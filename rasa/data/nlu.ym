        - Well, they use oxygen tanks and that they need oxygen in space.
        - let's talk about what STUDENT said before she said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great point a microscope is a great scientific tool.
        - Okay, gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. So I guess like I think that STUDENT and I are, so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct.
        - Okay, okay. Yeah, I can get that. 
        - I don't know, is it not a good answer?
        - I said that NASA sent a small machine and but I was wondering like why my answer was wrong, because it seems like the right answer. 
        - That's also a good point. Thank you STUDENT. Yes, convincing evidence. Thank you for that. 
        - Yes. Good job. STUDENT.
        - Right, so
        - That's Jethro STUDENT.
        - Okay, thank you STUDENT we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes.
        - Well, STUDENT. Why don't we, why don't we listen to STUDENT answer and then we'll talk about your answer in just a minute. Okay?
        - yep exactly you said it perfectly yeah.
        - So STUDENT you told me that NASA sent a small machine right?
        - tool called a microscope
        - Okay, that's fine. Yeah, we'll go around the room and when I get to you. I'll let you ask your specific question. Okay.
        - It's right on to that. Hold on just a minute and
        - Okay, perfect. All right, STUDENT. I really enjoyed reading your response.
        - Great. Those are two important aspects to focus on. 
        - Um, I'll me let me look down, um, water on the moon. Yeah, water on the moon.
        - STUDENT I'm going to work with you independently in one minute. Okay.
        - Microscope. Ok.
        - that's what I was gonna say too
        - yeah you guys you did awesome great okay.
        - And I see that you answered scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.  
        - Alright perfect you take a minute, while I go over to STUDENT.
        - um yeah so I circled the same answer as Savanannah and that's a microscope.
        - you're right.
        - What equipment scientists use to discover the water on the moon, but all of our other observations were also really close so.
        - We take a bath here, and we drink water a lot. And I was remembering what STUDENT and STUDENT were talking about. And yes, you need water to live. And so yes, that's what I was thinking. Yes.
        - Oh really, that is awesome
        - So thinking about the tools that the scientists use to discover water on the moon, I know you guys mentioned lots of different equipment the oxygen tanks the lunar orbiter the microscope sometimes they just found it in craters 
        - Story. So, STUDENT said NASA send a small machine. Okay, so I love how you did that. 
        - Oh, oh OK OK um oh well it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch.
        - That's a very good point.
        - I thought it was pretty cool you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah.
        - huh yes and a couple of you guys did revise your answers and you did a great job with that revision 
        - And STUDENT. I love that you mentioned the Lunar Orbiter, 
        - Perfect.
        - hi STUDENT I see you've got your hand.
        - That is very
        - Well said. It is a tool, you're correct. So let's right let's write that down. I'll keep that in note and I'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had. But thank you for volunteering. 
        - Exactly, so we can always write that too, I think your answer right now is just as good though. Good job.
        - Good good good job I like that I like that could reply STUDENT I see your hand up.
        - Yes, and survey, Anna.
        - Oh yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt. I know this was really, really short, and we just met, but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch. But I really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us, and I mean I didn't say anything, but you really listen to everybody sharing their ideas, and that was really nice. Thank you.
        - Thanks STUDENT. STUDENT
        - is called know the Lunar Rover I think.
        - Uh, so, for example, a STUDENT, you put that you need a scientific tool called a microscope. Now,
        - I'm glad you said you know a lot about space. So that means something that probably interest you a lot.
        - Yeah. Yes. I could see how you say that yes
        - I see, that I understand. um let's move on to STUDENT, and then STUDENT I'll come back to you if you're still confused by the end of it okay.
        - STUDENT, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope.
        - My answer, my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that OK.
        - Yes. Yes.
        - Amazing. Yes. 
        - Yes, that's a really good answer. Thank you. Yes, mean you are right.
        - Good. Good answer. Thank you. 
        - Yep, just give me a moment STUDENT. I'm going to have everyone. Think about it for 15 more seconds, then I'll come to you. Okay.
        - Okay, Harisson, what, you had your question, a question just a few minutes ago. What was that question that you had?
        - Yeah, that was a big question.
        - Okay, your answer, no. It's not ready yet.
        - Thanks for thanks STUDENT I appreciate that.
        - You are correct. Very good. 
        - I'm going to go over to STUDENT, since we're low on time, STUDENT. You had your hand up. What were you gonna say
        - Right you're right STUDENT. so let's look.
        - so like STUDENT and STUDENT you guys said that you needed a scientific
        - Okay, thank you for that input. Okay. 
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter was used to investigate.
        - Right.
        - So I was I'm still I'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong, but I can't tell you what I was thinking. So basically, when I looked at the text like I saw
        - um.
        - So now let's look at your responses. So STUDENT you circled the same thing as STUDENT, and so, you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now I mean.
        - I kind of was thinking about what STUDENT and STUDENT were saying. And I was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what I mean, like, maybe you need a microscope to see
        - um yeah I, I also think it's valuable because if you split the water like I said i'm.
        - yeah you did a really great job.
        - So STUDENT, you said that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so, um, I circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - rocket fuel. That's right.
        - Good. Great memory, word for word exactly what the question was. Great job.
        - that's a great definition Thank you so much STUDENT 
        - yeah that's what it says in the story.
        - Um I learned to make sure that I read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear.
        - That is awesome. Thank you for sharing that. 
        - Yeah, I can add this is STUDENT.
        - You know all about space?
        - STUDENT and STUDENT. Let's look at yours. You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - So I said that NASA used like a small machine
        - There you go. Okay, STUDENT, what did you want to add?
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what STUDENT had said.
        - Yes, STUDENT, so on. That's awesome. Again, that you that you're reading about space. And that's awesome that you're excited about that. 
        - And that is a piece of equipment yeah.
        - So we'll start with STUDENT I your response was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - yeah okay.
        - Mostly the same stuff. All right, good. 
        - Thank you, STUDENT, for sure. STUDENT.
        - So she said, you need a scientific tool called a Microsoft to look really closely. 
        - Like, not a lot of it, maybe
        - Okay we'll leave that there STUDENT you have a question or a comment.
        - Yeah.
        - STUDENT that's awesome that's perfect that's a great sentence and you got great answers.
        - So STUDENT, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to work really closely. Yes. STUDENT
        - Okay, that is the name of the small machine.
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - It's one of the right answers. Yeah.
        - I understand that you had a similar response to STUDENT.
        - That is perfect clapping for you, that is awesome Thank you perfect alright STUDENT.
        - Okay, thank you.
        - Okay, great awesome.
        - Well, that was, I'm sorry. This was STUDENT. That was my answer from the beginning
        - i'll get right to you in just a minute.
        - I love that and your response was very interesting and we're going to we're going to talk about each one okay.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it. Okay, it's in the beginning, it says future astronauts could drink this water.
        - I'm really proud of you guys for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - yeah you so you feel you're all good.
        - So, it flies flies through space.
        - The water.
        - Yes, exactly.
        - Thank you so much.
        - Right. Nice job.
        - that's true okay so that's a very interesting fact 
        - Um, I think I would be convinced to maybe if it wasn't so hard to get the water and also from the first part, if there was more water because it said there's only like
        - That is cool.
        - Who else would like to share
        - Exactly.
        - Oh so is anybody using a microscope.
        - So I circled the same as STUDENT, and we both thought it was the microscope.
        - OK.
        - Yes, very good so again, it would be but.
        - know STUDENT your response was you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly.
        - Absolutely you're totally right,
        - I said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two.
        - um yeah I change my answer too. 
        - Yes that's one example, that is an example of a piece of equipment.
        - yeah and you you're correct STUDENT you did do that um.
        - Oh yes, that is where exactly it says that the ice deposits are very small,
        - um well I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now.
        - Awesome, thank you for sharing. I want you...
        - Thank you for your input, STUDENT But I just asked STUDENT a question. Would you mind letting her respond?
        - On yeah I guess I just wanted to say this, like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important.
        - so what I chose. I think I know the words, but I was wondering about equipment because I basically said the same thing as STUDENT. What was that it was the microscope.
        - yeah that's very true they use a lot of a lot of high tech tools like computers and.
        - Excellent.
        - Um, yeah. So what I was thinking was when I was looking through the reading. I was seeing like so in the in the question. 
        - Okay great, it's not needed. 
        - No teacher i'm sorry but it's actually time for us to go.
        - That's a good feedback. Yes, you can.
        - Absolutely, and that shows me that you really understood the text and what everybody's saying and before we move on intimacy you have your hand up, but before I answer you.
        - yep exactly STUDENT a lunar orbiter good job 
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - awesome that is a really great response so.
        - Right so perfect STUDENT.
        - Thank you alright STUDENT so, you said that NASA sent a small machine now.
        - I'm happy that you were able to learn from each other.
        - Well, first of all STUDENT I would just like to say, that's awesome. Um,
        - Oh good. Good job. Great job. All of you guys, I appreciate all of you guys volunteered to read, and you've all done a very good job. OK. So let's get through, if, do you guys have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil?
        - Microscope.
        - Yeah, so it's it's certainly mentioned that
        - It doesn't totally relate to water, but that is a really cool fact 
        - I'm sorry, what's the answer.
        - Thank you for that information. STUDENT.
        - STUDENT. You said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, that's really cool.
        - Yeah thanks for sharing that. 
        - Okay awesome.
        - So that's, that's good to know. Okay, so you have attempted to answer the question, which is good. Okay.
        - yeah you're absolutely right, so we talked about that.
        - That is correct. All right, STUDENT STUDENT you your response says water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. 
        - Yeah, I think microscope as well. And it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading. 
        - yep 100% true STUDENT.
        - Yeah, maybe I guess we'll have to wait and see. Right, yes STUDENT
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Was my answer. That's what I said that the scientists found craters full of water.
        - um so, unfortunately I know it was a really short time, but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and.
        - Yes, you are completely right that there is, there's a lot to kind of dissect in this. So you're right.
        - All to turn teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Lunar orbiter. That is correct.
        - And so that's why I thought it was the answer. Because in the text. Oh, I remember one thing I remember
        - STUDENT So you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks your responses. Very good. And though. 
        - Hmm, okay. So your answer was, I'm going to look back at at the answers you guys bad. So I'll go back to submit. So that is the answer the question for us, but I'll come to yours.
        - I think that's a great question and I don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it.
        - but for time we're gonna move on over to STUDENT.
        - You're right. That is a really good answer. So the as that.
        - Um, well, I was just gonna say like I i only underlined.
        - Ms. Teacher, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, you know, this was really short, and we just met, but I really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers.
        - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch
        - Thanks.
        - i'm teacher, I looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um, but I do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and.
        - STUDENT you, you had a similar response, you said that no it's not not ready yet so maybe.
        - Well, the water on the moon. The story said it's so small you can't see it.
        - Thank you.
        - yeah exactly 
        - Yeah, no problem.
        - And in fact, yet. STUDENT You keep on looking for that.
        - That's very good. That's very good. 
        - i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later.
        - it's a great answer scientists absolutely use microscopes all the time to look at really small things like, for example, water so that's a great idea that both of you had
        - That's absolutely true so far.
        - um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the Lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just all the equipment they used.
        - awesome, thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah STUDENT go for it.
        - Good job, STUDENT is exactly right. You look at paragraph three, you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope.
        - So did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine, STUDENT?
        - I'm wondering, though, because we had to work on it together, is my answer is my answer wrong?
        - Oh, good. That's right. That's right. I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer. STUDENT. Yes. So they sent mall machine. That's very good. You're exactly right. That's the tool that we're looking for.
        - Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually.
        - yeah right they do use a lot of equipment, I think my suggestion for you here because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment.
        - Are exactly right. So, uh, equipment is a tool. You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and
        - Maybe your answer is right. So you answer that that NASA send a small machine. And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there.
        - So your, your answer is not wrong. I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it. So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon. Does that help you understand more.
        - Your answer is not wrong. So this is a two part question.
        - Your answer is not wrong. That's not, that's not why you're in this group. I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine.
        - Actually yeah I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that
        - They did find craters full of water. 
        - But then why is my answer wrong?
        - I mean technically those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water let's think.
        - No, I was just wondering like what, if you remember the name, because that is correct that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon.
        - Oh, I didn't say that. No. No. No, your answer isn't wrong. We're just wanting to find kind of even more. OK? About it. So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?
        - Um, well, I said, pretty much the same thing as STUDENT, um, you know, like I thought it was the microscope.
        - Again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that.
        - Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use So if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer.
        - The different thing that they that they need, so they need.
        - mm hmm no you're not STUDENT you're not I want I want you to understand that you're not wrong.
        - Yeah, absolutely. Um, okay. So, in paragraph, paragraph three
        - Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than STUDENT 's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind so So why is mine wrong.
        - Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct. 
        - yeah it was a good answer.
        - Yeah, you are correct. STUDENT. 
        - yeah no that's a very well STUDENT developed answer 
        - Right. And that is correct. 
        - So yeah just kind of thinking about more like that, but you did great you know it was it was a good answer you did awesome i'm.
        - And STUDENT once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well.
        - yeah absolutely good job.
        - What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships.
        - Right right Do you remember okay I love that you're talking about the water because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right Do you remember
        - Sounds good.
        - Okay, so you're actually on the right track um I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong
        - That is equipment, you're correct. They have to use all those things before they can start their explorations. That is right STUDENT.
        - That was a wonderful answer. Does anyone else want to add their answer to it.
        - When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct
        - Oh, okay, okay.
        - Right, good. That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right
        - Um, yes microscope is a kind of a scientist tool.
        - Oh, right. So, it is a small machine that is correct.
        - Your answer is not wrong. So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely. Okay. You're right about that.
        - Exactly, exactly. We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water. 
        - You use those.
        - That's really, really cool. So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon. You guys all had responses that were definitely
        - Awesome. Well, I love this response that you have right now. That was amazing. 
        - Okay, thank you. So that's a great thing to circle. 
        - and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying.
        - yeah
        - Like you said to STUDENT, the name of the equipment, The name of the equipment that they used. Oh, yeah. I didn't write the name of the equipment.
        - Well, your answers aren't wrong, 
        - That's a very great response and great observation, based on the text.
        - It's not wrong. You're still correct they you will need a microscope. If you want to see the water. 
        - No. Your answer isn't wrong. 
        - Um, well, I mean, I just, I, I feel like I i put words down from from story and
        - All right. Awesome. I really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on Earth. That was really wonderful. 
        - I don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way I was thinking about so here, so I actually just bought my own kids.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this.
        - Yeah. Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong. 
        - It's not wrong. 
        - Orbiter. Good job. Okay. So you said. They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here. 
        -  But that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well. So thank you for adding that
        - That a small machine did collect the water on the moon.
        - Yeah, yeah. I thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong.
        - Um, that's really interesting. STUDENT, because you're right to look at something really closely, you would need a microscope. But let's think.
        - And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct, 
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water, 
        - Okay, and STUDENT. Your answer is not wrong. 
        - So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which - that's a great piece of knowledge. That's something we always want to keep with us.
        - So yeah, I think it was a small machine. The lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon. And then I guess it lands on the moon, and then it would discover the water, I think
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon, and there was some water in there,
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right. 
        - No, ma'am. You can keep your answer the same.
        - well.
        - Perfect. Excellent. Okay, STUDENT.
        - I don't necessarily think any one answer was.
        - Everybody's answer was correct.
        - Yeah, that's a great point. STUDENT. So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon. So yeah, you would need that equipment.
        - A microscope was used. There was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment
        - STUDENT no one ever said, your answer was wrong and your answer, I would say right now, your answer is not wrong.
        - yeah they That is exactly what the story said, and that was a really good observation 
        - Very good. That's a very good answer. 
        - No. Craters aren't equipment. So I guess no.
        - That's very true. That's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon. 
        - um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water. That is perfectly correct STUDENT and I don't think your answers wrong I just think.
        - Your answer isn't really wrong. It's not wrong, STUDENT.
        - yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um.
        - I don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all. It was a small machine.
        - You guys were all mostly right in your responses. Yes, STUDENT, you said you circled the same as STUDENT.
        - And that's right, STUDENT did choose a correct objects,
        - Right. And I'm not saying your, your answer is wrong. 
        - And I think STUDENT did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that. Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for.
        - So I think your answers - none of your answers are wrong. I think sometimes they can use improvement. But STUDENT, I do want to point out that your response. 
        - Awesome STUDENT Thank you so much so, you said that NASA sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for
        - Okay, I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong, I actually I don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong, I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space.
        - Okay, so that could be a one use of water. STUDENT?
        - Yes, yep you are.
        - I think what STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text. 
        - Yeah, I actually, I do because I know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something. And so I'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story. So like if there weren't even astronauts, they wouldn't really need a microscope.
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can.
        - They have the oxygen tanks, because they need to be able to breathe.
        - It's not that your answers are wrong. 
        - Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to.
        - A small machine that is correct.
        - Great, so that's that's a good answer
        - Oh yeah. Okay. So, in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So you have to see it. You can't see it without microscope.
        - STUDENT, when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, I think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right.
        - So your answer is correct, and you did a great job with your thinking. 
        - Expeditions they need oxygen like STUDENT said they need the proper space equipment. If they're leaving our earth.
        - Now, these are all true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right.
        - Oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong, 
        - Yes, that is correct.
        - Okay, I'll work on that.
        - Mm hmm. You're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool. And that's what the question was asking was asking which tools, specifically did they use to find this water, and I believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right everybody read the reading?
        - What we never said you guys answers were wrong. 
        - Yeah. Scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank.
        - Mm hmm. Um, let's see, I so your answer wasn't wrong.
        - yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water.
        - That's right. You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need. So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why.
        - And we all gave really good answers.
        - Okay STUDENT 's answer was about how they got to the moon, okay so astronaut have to have things to fly around and have oxygen in order to get to the moon. That is correct. 
        - And STUDENT, you rightly said that it's a machine.
        - Very good. So like STUDENT said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon.
        - Right. So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space. You are correct.
        - But the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding
        - I think so, like, do I need to. I need them. They need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way.
        - It is. It is, I didn't say it was wrong.
        - It's not wrong at all. 
        - Your, your answer is not wrong.
        - Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool. Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as
        - yeah um but other than that I, I thank you guys, like all the guys, I think I understood the passages like Well, yes, that.
        - I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water.
        - Oh, okay, great.
        - Your answer is. So you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it. Right, STUDENT?
        - Well, your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct NASA did send a small machine
        - Yes, the scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That is the result. Right.
        - Yeah. So, you are correct. 
        - Perfect. And, you know, that was a very good answer. Thank you for sharing.
        - It would and it would be really useful too. STUDENT What about you.
        - STUDENT your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct
        - You're right. You're so right. If there are astronauts on the moon. There needs to be oxygen tags.
        - STUDENT your answer is not necessarily wrong.
        - With what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon.
        - STUDENT I want to go back to your answer. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And that is very, very true, 
        - You're not wrong and I didn't even think of it that way. So I'm glad you brought this point up
        - We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but
        - The question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon. And that's why I said I'm the small machine I that's why I picked the one from paragraph to because
        - Scientists are a part of it. 
        - So that's actually, I'm glad you said that because that's part of the process. We didn't necessarily talk about in this text. Or in this section of the text.
        - You did, um. 
        - It's not wrong, 
        - You're right on what you said.
        - Um, I'm not sure. Um, I have to read it through again. Okay.
        - The only person STUDENT is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable.
        - So in essence kind of both of them are correct. 
        - All right, no one's wrong. I want to make that very clear. No one's wrong. We're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right.
        - You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - mm hmm yeah so you are completely correct NASA did send a small machine and that was used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yes. Thank you. That's great. I'm so glad that you could clarify.
        - You got a lot closer there. I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there. So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        - Right. So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon, 
        - Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon.
        - that's a great answer um.
        - Um, so your answer to your answer is correct, right.
        - I like that. That's a really good way of thinking about it. What does anyone else-
        - Good. Good job. All right. STUDENT You have a question?
        - So, STUDENT, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect. Your answer's your answer is correct.
        - Alright awesome STUDENT I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon.
        - With your answer is not completely wrong. It's more than it's just missing a little bit of information.
        - Well, I'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does.
        - um well I I said it wasn't ready yet so I said no too.  
        - In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it.
        - Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake. Those are great job, guys. Thank you.
        - Okay. So you're absolutely right. And it's not your answer isn't wrong,
        - And I see it's the microscope. Very good, very good. Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        - Now, they discovered the water. You got that right on the nose.
        - So, so how come I'm in this group.
        - Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something. 
        - No, I'm not saying your answers wrong. 
        - Well, I don't know because I thought it was the microscope, because how can you find something if it's too small to see.
        - that's really great point 
        - that's that's exactly right STUDENT The one thing that that you said that I want to clarify, as you mentioned.
        - Yeah, that's really cool.
        - That is true. You could if there's enough water.
        - Right. So that answers the question. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. That's great. Nice work!
        - Yeah, exactly. So they had to use the microscope to find it. 
        - You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything. I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct. 
        - Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question. Um, so here's the thing. Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong.
        - That's a very good point. You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - Oh no, I was just
        - So yeah, I think I might have seen that at NASA, I just realized that, cool
        - Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet. We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us.
        - For sure yeah that's great that's great that's a great connection.
        - Do I do i'm sure you do, you probably know a lot more about space and idea my son is actually named STUDENT as well, so I feel like we got that connection already what's um I don't know when I was your age I loved space, so I was particularly excited to read this article.
        - Maybe you can help us with a couple things STUDENT 
        - I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today. I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today.
        - You are awesome you know a lot about the stage and equipment yeah.
        - Okay, so, and STUDENT brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that. That's a good point. 
        - Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you
        - Yes, absolutely, and so I and that's why i'm so excited to have all of you in this group, because all of you bring such a great.
        - Well i'm excited for you to share all your knowledge with your other classmates.
        - Yes, that is so true and STUDENT you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right.
        - Very good. I like how you connected your experience of going to NASA to help you understand and reading the text better. That's a great experience you had a bet that was really cool.
        - And they would need those on the moon. And I know you said you know a lot about space. So that is a very good response.
        - Me and my dad went
        - Yeah, great. I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge. 
        - But one of the reasons that I wanted to to have you here, besides the fact that you're our in house space expert.
        - but I am so glad that you are passionate about this subject that's going to help us.
        - Great it look like you're an expert in our group. So maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge. Okay.
        - And so we I know STUDENT you know a lot about this. 
        - OK. OK. OK, well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say, Mr. Dallas, thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on. So now I know that I should explain my ideas or say them in my own words, even if they're the same as what somebody else said. And then I also heard you tell STUDENT what she should work on, too. So thank you very much.
        - I do 
        - Right. So that's really cool that you've been to NASA and you have all this background knowledge. 
        - Well, STUDENT, if that's the case um you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space is that all right.
        - awesome I love that you spend time to learn about science outside of class that's really impressive.
        - But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so
        - um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um STUDENT 
        - You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses.
        - Okay, yeah, I can do that.
        - Okay, so we're going to work on that. But it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions.
        - that's good that you actually went to NASA you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool.
        - I can tell you anything you want to know.
        - Awesome so STUDENT used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome. STUDENT
        - yeah that's great again I love the background info 
        - me yeah no you're so right that sounds like a really cool trip to NASA and you're right that scientists at NASA use a lot of different equipment.
        - Or maybe you could help us out.
        - and also, you can help share share some stuff with other people in the class.
        - Do you really?
        - awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that.
        - Oh yeah I can definitely help out.
        - that's right yeah so just like STUDENT was saying there's a lot of equipment when you're out in space.
        - Okay, that sounds okay okay.
        - Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, 
        - Do you know what since you know so much about space when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know. But I need
        - Wow, to know all about space, you must know a lot
        - So STUDENT, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses. 
        - You don't think you should be in this group. Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered. So I'm glad you're here with us. 
        - Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space. 
        - Yeah, I, I'm kind of space expert on which is why I picked oxygen tanks. That's my answer.
        - I said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit.
        - yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it STUDENT, so that's- Now, if the question had asked about your personal experience, then you could mention what you had seen at NASA, that would be very interesting for sure, ok?
        - To help us with some information that might not even be in the text. So you might be able to help us add some additional info but
        - Wow, that seems really awesome.
        - That's really awesome. STUDENT I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon.
        - so i'm really going to value your opinion STUDENT.
        - Yeah, awesome.
        - Well, you know, that's I'm glad you reiterate that, again, STUDENT, because since you're the expert, we may be coming back to you.
        - Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions.
        - Thank you for the enthusiasm STUDENT about space. Right now we're just focusing on text based evidence. So it's awesome that you already have some background knowledge in this topic.
        - So did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew?
        - Okay um well I I circled the same as STUDENT, which was the microscope I think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at STUDENT was just reading about.
        - Oh, that's okay. Well, we can always learn new things about topics. So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it.
        - Wow, great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our group, so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding, or all the things they want to know, okay?
        - Yeah, well, they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water. 
        - Yes, that is, I love that you already know a lot about space STUDENT
        - All
        - that's very cool I have not been to NASA i've always wanted to go that's really cool that you got to go.
        - yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - STUDENT you know what.
        - all right awesome job STUDENT I like that you didn't.
        - Oh yeah, that sounds awesome.
        - um well actually I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful Thank you so much.
        - you're right they do use all of those pieces of equipment, I want you to not let's not answer out loud, but I just want you to think about.
        - And you know i'm excited actually STUDENT to learn, you know from you and you learn from one another,
        - Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space
        - Maybe that you can teach the rest of us about
        - You do know a lot about space.
        - OK. Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this group so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better.
        - Oh well, STUDENT, and that's exactly why we need you in here. We need you in here to help help us out. 
        - um okay well so i'm in the article
        - And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA 
        - Background knowledge. Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us.
        - That's really good that you know all those things, STUDENT. Those are really good things to know. It's really interesting.
        - Okay, I can do that.
        - Well i'm glad you know a lot about space, and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our group conversation.
        - Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question.
        - I've never been the NASA. So that's really cool that you have that experience.
        - and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge.
        - So, we could say, like all of the equipment for the answer.
        - Yes, and these are amazing tools and requirements that they have to be wearing before they go there
        - um I think it's good to talk about this what we read together, so we can help us help each other understand it more. So it's great that you know a lot about space. Maybe you can share that with us.
        - By 2024 yeah, that is, but I think it's totally possible 
        - Oh, you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this group, because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space.
        - Recognizes student background knowledge without a connection to text or task
        - yeah geology is like the study of rocks.
        - uh huh oh that's cool yeah.
        - So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too.
        - So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use.
        - And you could help us to understand better
        - Oh, maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us?
        - You already know all about space that makes me so happy because we're going to be able to use your knowledge as an expert about space to help teach the rest of our group, so i'm going to definitely be relying on you STUDENT. So thank you for sharing that with me before we get started.
        - Yeah, me and my dad went.
        - I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there.
        - that's a really good point I you know I wish the article would have talked about that, I guess, I guess, sometimes the.
        - Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward. Maybe I'll have you been one of our group leaders. Okay.
        - And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group. Okay, so
        - Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important. So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know.
        - Oh yeah, I know. Like, all kinds of stuff about that and I LIKE I REALLY KNOW ABOUT
        - Yeah, I can do that.
        - Okay, we are going to use your
        - You know all about space? 
        - Absolutely, and that I think that that would isn't, I mean everyone else might agree as well that that's an amazing inference right, you can think about.
        - Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information. 
        - Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space.
        - Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome STUDENT, 
        - They do. They use all of that. That's really great. So that's what we would call background knowledge. That's stuff that you know before even reading the article, and that's really awesome.
        - mm hmm yeah you're right yeah I think there haven't been astronauts on the moon, for a little while but they definitely NASA does send astronauts, I think, to the international space station regularly.
        - Thank you, STUDENT, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work.
        - But you guys did a really, really good job because you have their fantastic knowledge about space and about moon
        - yeah absolutely and i'm loving that i'm getting to spend some time with just the five of you, and I think we can all really learn from each other, like I mentioned earlier, with STUDENT.
        - and you'll be able to share all your knowledge.
        - STUDENT we need some space expertise and so it's always good to have you in the room anytime we're talking about space.
        - I thought so that's why I had to say it.
        - I guess what, if you could use some of what you know about space and maybe share that with the group? 
        - That is so awesome that you are telling me how knowledgeable you are now how motivated, you are in terms of subjects, so I can't really I can't wait to hear your response, and in fact I already heard you.
        - Oh yeah, of course.
        - Well, I was thinking that you know how I learned a lot about science is by I'm watching YouTube videos and and and watching the show on on on Nova show on PBS. So I was thinking that maybe STUDENT needs to watch more more science videos.
        - yeah it was an amazing trip, we got to see so many different things there.
        - That's great. Thank you.
        - Yeah, I can.
        - Well, so, as you just said about yourself you're really an expert in this, and I really appreciate that you um.
        - Yeah, that's great. That's a great connection. How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that.
        - Oh wow, that's so cool STUDENT. Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks. How, what it does to look for the water
        - I haven't heard that so that's really interesting and that was that was good that you were like using what you found in this text along with what you already heard before so very interesting.
        - Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that. I bet not everyone has. I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class.
        - You'd be a really great resource for us. So why don't you hang tight. 
        - cool always so interesting to apply your outside knowledge to what we're learning in class.
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in.
        - yeah you're absolutely correct they do use all that equipment.
        - And that obviously shows your understanding of space. That's really cool. 
        -  and I would love to hear what you think about space.
        - um yeah I can do that sure.
        - that's great and I love that you already know a lot about space, but what I think is.
        - wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all.
        - Hopefully one day, Kevin. Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well.
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn.
        - For me response. You do know quite a lot. So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here.
        - Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates.
        - Oh well, that's great but we're you can help everyone else.
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class.
        - That is awesome that you know all the extra stuff. And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your
        - But that's really cool that your dad is an astronaut about that's that's fun to talk about
        - You know I know you know about space, I saw your response, about the oxygen tanks, which is awesome because.
        - and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text.
        - that's pretty cool, then you can you can be the reporter slash facilitator discussion leader, for your small group discussion is that all right.
        - There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space. Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA
        - Yeah I know all about it. My dad's an astronaut
        - yeah yeah i'd love to hear that.
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up.
        - yeah Okay, I can do that.
        - Yeah, that sounds great.
        - But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive.
        - that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that.
        - Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation.
        - Okay, I found it so it was in the um third paragraph.
        - maybe you can help your partner's out STUDENT I think you would be a great addition to our group.
        - I mean, obviously you need oxygen to survive. So that's a very good observation. 
        - Well, that would be awesome. I didn't know that you taught me something.
        - No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job.
        - have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used.
        - That's awesome. So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future, 
        - Yes, but you can help some of the other students. So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well.
        - Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space. So when we cover more about space. It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates. Right.
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right. STUDENT. Thank you for sharing with us. We all seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um
        - And that's okay, maybe you can help me help someone else later. Let's wait off on that. Okay.
        - Well that's actually really good that you say that STUDENT so since you actually know a lot about space, hopefully, you can help us in our peers get to the final answer How does that sound?
        - That is great that you bring so much knowledge to this group STUDENT and hopefully your knowledge can help the group to understand more about space as well, 
        - Okay so awesome. What you have STUDENT is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic. That's great.
        - you I bet you could definitely add a lot of a lot of strengths this group, a lot of knowledge to this group.
        - Now, STUDENT, our science expert.
        - Yeah I know but maybe you can help us. Okay.
        - Okay, yeah, that sounds great.
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way. Okay.
        - I can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer. 
        - Awesome. Well, that's really cool. And the fact that you guys know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect
        - Oh well, I really need you to stay in our group and and you can help me with like information and things. Okay.
        - um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right.
        - So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts.
        - How, okay.
        - Yeah. Okay, I can do that.
        - So, okay, yeah.
        - Oh STUDENT, you know a lot of our space.
        - So you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good, of how you know
        - No worries. So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and STUDENT You may know more about space than everyone else in the group.
        - So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things. And like you said you know a lot about space. So you've seen that they can use a lot of things.
        - I have. Yeah.
        - SO let's look there. They did find water on the moon. That is correct. Yeah you STUDENT.
        - Ok, um NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, a lunar orbiter. So you're absolutely right. So,
        - Yeah, exactly. So good.
        - Okay? NASA sent a small machine
        - Well, I guess, I'm not sure, I guess think about it. 
        - Yeah well I'm still kind of confused.
        - They could breathe it. 
        - Okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when I go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool
        - I think you, you're absolutely right. It is find water. 
        - Yes, NASA used a small machine.
        - equipment and discover or two great words
        - yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. 
        - Um yeah I wondering like, I think I'm still confused. Like why my answer is wrong.
        - Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I really wanted to thank you
        - I think that STUDENT just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future .
        - Words in paragraph three
        - And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yes. That's exactly right. Nice work, STUDENT.
        - Excellent. So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter. 
        - I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits.
        - Right
        - A lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, OK, I see that make sense.
        -  and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and 
        - Um well so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class.
        - I like that, so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - Yeah, you are correct. There is there is something new for us. We didn't know that we can get water on the moon. 
        - Yeah. So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter. 
        - That was a perfect response.
        - Yeah. Alright, so there's that. That's a, that's a good valuable reason to have water on the moon.
        - Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Yes STUDENT. 
        - Oh wow, okay. Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how
        - and you put it out perfectly. It could be useful in lots of ways. So it could be very important.
        - Mhmm. It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water. 
        - Good a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine. 
        - Totally.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. I think a lunar orbiter is really key here. Right. They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon. Without that sort of orbiter right
        - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So did they use the microscope. I'm like, it sounds like they used it. So I guess. Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope. 
        - Discover, that's great.
        - To look at the water.
        - Yes. Good work. That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon. Nice job, STUDENT. 
        - Correct.
        - Very well. So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said
        - So the answer for STUDENT was correct one right.
        - And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Discover. Okay, good. What else
        - Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need.
        - That is correct. You did very well. It's the Lunar Orbiter. That's how they actually examine the water and the craters. Yes, STUDENT?
        - Absolutely. So we can use water as rocket fuel. Okay.
        - No that's a great point STUDENT I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text.
        - Okay, okay.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. Right.
        - That's the answer that I was looking for.
        - A tool. That's exactly right. So,
        - Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect
        - Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea Thank you so much.
        - So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,
        - Right. Once they found it.
        - Exactly, yes. STUDENT.
        - Okay, so
        - Part Three okay.
        - Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what STUDENT said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff. So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?
        - Excuse me, must go on. I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say.
        - That's right. So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter. Correct. Good job. 
        - They did. So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon. 
        - That's right, they could drink the water in the future.
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.
        - so my answer with this. It was NASA send a small machine, but I was like why why is my answer wrong.
        - Investigated.
        - Oh, OK.
        - Exactly right. Yes.
        - All right, the lunor orbiter.
        - Yes, you are. Your right. 
        - Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water
        - Yes, lunar orbiter. 
        - Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good all right
        - That's right. Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment. 
        - Yeah definitely is very important. Thank you for for responding. 
        - Alright perfect awesome.
        - yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword, 
        - Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think.  STUDENT.
        - Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT I think y'all were spot on.
        - Yes, you are right. 
        - Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel 
        - Yes, perfect.
        - but the Lunar Orbiter it's what they use to find water on the moon
        - Oh, so I just had to say the name
        - yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um.
        - There you go. So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters.
        - that's perfect Thank you STUDENT, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what STUDENT just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question STUDENT or maybe something you want to add.
        - I think you're right, I think you do, 
        - That is right. That is a good job, STUDENT. Thank you. 
        - Awesome. So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon. Alright so next time.
        - Very good, very good. STUDENT so investigate. Okay. 
        - yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job.
        - Okay, that makes sense because.
        - You're off to a good start, like how you said he's a word from the story. 
        - Oh, absolutely would be expensive. Yes, STUDENT.
        - Okay equipment to discover water and STUDENT.
        - Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?
        - And you're right we so we do need that. 
        - Perfect. Great job, STUDENT.
        - That's correct.
        - Good. So it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool. 
        - It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, but you know it. 
        - You are correct STUDENT it does mean really, really small 
        - yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools.
        - There you go. Discover water right so
        - I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy. And it says,
        - Well for me, I was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question.
        - Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable. 
        - Yeah, there you go. There you go. Perfect. 
        - Yes, which you did, so awesome. 
        - What's right
        - I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um.
        - The microscope. Great job. STUDENT.
        - That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover. So I think that's what they said discovered the water
        - That's great. That's absolutely right. So guys, I want you to think. So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So they were really small.
        - Awesome. Thank you for letting me. I think we're getting to the right place.
        - Yeah, exactly. Thank you for sharing STUDENT, so the water was found in this craters.
        - Sorry to interrupt. I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go. So we'll have to see you later.
        - I'm okay. It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that.
        - To find water on the moon, and because.
        - So, that's awesome.
        - They still had to use it. Correct.
        - that's correct that's correct very good STUDENT 
        - Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes.
        - Recognizes or repeats a correct student response with no information
        - Thank you for that answer. STUDENT. Thank you. I agree, it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is. 
        - Good. So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have, 
        - Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it.
        - yeah well um I said, I said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time. 
        - Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun. Thank you so much.
        - So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate.
        - Yes, that's a great example STUDENT, thank you for explaining that to us.
        - Good job, STUDENT. Thank you so much. Miss STUDENT.
        - In the craters.
        - Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon
        - Great. So the small machine is the lunar...
        - OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?
        - There you go. And it's a lot easier to get out into space. 
        - amazing that is just what I was looking for.
        - Good split it in two parts.
        - That's exactly right.
        - Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,
        - equipment whoa that's really great 
        - Yeah, correct. STUDENT So the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yeah, so that's that's the small machine. They sent 
        - Right, you use it to look at the water. 
        - I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go.
        - yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use 
        - Oh, absolutely. That's how they would find it.
        - Great work. 
        - Yes, that's a great example, thank you STUDENT for that. 
        - Just those two pieces of equipment. Okay, wonderful.
        - Yes, exactly. 
        - Yes, more details.
        - Oh that's a great answer STUDENT.
        - Yes, it does. And I'm but yes you are. You two are correct. It is the Lunar Orbiter. So you are right there. 
        - Awesome. So you have the lunar. You're right. 
        - Or good STUDENT I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you. You're correct. So, good job.
        - Oh that's it?
        - Right. That is exactly right. 
        - Ok ok so scientists sent the Lunar Orbiter to the moon.
        - Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon.
        - Yes. So that is the equipment.
        - All right, STUDENT, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater.
        - Correct. It was a machine called a lunar orbiter and STUDENT did a good job, remembering that it was a small machine.
        - STUDENT you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore. Correct.
        - So yes, that is one of the answers to that. The equipment was used to find water on the moon. So great job.
        - Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large
        - I think I already put evidence in my answer too.
        - Very good, very good.
        - I was thinking discover
        - nailed it yes STUDENT high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great.
        - Okay, awesome. So that is a great word to underline, did anybody else underline anything else.
        - Yeah, right I see that too, I see that too.
        - Okay, so a microscopic okay, so the lunar orbiter is what you use to discover the water
        - Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found. Mm hmm.
        - Yeah. No, you're right. STUDENT that
        - awesome job STUDENT
        - You are correct. Yes, STUDENT
        - Yeah. Okay, great, great job. Okay.
        - Yeah, your right. 
        - Good, good, good. I know what I mean.
        - Bring their own right?
        - All right, very good. So it's a STUDENT device that is used right?
        - I agree. So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important. So
        - So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine. 

- intent: r120
  examples: |
        - Good so when you go and you look through the text, I want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay.
        - I think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use
        - Well that's, well, that's great. So, STUDENT, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?
        - Does anybody know
        - But what did they use to find actually water on the moon.
        - Where the water is?
        - You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers, 
        - How did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when I was saying, like i'm trying to figure out.
        - Yes, let's go back and look. Everybody taken another second. I'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text.
        - Yeah, so I guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks, like when they're looking at the water on the moon.
        - Well, I was wondering
        - What?
        - Who can answer that question.
        - And see if you can find something different.
        - I guess your I can try again. Because if I have to pick one from the story, I would say.
        - So what machine. Did they use to find that water.
        - Because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle.
        - Try again.
        - You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something.
        - Um, yeah. Okay. So I actually was kind of agreeing with STUDENT Like my dad took me to NASA. And we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have, like, um,
        - so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of.
        - STUDENT. I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see.
        - I wasn't sure. Like, why my answer was wrong.
        - And again, STUDENT, what was the question.
        - Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better.
        - Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start.
        - Um, well you did say that, um, you can't look if you're looking at the water than your, you have to first. That's the second stop. So then, um, I guess I have to look for the first step I gosh
        - Okay, I'll call on you in a second. 
        - Alright, so, from what I read what other
        - Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph STUDENT do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer.
        - So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - Yeah, I think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and I think, I guess I'm confused, like why is my answer wrong?
        - I circled equipment. 
        - Right and.
        - Thank you, STUDENT. So after reading that statement. What did we learn
        - Is that all that they used?
        - All right. So why is it valuable to find water on the moon?
        - You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure 
        - Okay. And when you get to that part. Please raise your hand and let me know. We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used. Okay.
        - So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use.
        - Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that.
        - So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer.
        - yeah well, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go. But I was listening to what you're telling everybody else, and I think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer.
        - Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down.
        - You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?
        - And so let's look back and see. So, STUDENT and STUDENT  I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer.
        - The principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up.
        - Um. Is it the microscope? I'm not sure
        - Alright, so, STUDENT. Let's get to you. Alright, so read me your answer.
        - I don't see anything that said discover in the story I'll look again.
        - Okay, I'll read it.
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer. You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer. 
        - Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer.
        - Well, let's take a look. I want you guys to look. I know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three, and I'm going to read that to you real quick. Okay.
        - Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think
        - Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon.
        - You told STUDENT that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so I think you told her that that was the answer right?
        - Okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us.
        - So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question.
        - and I have your answers so STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close. Did you see any other tools that you may need
        - Is there anything you want to maybe add to that.
        - I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it.
        - Yeah, I'll look
        - So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence.
        - Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger.
        - So, so
        - Um well for me I dont know
        - Hi everybody. So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - Good. Okay. So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon.
        - Um, what is the question asking us
        - Um, well. Like, I guess, I guess no cuz like I guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water.
        - So, STUDENT, and STUDENT. You guys have been working together and STUDENT, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?
        - Um, ah, You mean nothing like that what you told STUDENT about?
        - So I want someone else to answer my question again. Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time. So STUDENT, do you want to try?
        - So, STUDENT. Can you just tell me what that question means
        - but um let's let's keep building on that right good STUDENT.
        - What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though.
        - Great. Yes. So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that. Are you able to do that for me.
        - Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs.
        - Like, what is the machine?
        - Can you remember what was that?
        - So what about you, STUDENT
        - I'm not really sure.
        - let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water. 
        - If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine.
        - STUDENT can you add on.
        - Yeah. So basically, um,
        - Yeah, I guess so. Um, but I do know, like a lot. I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Number three. Read again number three. The paragraph number
        - STUDENT, what is the second heading.
        - Number three. Okay. I'm not really sure.
        - Well, I thought that was the correct tool.
        - STUDENT. Did you find that answer in there?
        - What STUDENT?
        - that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay.
        - Small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water.
        - Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use.
        - Valuable means like something that's really important. Like, um, um, yeah, something that's important.
        - Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully. Huh.
        - Oh no, I read the whole thing. I was gonna say the same thing that STUDENT said like when you're asked me to look for equipment. I found two pieces of equipment.
        - Yeah yeah discover
        - I'm not sure. Like, what would I add?
        - but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon.
        - I underlined it
        - Ah I'm sorry, Mr. Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong, too.
        - I'll try. OK. So the lunar orbiter sends-- the lunar orbiter--
        - Uh-huh. Oh, you know what else?
        - Oh, oh, I didn't even I didn't actually say that they said, I just said that they sent a small machine.
        - Okay, do you have something to add to STUDENT 's answer.
        - Okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense, all look again.
        - What did you get out of the question
        - You guys look
        - So what's another word.
        - Um, yeah. Well, before I do that, I just wanted to say I'm STUDENT
        - Yeah, because we could. Okay, so we should look for I should look for more equipment?
        - Yeah, I'll try. I'll see what I can find.
        - Water is a valuable resource.
        - Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it.  
        - And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer.
        - So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found.
        - What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it. Is there any other equipment that we need
        - But I want us to go back and look at that again.
        - What is the question actually ask us
        - it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include. STUDENT what's up it's your turn.
        - So look back at your answer.
        - Right. But what else did you need to know?
        - To see if there is convincing evidence because
        - Was there anything else in the text.
        - So why don't you go back to your passages and You know circle some or go back to the question and read it again, and let me know if you have any questions. 
        - Yeah, oh look, oh look in the story again.
        - OK. So STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So look back in paragraph 3.
        - I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,
        - Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that STUDENT helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using.
        - They do, and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there. That's a very good point. But just like we were telling Mr. STUDENT, we have to find it in the text
        - Still confused because i i i guess why the microscope. Is it, you know what I mean is it an answer too?
        - Does anybody have an idea.
        - That wasn't STUDENT or STUDENT 's answer?
        - Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey. STUDENT I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer.
        - Yeah. So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research.
        - Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?
        - Oh well i i i had some equipment, but I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - water.
        - But what did they use on the moon to discover water. Do you know what that that tool was called
        - Okay, so we used to think it was the microscope, and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover. So I guess if I was doing this again, maybe I would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word
        - So we can go ahead and go back. I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up.
        - I guess I was I was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water, because craters are really big, right?
        - Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text.
        - When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate. Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home.
        - I see some few shaking their head. No. Huh. Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text.
        - You know I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - So STUDENT our science expert, out of paragraph two. How do we answer this question. What was your response?
        - Oh, the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So on there, you can make that on so again. 
        - Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay. So I want everybody to just look at paragraph two, and I want you to read along with me. Okay.
        - Using this strategy. How would you answer that question. No.
        - Alright so STUDENT Can you help me out after reading the story again. 
        - but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing. Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon. Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water.
        - Me? What do I think?
        - An answer for that.
        - STUDENT, you want to add something?
        - Let's see, STUDENT. Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over. Would you like more time?
        - Yeah, about the water?
        - Yet so basically so and STUDENT was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - I think we're all ready.
        - Um, okay. Um, so the scientists sent, what the name of the thing. 
        - Water. Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text.
        - So, STUDENT. Let's discuss your answer real quick. Okay.
        - That doesn't. Alright, so how. So how would you rephrase your, your answer.
        - Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon.
        - How about you and STUDENT kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text.
        - Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer.
        - So well I check in with STUDENT. Do you think that you could work on that a little bit.
        - But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool. Did they have to use
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so I had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely, you know, like at the water
        - um do you STUDENT or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about.
        - Okay, what else?
        - and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it.
        - Go ahead, keep going.
        - What does it say in the article about what machine or equipment went to the moon.
        - Does anyone else want to try the question again besides STUDENT? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time. Maybe STUDENT, do you want to try it? STUDENT, do you want to try. OK.
        - item that they need on the moon.
        - What do we think they used
        - What do you think this STUDENT?
        - Um, so my answer was, I guess no, that it wasn't very convincing, because kind of like what STUDENT said like, we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time, you know,
        - STUDENT Let's talk about your answer.
        - teacher, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share
        - Allright STUDENT while you were reading. Did you find any more information.
        - You can, did you want to give that a try.
        - All right, STUDENT, um, what was, what was your response.
        - Yeah, so you know what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon. Oh yeah, STUDENT.
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - If we now we went back to answer that question right what equipment did did did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Right. But can you find what the what NASA used to investigate the water on the moon?
        - Well, I know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question.
        - To put into one general idea to answer this question, so also the question more time what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
        - When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - and let's think back to the question that we, we were asked. what tools did the astronauts use to discover water on the moon 
        - Okay, let's think back to the question. The question was what equipment did NASA use to find water on the moon. 
        - I'll say mine.
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - I just wanted to remind you, my dad's actually an astronaut.
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Like, okay, so like I went to NASA, like with my dad and like I like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what STUDENT was saying like I saw it in the exhibits like I i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff.
        - We can go one at a time and give you our answers again
        - So moving on to question number two it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Yes. What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Awesome. So we're going to look at the second question, and the question just to reiterate, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - So we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon.
        - We need to make - when we are given a question, remember the question that you guys all answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. Remember answering that question?
        - Okay, so, STUDENT, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you guys had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, I think I got this all figured out. So now I'm all good.
        - So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific. Right. What did they use to discover
        - so First, I see a STUDENT could you share what your answer was please am the evidence.
        - So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - That's right. So let's look at our passage and see what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Now you actually gave me the results of it, but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon alright so so.
        - Good, thank you. I see that you guys have just answered your question your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon. Yes. STUDENT
        - Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - What is the question. The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable. Right.
        - A scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon. The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay.
        - Yes, thank you, but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon, and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I was just. excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - um so I know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and STUDENT.
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay STUDENT It says, NASA send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Excellent so i'm going to ask the question, one more time. What equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon?
        - All right, so let's talk about the question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Everybody gave a different answer.
        - What do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon. Okay.
        - So, yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment, 
        - All right. Okay. The question was we read our story. And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon. Right?
        - So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon.
        - Let's do STUDENT, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Of you guys are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - What I have a question for you, what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Okay, let's talk about the questions. One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon.
        - So what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon.
        - OK, so the stuff about investigate that makes sense.
        - Do you want to go first then STUDENT about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Um, yeah. So I kind of know all about space already like, I don't think I need to even in this
        - So let's look back at our question. It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question.
        - So does anyone know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon.
        - So I'll read the question again for you guys but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So, STUDENT, do you want to start with the question what equipment. It's scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright, so our question is,
        - How did you get that answer.
        - When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - And I think that's super cool. But the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon. .
        - Awesome. Well guys, I've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Mm-hmm. So how about we move on to the second question. Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - So I just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon. 
        - Oh no, that's okay. I was more of a comment. Really, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I have to be on this group, cuz like I kind of already know all about space.
        - Okay. So was there any other equipment that we used.
        - Okay, thank you. Okay, good. Good to see everybody. Okay, so I asked you what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Let's, let's go over some of your responses here, 
        - Was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Right. But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh yeah okay i'm so sorry I know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first, so I just said, I circled all the same thing, instead of repeating.
        - and let's look at the question. The question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon, right?
        - i'm.
        - um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay.
        - get them on.
        - Right, who heard in that story what they use. What was the name of that scientific tool.
        - and our question again was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?
        - So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, please, can you please read the question again.
        - I guess, I was just gonna say that I, I I don't think that I need to be in that group, because I don't think I need any help because I already don't our space.
        - yeah I I understand. Okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - Circle evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - each of you individually, which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, and is STUDENT pointed out, oh sorry about STUDENT yes.
        - Yeah, I think you're saying like that. Yeah. So I know a lot of equipment, but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water. So I was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water
        - But I'm going to reread the question for myself and for the class what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Excuse me, excuse me. This is STUDENT. Um, I shouldn't be, and this group, I already know all about space.
        - All right, I appreciate it. Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Today we are going to look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright, so we are going I had asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - Awesome, thank you STUDENT. Um so first, I just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick.
        - All right, you guys. So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Yes. STUDENT
        - So going back to the question right which so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So going over that.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.
        - So do you think it would be
        - Okay, thank you very much. Okay. And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon.
        - So coming back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Okay. When we read that question. What are some words. And let's do
        - All right, so STUDENT, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Alright, so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - well I guess it's a lunar orbiter um
        - let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Absolutely. This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - Yeah, there is a question. The question is, what equipment, the scientists use discover water on the moon. 
        - So do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Good job. So we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon. 
        - So what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon
        - Yes, we do.
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that
        - Responses to your questions, or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Go ahead. STUDENT What's your question.
        - Awesome. So we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon. And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - OK. So we're going to discuss the next question. And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does anybody have any thoughts on that?
        - So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But let's look at a question. Again, the question is asked, What equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon. 
        - All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with STUDENT oh STUDENT you have a question.
        - I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Okay, was anyone able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon.
        - Yeah. 
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon. What equipment. Did they use to discover that water.
        - The question is, there is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon. And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text.
        - STUDENT, I see your hand everybody take a look what word, do you see inside of the word polar.
        - So going back to answer our question.
        - Well, I had said that they could do it with the craters. I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so can we look back in the text. I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
        - What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon. 
        - ok now so hello. You, the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes STUDENT.
        - Alright, so Hello everyone and, as you all know, we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon, is a desert, and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT.
        - Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water. So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Keep in mind the question is, what did scientists use to discover water on the moon. After talking about the word investigate discover and look closely, what do we think the final answer is? what equipment did scientists use? so for this one i'm going to call on STUDENT.
        - Did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Gotcha. Okay. That makes a lot of sense.
        - we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but the question was asking what equipment.
        - Okay yeah I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.
        - Why don't you start with what it, what. Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon.
        - So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon.
        - So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used STUDENT.
        - Miss STUDENT I saw that your hand was raised, what, what kind of toll or equipment. Did they use
        - Hold on just one second. Okay. The question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon. Okay. So, STUDENT.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. OK. So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon. What do you think they sent
        - I got my answer.
        - Of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - yeah I said NASA sent a small machine.
        - I went to NASA.
        - At the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about.
        - So the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And we talked about equipment we have, like you said, the tablets and pencils. But what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - answering this question, or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon
        - Good. So now if we look at your answer to our question. Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And you said, NASA sent a small machine.
        - Alright, so go, I am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon.
        - Okay, so it says we're entering question. One question one is about the equipment. Okay.
        - So the question is also asking um what equipment, do they use to discover water on the moon 
        - So I'm going to start with this question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money.
        - Okay, so where did they send this machine to.
        - And STUDENT, you can you please read the question again?
        - Okay, so now what does it say that they sent. What did they send to investigate.
        - Well, in a lot of ways that's right Okay, because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, so it would be cool to to if you went home and told your mom and dad about this story then to know what they used right so that's where the question is coming from because what if your parents asked you, what did they use. And that's what this question here is asking, what did they use
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the
        - Scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - Excuse me. I don't think I should be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - um well um okay well um I guess it's um I didn't circle anything in the reading um, but I just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon, I know they need oxygen tanks 100%.
        - What equipment is used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Can you help me figure out what tools that scientists needed to find water on the moon. Can you tell me one of those items.
        - What equipment is scientist you discover water on the moon. 
        - Orbiter.
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - And the question. So two questions. The two questions that will, one of the questions that we had is what equipment did scientists you to discover water on the moon.
        - know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable.
        - for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what did you guys think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. Um, so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh gosh, remind me. Other questions, man.
        - Mhmm yeah.
        - Okay, yeah, yeah. Oh, I see that I see.
        - If you guys have your text handy. I would use it
        - Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says, STUDENT, yes, STUDENT?
        - Sure. Okay. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Should I keep reading.
        - Oh yeah, sure. Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Let's see, STUDENT. Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two.
        - yeah, I would like to because this is where I found my answer it says.
        - um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again.
        - Okay. So could I have someone. Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read. Question number one out loud for us.
        - They I guess they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it.
        - let's all take a look at that part of paragraph two, there, right at the beginning NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh yeah I could I could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right.
        - Okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yes, those are great equipment words. OK. Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those STUDENT, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine.
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.  Okay.
        - That means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth.
        - Excuse me on i'm so sorry I really don't want to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and.
        - but anyone read it out to the whole class. STUDENT, could you please read it, for us, the first sentence.
        - The question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Sure. Okay. It says, oh, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading. And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us.
        - Oh Okay, so can you keep going and read the next sentence.
        - And it can you continue for the next two sentences.
        - In in writing those responses, so what I want everybody to do is I want you to read the question, one more time Okay, we oh STUDENT you have a question go ahead.
        - yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So STUDENT said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text STUDENT, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead.
        - I think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read.
        - Oh. I'll read. Can I read?
        - Yeah, okay. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have
        - For the third call it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic Microsoft
        - And I want to challenge, just like STUDENT, take a look at that question. Can you read the question for me.
        - Oh yeah it says, or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon.
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three. Look at paragraph three
        - It says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater 
        - STUDENT can We go to paragraph two,
        - Good now let's look at the second paragraph together NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - So if you look at paragraph number three. And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three. I'm going to read it. You follow along. Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth. The water they found is, what's the word there?
        - The water or identified the water so let's all go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds, maybe 30 seconds.
        - Okay, I'm
        - See if you look straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater. These deposits are very small.
        - yeah so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use.
        - Of work. This would hold only 32 ounces of water.
        - is actually showing the text but STUDENT I want you to read the question more closely. So what does the question ask us?
        - I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so STUDENT. Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer.
        - But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, STUDENT
        - Yeah, you're welcome.
        - Can you read the sentence before that STUDENT.
        - It says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater. Okay.
        - So let's look back at
        - Yeah, we all have it on our tablets.
        - Let's look at the third paragraph. Does anyone want to read that for me.
        - So paragraph three. Who would like to read three?
        - Okay, so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - yeah I want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says.
        - Um, okay. So should I should do the part that I circled
        - Well, that's fantastic. How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it.
        - Paragraph two. 
        - Okay, so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.
        - Okay, um paragraph two
        - Okay, so, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I'll read it. I'll read it. Ok. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh, so it says this Lunar Orbiter. Will look for deposits.
        - I will, I will just be about, like, I was wondering if this was maybe the answer is NASA use a small machine to get to the water. This is that a good answer.
        - Okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon, so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - In paragraph number two. The first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface.
        - Exactly, so what I want everybody to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together.
        - So, let's go back up the text has one, two, and three. So in looking at the one, two, and three, they're short little sentences.
        - Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, now I'm going to stop there.
        - All right, STUDENT, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one
        - Go back to the text and look
        - Gotcha. You need a scientific
        - Like Oh, they want me to study the surface and don't know.
        - All right, who would like to read the first part there.
        - that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more.
        - Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas
        - I'll we know NASA has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small. 
        - Want me to read, read, where I got my answer from or you want me to read where STUDENT got her answer from?
        - That you're on the right path right, and so I want you to do the same thing as STUDENT just looked at that text because again.
        - It says NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay, thank you for responding STUDENT so i'm wants to go back and I think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so STUDENT, if you can look at the third paragraph and I want you to just, would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph STUDENT?
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Can you look back in the text and see
        - Okay, so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind. I'm going to read you this paragraph. Okay.
        - Can you read paragraph two for me.
        - circle, the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question.
        - So why don't you read that question for me again.
        - What does it say on paragraph three, about the microscope um can anyone start reading with the sentence that says, the second sentence and paragraph three STUDENT.
        - All right, go ahead and look backward in the text, what about the rest of us.
        - And then also I would like you. We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question. So can you read back the question for me.
        - Microscopic's kind of like really small.
        - And the next part of the question.
        - The lunar orbiter, in paragraph twol
        - But in that first paragraph. it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon. STUDENT
        - Okay. Um, let's see.
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle.
        - My answer came from paragraph two. I still don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Totally, so we're going back to the question, so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon, 
        - yeah definitely definitely agree, so the universe is so mysterious, and there is very large space for us to explore. So um, do you know what is our question for today?
        - go right ahead.
        - Can you read the sentence that you found that in. I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence.
        - Okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud, for me, can you do that.
        - Can you reread the question to me.
        - yeah you got it Okay, that means that the moon Estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - All right, you all gave such great responses to this question now, I just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it, and if you could just follow along yes STUDENT.
        - yeah thanks STUDENT go ahead and read paragraph one for us.
        - And then also I want STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT will you guys look at the fourth paragraph and then STUDENT and STUDENT will you guys look at the bottom, the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph?
        - NASA send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters. Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage. Can you look at your passage with me.
        - mm hmm so let me read that part, the first part, or part two together so NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways. Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Yeah okay. What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two, can you can can STUDENT use that paragraph two, can you read it out loud for us.
        - Um, yeah, okay. So question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water. Water is heavy. And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - and specifically what is the sentence say.
        - yeah well Actually, I have a comment it's that I, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - It says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And STUDENT. Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        - question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon.
        -  but STUDENT can you read the question for us, do you have it.
        -  Everybody look back with us and STUDENT read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine.
        - Says the orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2.
        - In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah
        - Now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can anyone read for me the question that we need to answer.
        - Oh, interesting. Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out
        - Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - Let's look back at the text. Okay. Okay.
        - Okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon. Okay, so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon. 
        - and STUDENT can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again. 
        - um yeah excuse me.
        - Alright, so let's read the question, what does the question say
        - Let's move on to the last one. That means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on Earth. 
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways.
        - Um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you guys in your groups you guys can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay.
        - Okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so STUDENT, would you go ahead and read the question to us.
        - so to keep going around STUDENT, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one.
        - There is paragraph two, could you go ahead and look at paragraph two
        - All right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?
        - We can read super fast, so we we did our two minutes.
        - All right. Well, let's look at it together.
        - yeah that is that is 100% correct, but can I have somebody read question one out loud for us again.
        - Very small.
        - Okay, so that number two we just read, read
        - Yeah. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - there's a little bit more keep reading.
        - Look at that question again.
        - Oh yeah, I can do that.
        - awesome great yeah we does everyone see in the first sentence and paragraph two, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods.
        - under paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning. It wouldn't be able to see
        - yeah Okay, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So, in, in paragraph two, what does paragraph two say?
        - So if we read, question number in the first response. So scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters. These creators are dark places where the sun never shines 
        - In the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time. The moon is a desert. But if you go to the second paragraph, and the very first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I'm gonna stop you there. We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        - So we are going to look back in our passage. So I will everybody to get back into their passage
        - All right. Can I get STUDENT to read the question for us, please.
        - Excellent STUDENT could you read the second paragraph, for us.
        - And so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were, if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, yeah. So um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay, awesome. So we're going to move down to paragraph number three. Can you all find paragraph number three.
        - These ice deposits are very small. And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth.
        - Let's look at Paragraph two, where NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - Water on the moon, I want us to take a look, though back at the question that was being asked and I want us to think about oh yes STUDENT.
        - Yes, just take a second and reread it.
        - Well, I was just when you say I wasn't sure why.
        - Yeah, the one starts with that the final sentence there. My apologies. Oh.
        - OK. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth.
        - Great response. So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, STUDENT.
        - Okay, let's see.
        - Yes, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - All right, so, STUDENT, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading. Can you do that for me?
        - um excuse me.
        - Sorry to interrupt Mr Teacher. But I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later. Okay.
        - What's that say
        - Okay, all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay.
        - But we look back at the question for me. STUDENT It will you read the question back to me.
        - Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so
        - Huh. Yes, it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - STUDENT. What was your answer.
        - Well, I. It's meet STUDENT here, I just want to say that I don't understand why my answer's wrong.
        - So let's jump back into it I. Does anyone remember what the prompt was last week.
        - So let's go back to STUDENT. And I think, STUDENT . You also had a similar answer to STUDENT.
        - Yeah, so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment, like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - So my my answer was that I thought that they use, they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so I believe that they use the microscope to find the water.
        - STUDENT Do you have a question.
        - STUDENT go ahead. 
        - So that we can answer. Yes, ma'am.
        - um STUDENT let's talk about your answer a little bit.
        - Um, so I was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon.
        - Um, okay. So I was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready.
        - Water is valuable. We've got to drink it all the time. So yeah, based on the article, I would say, yeah, water on the moon is valuable.
        - yeah I definitely want to go soon, so what pieces of equipment, did you talk about in your answer STUDENT.
        - While you're thinking, I'm going to answer, guys. My question, what did you need STUDENT, what was your question.
        - Oh, it wasn't a question. It's just that I found the rest of the sentence.
        - How about you, STUDENT. All right.
        - so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon.
        - STUDENT How are you doing, because I know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well.
        - All right, so, STUDENT. Do you want to share first
        - I'll start. So I said that  In terms of what it meant it. Scientists us to discover water.
        - awesome STUDENT go ahead.
        - Okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths, where it was like, not for a long time because it said, making this plan will take a lot of time and money.
        - All right, so what did we decide was the most important word in that question. Somebody raise your hand.
        - yeah I said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - yeah i'm I circled the same as STUDENT.
        - Okay and STUDENT, isn't that what you mentioned? You'd need a scientific tool called a what?
        - Sounds good. Okay, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close.
        - All right. Um, and then STUDENT. Did you get the chance to revise yours?
        - Why don't we go around the table so STUDENT, you can start and then it will be STUDENT on STUDENT and so on.
        - STUDENT, maybe?
        - STUDENT, do you have a question.
        - Okay, well, I put the Lunar orbiter and then I added that to what I said about the microscope So then, I have two names of equipment and I have looking really closely, which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right.
        - STUDENT I want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon, do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon.
        - Let's start with STUDENT, would you mind reading your answer to me.
        - A lunar orbiter. STUDENT kind of touched on that in her answer.
        - yeah so I said water can be split up into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - STUDENT and STUDENT how's it going as far as you're looking through the text.
        - Well, I said that, um, you know, that they could use. Um, maybe that's uh
        - I said they could drink it.
        - I'm ready, I'm ready to go.
        - Oh, so I think it's the microscope. 
        - Um, yeah, yeah, I can talk about my answer. Um, so my answer is I'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay, STUDENT. Can you tell me what your answer was
        - STUDENT, what about you.
        - yeah yes STUDENT, you want to add to that.
        - Thank you for that understanding today so STUDENT, I'd like to hear your response.
        - Okay, STUDENT. Can you tell me
        - STUDENT. Can you tell me what you what you thought.
        - Miss STUDENT, what do you think
        - so STUDENT can you remind me of your answer yes STUDENT.
        - STUDENT Let's uh, let's start with you for a second. So for equipment from the passage. The moon is a desert.
        - Yeah um I circled the last sentence. It's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three
        - When you have an example, raise your hand. STUDENT What's your example.
        - STUDENT. What did you say
        - Alright so STUDENT. Can you remind me of your answer.
        - Any ideas about how they might detect water on, from the orbiter?
        - Hmm, okay. Now that I've seen a picture of it. Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water. Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it. And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it.
        - Thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact I didn't know that does anyone else, want to try working through their response or strengthening it.
        - Okay, so, can you tell me.
        - STUDENT. Go ahead.
        - Alright, so STUDENT now it's your turn, can you remind me what your answer was for the question number one.
        - Yeah, I was this, I said yes.
        - yeah okay so um I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen.
        - If ice. It was ice.
        - Was I was just asking.
        - I do have a question. Yes. So I'm not sure I agree with STUDENT, because what I'm thinking is, if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope, then how can you find it if you can't even see it.
        - Um, yeah, like there's a few things that I should are that I've learned from like I learned that, like, Well, like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that.
        - yeah sure I said i'm that you'd need, let me look, I think I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover STUDENT why don't we hear from you first.
        - So who would like to share what their response was to that question, STUDENT.
        - Okay awesome um who would like to share what they found would anyone like to go first.
        - Good. How about you, STUDENT.
        - Okay Well, this is so, I changed my answer so first I said the microscope like STUDENT did, but now now, I think, maybe they were just saying that it's really small so.
        - Can we start with your answer. STUDENT
        - Well he's reading that. What was your answer.
        - hi so STUDENT, can you tell me a little bit about your answer.
        - So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question.
        - So let's see STUDENT what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So with that in mind, who can tell me what are the two tools that we need
        - Um, yeah. Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess. I think I got this all figured out. So I think I'm all good. 
        - Oh perfect what's your answer okay.
        - Well Would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like?
        - I said that all scientists know I said, you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely.
        - Thank you. Hi, STUDENT. You have a question for me.
        - Yeah, okay. I said, ah, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh, could you STUDENT could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in Part two
        - I guess like I went to NASA. And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right.
        - I said yes. And I said, the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water.
        - Right. STUDENT What's another use
        - STUDENT, do you have anything you want to add
        - STUDENT. Would you remind me what you were saying, just so we can catch back up.
        - So STUDENT, you told me you circled the same answer as STUDENT. Can you remind me which part you and STUDENT circled again?
        - STUDENT  go for it 
        - Excuse me, teacher, I shouldn't be. Ms. Great. I already know all about space.
        - All right, well, you do that Deb STUDENT and STUDENT Do you have a question.
        - So, okay, be what I was looking at
        - Sure. My answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yeah, I said that NASA found a small machine. And that's the same thing. STUDENT just said.
        - STUDENT STUDENT What did you want to ask first,
        - What do you have any other suggestions.
        - So finally miss STUDENT. Do you want to share your revised answer
        - yeah absolutely so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you and I in particular, I really wanted to thank you for working with us.
        - Yes, STUDENT go ahead and say it.
        - So who thinks they can answer that question now what evidence, would you circle.
        - My example as water can be broken down into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Um, STUDENT what was your answer to this one.
        - So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you
        - STUDENT have a different tool that he found
        - Okay, well, I circled two is that okay.
        - I know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay.
        - Sure.
        - Ah, I said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks.
        - Oh. STUDENT, did you discuss your observation with STUDENT do you guys have an answer?
        - So does anyone. Does anyone want to volunteer in a response to that question. I have any ideas about that.
        - What's your idea, STUDENT?
        - OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - You just said it does know what was your answer.
        - Alright, so we're STUDENT, do your best. Let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you. Okay, STUDENT. What was your answer?
        - STUDENT. I did see that you put you answered the same as STUDENT. So in your words. Can you tell me how you would answer that question.
        - Okay, well, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - STUDENT would you like to share?
        - STUDENT what was your answer to that question.
        - Yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter. Maybe they use a microscope. Who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks. 
        - All right, can you just remind me of your answer.
        - Well I can share. 
        - All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you.
        - STUDENT, do you remember the name
        - Yeah, okay. So I said, water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore.
        - and can you go ahead and remind me, what did you respond.
        - Well, I was saying that the scientists would have to use like I'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that I already know before like ever doing the reading.
        - STUDENT. Can your group. Tell me what you What your reflection was
        - STUDENT
        - Okay, go ahead STUDENT.
        - What did you say in your your response.
        - So let's see what STUDENT has to say.
        - How did you answer the question again?
        - STUDENT.
        - um yeah well, I suppose same thing as STUDENT.
        - And STUDENT. Were you getting the same things as STUDENT since you're working together.
        - Go ahead. 
        - So I said, like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need, like, all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space.
        - and so STUDENT did that help you answer the question, what was your answer.
        - Well, let me just review, do you want to share something
        - one more word that someone wrote down for discover anyone have another idea here.
        - And then, when you guys are done, I would love for STUDENT, I want you to tell us a little bit about what you found in the fourth paragraph that made you think that water having water on the moon can be beneficial or valuable and then
        - STUDENT? 
        - STUDENT, you have a question.
        - Awesome, great STUDENT. So I first want to start with STUDENT. STUDENT Could you read, you me your answer
        - Okay, so I think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon, and they used to think. There wasn't any but now they know because they found it.
        - Does someone to have a response, they might want to share with the group.
        - Alright, so now STUDENT, can you tell me what you answered what you said.
        - Well, why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote. Alright, sounds like a plan?
        - Share with us your answer.
        - Ya so I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine.
        - Would anyone like to share
        - So how about STUDENT, could you actually read what you wrote?
        - So who wants. Why don't we start with STUDENT. Could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer.
        - Go ahead.
        - Yeah STUDENT give it a try.
        - Anybody want to--
        - All right, STUDENT, and what was your answer to the discussion question.
        - STUDENT.
        - No, I was done. 
        - So can you give me something different?
        - Okay. I think the most important word is equipment.
        - but who would like to raise their hand and answer is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - yeah so basically what I said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close.
        - yeah so now i'm a little confused because I guess well, I thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe STUDENT is correct, so is she right or am I right.
        - You want to say something about the text STUDENT?
        - So STUDENT what do you have
        - awesome so you corrected your answer so we'll take you as a volunteer to go first.
        - You're right, STUDENT. So what did you say for your answer?
        - What did you circle, STUDENT.
        - Um, let me see. But I did want you to. I just want to remind you, my dad is an astronaut.
        - and STUDENT, could you please tell us?
        - Does anybody have any thoughts?
        - So we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon. So STUDENT can you remind me what your answer was? what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Absolutely. Very good, thank you. And so what was your response to this.
        - so I said microscope, but I'm not quite sure. Like why is my answer wrong.
        - Oh, this actually does anyone want to start and share their opinion again allowed
        - Well I, I wanted. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        -  STUDENT, would you be able to share with us, which you were able to locate.
        - Okay, so what's your answer?
        - Okay, so can you tell me your answer again.
        - What was your answer. Sorry.
        - so STUDENT, could you repeat your answer for us, please.
        - Okay, do you want to go first.
        - Okay, what did you figure out.
        - yeah yeah. Okay, so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so STUDENT was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and I think that STUDENT 's right.
        - Okay, so now let's look at your statement.
        - So what was your answer to the question, what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - STUDENT What did you circle.
        - Wonderful. STUDENT?
        - Okay, mine has the equipment, but not the second part.
        - Okay well um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.

- intent: r130
  examples: |
        - Oh, so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place.
        - yeah that's part of it, but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right?
        - Absolutely. They do. You're absolutely right. So a lot of equipment is huge. But what we have to do.
        -  So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine
        - It's not that it was the wrong answer. It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question. Did you look at discover
        - But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope.
        - So you're partially right when you kind of say that the
        - Yeah. Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was
        - Yeah, because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it. Like, like what
        - Okay, gotcha.
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but. Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit.
        - Well, it's not completely wrong.
        - Okay, okay, um,
        - Right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right.
        - You say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water. Right. And yes, you're right. There is there is a part of the equipment. 
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track. 
        - But it's important that we add that we have both things. And if you want it bad microscope, you can. 
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA sent a small machine, you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um.
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope.
        - Oh, that's really interesting. I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a
        - So I think the three that we've identified so far, all together, will will lead us to a great answer and I think, specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text STUDENT do you want to say something.
        - Let's talk about it, STUDENT. So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's. 
        - So, STUDENT and STUDENT also found different paragraphs. So there are multiple answers.
        - So next time. It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you guys are highlighting the right answers in the passage
        - but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand.
        - yeah so that's what we're going to find out, right now, so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer, so we got part of it right, but we want to get the whole thing OK.
        - Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there. 
        - yeah that makes sense.
        -  And because STUDENT just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this. And so, Hey STUDENT I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct.
        - Okay, so I just have to add more at the name and stuff to it.
        - For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks.
        - So that's good. You thought through that. It wasn't a bad answer. It just wasn't correct for that question. 
        - is something you would use to find water on the moon.
        - Okay scientist, or I can see a better one.
        - Oh um that could be it. 
        - Um, yeah, I could try to see like
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct. 
        - Okay, STUDENT and STUDENT, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely.
        - Yes, I know what you mean. They use the microscope to look closely at the water. 
        - Well, okay. So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in. So, that is correct. 
        - Really close. I'm sure you do. 
        - I think that might answer another question of how can they see the water.
        - I just think that I could see a little bit more room for improvement. So
        - So that's like, okay, you know, but I want your question your answer to be spectacular. 
        - Okay, so there is another tool in there.
        - They're looking for the water
        - I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden.
        - I think that is a great response, but I know that you could go even one step.
        - STUDENT. That was really, really good. We're almost exactly where we want to be. We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there. But we're so close now. So thank you for your
        - wide range, you could have multiple answers like how STUDENT said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes STUDENT.
        - Oh that is obviously a true statement. Right. You can't live without water. 
        -  and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research.
        - Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger.
        - You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water
        - Yeah, I think you're right. I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different
        - yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer.
        - STUDENT, you started off your response really well.
        - so STUDENT. Your answer was correct.
        - Okay, you want to have reread it
        - They do us all a lot of tools like that.
        - yeah well sort of about that I went to NASA so I know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Your answer is not wrong, but it's not totally right, either. 
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon. If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon. 
        - Okay. And that would be that would be correct. There's definitely no oxygen in space, 
        - You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. Um, so yeah, it makes sense that they would need other equipment too.
        - ya it's on my tablet
        - Okay, great. Okay, so let's reread over the text because STUDENT and STUDENT are really close to the answer.
        - yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call, but I wanted to say, thanks for asking asking everybody about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea, so you know I felt valued.
        - Well microscope is definitely equipment, but it's not used in space, like, because we
        - A better word?
        - Oh, okay, I need to look for that because I thought a microscope and that's pretty important.
        - Well, you're right. They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it.
        - But what I really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like I said when STUDENT we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe.
        - So STUDENT. You're right. You need a scientific tool called the microscope. That's right. You're right. We also need
        - Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - So in essence. Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space. They need to breathe. Right.
        - All right, STUDENT you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start
        - Right. Okay, good. So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it. 
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there. Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence.
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope. 
        - Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - STUDENT says that NASA sent a small machine. And that was right too. But that was not enough for that question. They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question.
        - And I think that with all of her answers. We're all getting on the right track.
        - Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points. everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again.
        - Right. So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples. 
        - They did. And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like STUDENT said
        - Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time.
        - But I can do that.
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more. So if we put STUDENT 's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer.
        - Actually I think it's partially right
        - Alright, so we've got the Lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment 
        - Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon.
        - I want to take a look even closer STUDENT. There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified. But they didn't use that to specifically find the water. 
        - Okay, good. So that's a good start on your answer.
        - What I just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important, 
        - Yeah. Okay, that makes more sense. Okay.
        - Yeah, okay. So looking at your responses. I will say this, STUDENT. You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response. 
        - So STUDENT your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had.
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close.
        - No, no. So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet. So you're absolutely right. 
        - you're right STUDENT when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right.
        - Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine. That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was.
        - So now we have two pieces of equipment right, so we have the Lunar orbiter that STUDENT talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response 
        - So again, that's true. I can tell you read part of the text. That's true. And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water.
        - So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so.
        - I'm I'm mostly focused. Well I guess. Yeah, I thought about discover just like STUDENT I circled equipment and water.
        - I agree what STUDENT.
        - OK, so the microscope. Is it wrong, but we've answered one part of the question. So now we want to. It says, what other what tools. So we found one tool. We want to find the other tool so microscope was correct, but we want to find the other tool also in our story. So even you had said.
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits.
        - Because yes, they would use all of that  but
        - Yes. And that is very true. They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for
        - Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect. 
        - Yeah, sure. Okay. And STUDENT you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks, 
        - That's a great place to start as and thank you. 
        - And STUDENT, you said NASA sense a small machine. Okay, and you know it you're actually correct. But
        - Um, yes. So, um,
        - Awesome. Okay. So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon. If it were astronauts on the moon. Right.
        - Okay, great so that's almost there I think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the Lunar orbiter and then, if we put that together with savannas answer.
        - And STUDENT, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water.
        - Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe. You're right.
        - STUDENT you are um you are on the right track, you do mention the microscope 
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope.
        - Wow, that's a great start. STUDENT, so it does
        - um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better.
        - know your background knowledge is correct, but he's not the answer, or the way that I would have where did the answer.
        - Oh, yeah. So, okay, I should actually, I had a question, because I circled.
        - So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon 
        - One second STUDENT, I will get right back to you, and they use a microscope they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate, so there was a couple of different things, yes, STUDENT?
        - let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that, but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. Those are some great observations. Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use. But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - That's not entirely true. But they did find water in some of those places. 
        - So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators. So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it. STUDENT, just something you'd like to add
        - There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so.
        - What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope.
        - Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question.
        - Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water.
        - um yeah well i'm still not totally sure, because I know me and STUDENT we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small, how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya.
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead 
        - Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment.
        - So I was gonna say us with the machine was and I was gonna say the machine is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Your answer is not wrong, actually, but it could be even better. 
        - All right, now STUDENT, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right
        - exactly right, and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because, by the way, that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon, however, the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze STUDENT what's up.
        - So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter. That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for.
        - Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that STUDENT and STUDENT and STUDENT talked about to discover the water.
        - It is semi right. You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter.
        - yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that, like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one.
        - They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that. 
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment.
        - Yes. So that is one part of the one part of the answer. 
        - Oh OK.
        - Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there.
        - Okay, okay. Yeah.
        - will be super microscope and STUDENT set the Lunar orbiter.
        - mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a, we could get close, we could get an answer that's more specific right? Okay, so I wouldn't say it's wrong all right, I think you're on the right track for sure. Great job, STUDENT. 
        - You did. You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks. 
        - So basically what I looked at what's up. Well, actually, I guess I didn't really circle. Well, no, I looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water.
        - And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,
        - So we need to, there's two parts of this answer. So we need to combine what STUDENT set. And her answer with what STUDENT said in her answer, there's two parts.
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this. However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon. 
        - yeah I saw in paragraph two, there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon.
        - That is true, but it's not fully insured 
        - So you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water, but then, in order to see the water they use a microscope.
        - That NASA sent a small machine. It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space. Does that make sense?
        - That's good. They do need that. 
        - Sure. I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon. I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon. So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard.
        - If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment.
        - So STUDENT. You are right, they, they set that small machine. And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        - Which is right, we all know, that's a known fact.
        - yeah exactly Okay, so what i'm hearing from you guys now is, we have two different tools that are really important in this 
        - We are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine, 
        - Can you tell me what equipment they use so STUDENT and STUDENT, you're not completely wrong. A microscope is a piece of equipment. But that's not the full answer.
        - um I also read that there could be a base on the moon by.
        - You're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon. But that's when they
        - When they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there.
        - So you were right in that it was a small machine. So great job. STUDENT,
        - So you both had part of the answer you said, to put it together.
        - Um, you know, I think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel , that I think it's convincing that they have, like, you know what they talk about with whay you can do, yeah I think it's convincing. 
        - I don't know. You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots
        - but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water
        - I can read the question if you want me to
        - But let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related I think you're all on a really good path, but we're not quite there yet.
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong. You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - um so well, I guess, I would change my answer to.
        - Was not with that microscope.
        - You do? Well STUDENT I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text.
        - so that the machine necessary is the Lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope So these are two parts of the answer to the question.
        - And the scientific tool. So I think you we're on the right track.
        - so STUDENT you have one part and STUDENT had the other part, and we need to add it together.
        - They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading.
        - The microscope is a tool that they use. But I think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use.
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope. So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer. Um, so yeah, good job.
        - STUDENT had a good start on his too 
        - Oh, your answer is not wrong. They did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use.
        - Not completely wrong. It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - Not what they wear.
        - yeah Okay, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - I actually have a question. I still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong.
        - Okay, so STUDENT the machine is called a lunar orbiter, and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth, can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take.
        - I was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong, and when I looked at it. So the word that I circled I circled keywords in the question. I circled equipment, and then discover, then I looked at the text, I also circled, in paragraph two, investigate. 
        - Let's see if we can figure it out because STUDENT had the same answer is you. So let's talk with STUDENT and see if we can work together on that one. 
        - Okay, well let's ask your other classmates. 
        - Not really, but that's a good guess. STUDENT, what do you got?
        - um, yeah that makes sense, but it didn't really say that in the story, so I don't think I would have known that if STUDENT didn't tell me.
        - So let's break it up into groups STUDENT and STUDENT if you will be a group of two AND THEN STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT
        - Is there somebody STUDENT, would you like to help her out.
        - let's see if STUDENT has anything different to say 
        - Yes, that's a very good point as well. STUDENT and can someone remind me. Do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon. Does anyone remember
        - Well, to find the water NASA send a small machine.
        - So what I'm going to ask you all to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner. And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers. So you're going to share each other's answers.
        - Well, me and depth kind of set the same stuff. We said that you know the Microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four, they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to
        - Maybe
        - So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates. Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can
        - Do you agree with her thinking, Do you disagree with her thinking why oh
        - I would agree. What do you all think? Do you think that that strengthens STUDENT 's answer?
        - Okay that's a great question. Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to STUDENT's question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can STUDENT support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter. Okay STUDENT What do you think?
        - I said that that's the scientists NASA center small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Did anybody else use a strategy, similar to STUDENT or differently to STUDENT, and how did it help them or how did it. Yeah. How did that help them to do this work, STUDENT.
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, STUDENT, and I appreciate your feedback. But what was the microscope attached to? Help STUDENT out.
        - I was pretty good, let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel, you said breathing.
        - Okay, it's me, STUDENT, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore.
        - I mean, I think it might be cool to go to space. But I feel like if we make it too easy to go to space. And that'll make it too easy for everybody on earth to just, you know, like
        - We also use it in science class to
        -  Okay, so does anyone else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now, what do I think after the conversation.
        - Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story. And so I didn't see the pardon about paragraph two, about the ice cuz I was looking for the word water.
        - STUDENT, is it okay if STUDENT helps you out this question?
        - I think, oh,
        - Um yeah I I thought water was the important word
        - Oh, I think it takes, can someone find it.
        - uh huh
        - Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know. I think that STUDENT 's guess is pretty good. Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?
        -  Does anyone else have an answer that they would like to contribute.
        - and STUDENT, you can help out too.
        - Maybe someone else could offer something yeah STUDENT.
        - yeah great STUDENT STUDENT do you have any thoughts I know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic, do you have any comments to share on top of the STUDENT, because you can add on to this.
        - Do we agree with her answer.
        - Evidence. Thank you. Does anybody agree with STUDENT about evidence or does somebody have a different idea.
        - Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too.
        - Okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay.
        - I picked out equipment and discover too.
        - Does anyone agree or disagree with STUDENT
        - Um, I can do it. I can do it. I'm
        - yeah, I guess, so I I think like I read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know, like I don't know like It made me think that this is something that could make that possible.
        - That STUDENT didn't say, how about STUDENT. What did. What did what equipment and I use
        - um STUDENT, you have your hand raised earlier, do you want to maybe add on to what STUDENT and STUDENT have shared so far.
        - yeah I do.
        - No does anyone can answer the how much water they found.
        - Did you all hear what I said to STUDENT?
        - So I believe they use the microscope because you, you said that we should look at the text. So why I believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see, and then the text. It's like saying that the waters microscopic so like I think that's it.
        - Okay. STUDENT and STUDENT are Looking back, and they're thinking about STUDENT 's answer. I would like for the four of you, and STUDENT can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with.
        - STUDENT and you want to build on that?
        - Very good, very good. Um, so can you go, or can you turn and asked help from a friend.
        - Does anybody want to add some more detail. STUDENT, thank you for raising your hand.
        - Oh, it must be. It must be STUDENT.
        - So, STUDENT and Deb, you talk together STUDENT and STUDENT, you talk and then STUDENT You can you can talk with me.
        - Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?
        - It means to go around.
        - Yes, had to be from the craters, the craters for the water
        - Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing. I basically like my dad took me to NASA. And when we went to NASA. We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like STUDENT was talking about. 
        - STUDENT you started out the same answer as STUDENT, do you agree with what you said you want to add on?
        - Anybody else find any other piece of equipment.
        - Does the rest talk with STUDENT about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter. I think you have the answer. So, talk with STUDENT and help him discover which one it is.
        - Okay, we can do that.
        - And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right.
        - Well, what do other people think does anyone else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope Is it the Lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah STUDENT.
        - Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment.
        - Perfect. Awesome. How about STUDENT and STUDENT. You guys look at that together. Okay.
        - I had an idea. But I don't remember--
        - I want- before we get into that I want anyone else to share any other equipment they may have circled.
        - and let's see class. Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement. They found craters full of water on the moon.
        - And then STUDENT. How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out STUDENT and STUDENT to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right.
        - yeah does anybody know when they use it, based on the text we can look in part three.
        - And then, as a group, we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote, you can vote amongst each other, what do you think the correct answer is, and, as a group, you can decide, and let me know.
        - Discover
        - yeah that's fair does anybody have have some input for STUDENT as to why the small machine is also important STUDENT.
        - Think about what's STUDENT said.
        - Yeah yeah cuz that that was the same. I had circle too STUDENT. I had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Because they were looking at the water. And that's what the question is asking.
        - On not not about this, no, I was gonna say that I was gonna say I asked my new answer is ok
        - Does anyone agree with STUDENT. If you agree can raise your hand. And if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text 
        - So how to do that STUDENT either you can answer, or maybe STUDENT or STUDENT could help you out with that.
        - that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did anyone else have any other ideas.
        - Who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and I think STUDENT you also answered the same as STUDENT, so why don't you the three STUDENT, STUDENT and STUDENT have a quick chat with each other.
        - Well, I think you're thinking could benefit everybody else and how you just does everybody. Does anybody else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right.
        - Does anybody remember?
        - I wonder, maybe STUDENT can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer.
        -  can anybody or STUDENT. Can you tell me
        - Um, yeah. Yeah, that'd be great because you know if I have to carry water might my arms and be tired.
        - Oh well, Okay, I said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - STUDENT and STUDENT can the three of you chat for a minute and share, about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then STUDENT and STUDENT can you do that as well.
        - Group members, while the first person is sharing
        - Okay, so, and STUDENT did you agree with STUDENT.
        - Okay STUDENT are you able to help?
        - that's that's really good answer, I agree with STUDENT about that, but I just I just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch, right now, but I really wanted to say, we really appreciate how you really took your time and.
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead STUDENT.
        - Yeah, I got this. It's called
        - Is there anything else they'd need to find that water.
        - Oh, okay. So, based on what STUDENT just read about a lunar orbiter.
        - Does anyone else have any other ideas about what equipment is.
        - Awesome. What about STUDENT, what do you think about that.
        - STUDENT, you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now.
        - Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for STUDENT?
        - So did anybody say like a title?
        - Is it the one that I said that we were just talking about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - While I was just gonna say like, I know that like scientists use a lot of, you know, equipment, so like I said oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - Good good STUDENT you want to build off that.
        - Does anyone have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment. Yeah, STUDENT. Go ahead.
        - Yeah. So basically, um, I think that, well, it sounds like the microscope like
        - who can raise their hand and what isn't it. 
        - Well, I mean that's The only other equipment that they have in the story is the Lunar orbiter.
        - STUDENT. Do you want to answer. STUDENT 's question.
        - About STUDENT 's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people.
        - Yes, I see.
        - Okay, STUDENT. Do you agree. Also, do you have something else to say.
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from STUDENT, and why you found what you found. And then why your elbow partner agrees with you.
        - Oh, OK. I can see why you think that, but I don't see it that way. Does anyone else have an idea, why do we all have different answers.
        - Awesome. Does anyone else have a different response than STUDENT.
        - I know that food is pretty gross I want to bring you into Congress and you should with STUDENT because STUDENT raised a good point in his
        - and at the same time I want, i'm wondering, is there any one else have different answers?
        - Yeah, so I went to NASA. And I saw that the scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that.
        - Or anyone else find anything different?
        - And then eighth and you can share your answer with me. I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that.
        - Right good good anyone have a different answer.
        - So do you guys agree that that can be very valuable.
        - So what do you think about this STUDENT
        - STUDENT, would you agree with what STUDENT said?
        - Oh well.
        - Does anybody want to-- STUDENT, do you want some help from a friend?
        - Yes. So investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth.
        - About STUDENT can you read yours, and then we can maybe like a grief, we wanted to add something to it, or maybe take something away Okay, so I.
        - Alright, so what I would like us to do next is STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT I would like to group with you together and STUDENT and STUDENT, we're gonna work together. Okay.
        - nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used. Does that make sense.
        - And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes.
        - Oh yeah I saw that one.
        - Okay. Well, I guess I gotta look in paragraph two
        - STUDENT What do you think, do you agree with death.
        - This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes STUDENT.
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water.  You can drink it and do other stuff, right?
        - Um, now I mean, maybe they used it, but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it. But, um, I think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important. Okay.
        - and actually STUDENT had a good point and his answer STUDENT, if you want to share.
        - OK Can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and NASA use.
        - So who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist.
        - Um, yeah.
        - STUDENT, Do you want to try to help her out to
        - Now, now you guys have not, but you guys were so close. So have Mr STUDENT and history. STUDENT out death.
        - Well i mean i i support. What's the microscope. Cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story.
        - they didn't?
        - Um, okay. So basically, my thinking.
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together. Let's work together to see if we can find this answer. Okay.
        - or actually STUDENT um, do you agree with STUDENT that.
        - STUDENT and STUDENT I want you to partner up and do the same and STUDENT, you and I are going to spend some time together and be partners for today 
        - What do you think about that, STUDENT?
        - Um okay so
        - You agree with that.
        - Ok, all, what do you see.
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out.
        - So i'm STUDENT do you want to talk first.
        - Can anyone help him? 
        - Would anybody else like to add on STUDENT STUDENT or STUDENT to the first question.
        - What does everyone else think.
        - um yeah I mean I kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that I noticed was that.
        - Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope. I think that it's the machine. The Lunar Orbiter. And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does.
        - What does everyone else think do they agree with what STUDENT said.
        - Does anyone remember.
        - awesome why don't you talk with STUDENT and you guys can figure out if that.
        - Okay, so let's continue to look maybe STUDENT can help you out. 
        - Still don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - How about STUDENT and STUDENT show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well. Okay.
        - do you agree with STUDENT do you want to add anything or take anything away from it all.
        - um yes, I I thought, something different, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        -  what else how are they traveling to the moon.
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think STUDENT. What might help your friend.
        - I circled two. I circled small machine and Lunar Orbiter.
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - Debbie will be the second STUDENT, you'll be the third STUDENT forth and then STUDENT last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer. So, STUDENT, if you will go first. And then, STUDENT. I'll tell you when when to start
        - My answer was.
        - Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for
        - Yeah, I would have to say, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and STUDENT work together since you were you had the same answer. 
        - I think so um let me see.
        - By using what you and Mr STUDENT and Mr STUDENT, you can talk to. STUDENT and see how good your response and STUDENT just wanted to work together to help astronauts.
        - STUDENT, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used.
        - Awesome. So you're going to share what you found with STUDENT and I'm going to work with STUDENT independently, STUDENT you have a question. Okay.
        - Okay equipment for discovering water.
        - Yeah, I do.
        - Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um,
        - Yeah, um
        - Um sure. Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right. I'm a little confused about why
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?
        - um, what do you, what do you all think.
        -  but STUDENT what else, are you going to add?
        - Perfect, yeah. And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover
        - together.
        - STUDENT I think you talked about a small machine, do you want to add anything here.
        - So let's hop back to STUDENT for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question.
        - um yeah well now that I understand um yeah uh yeah I do.
        - They use the equipment. which is the lunar orbiter. STUDENT, what's up?
        - it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water. 
        - um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes STUDENT 
        - So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question. Does that make sense.
        - The lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny. You can't even see it. You had to use a microscope.
        - I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well.
        - Yeah. So first they had to find it. And then they could investigate using the microscope.
        - Right, there were two. So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water. Yes, STUDENT?
        - And then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet, but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water
        - And they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome, 
        - but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter.
        - And that's what actually finds the water
        - Right, and so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water. Now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water.
        - Okay, let me see.
        -  Yeah. So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future. It can be valuable. 
        - you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well.
        -  So my answer---
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that should have been your answer.
        - You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope. They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh, but I guess. So how do you figure that out. Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,
        - but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, STUDENT was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father.
        - Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer. But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use.
        - It is. But they didn't use it to discover the water.
        - Yeah, OK.
        - The truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water. 
        - That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely. But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time. 
        - that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second STUDENT I wanted to talk about STUDENT 's note STUDENT 's answer on the oxygen tanks. Totally right
        - That's how you got to know that there's water on it.
        - So if we look in the reading. We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that's another tool.
        - So you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely STUDENT.
        - fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah STUDENT.
        - equipment that they used
        - But we also need STUDENT 's part of the answer that. How did they even get the water down here. They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it.
        - A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use
        - Okay, so you just needed to see
        - So you might have circled water as well.
        - that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water.
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it. They had to use a microscope.
        -  but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign.
        - The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery, can you see that now, and the response.
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think of how the heck
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water. Okay.
        - Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon.
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter.
        - Simply corrects without engaging the student (e.g., "The right answer is actually…")
        - Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff. So they didn't need that stuff.
        - But if we were to choose one answer to be correct. I would probably go with the lunar orbit. 
        - Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for.
        - yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful.
        - yeah Okay, I see that right there.
        - It would take a long time. But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use, 
        - Oh, okay, well, okay, now I know the answer.
        - Yes. And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water.
        - So how did they find the water
        - Right. Yes. And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely.
        - So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture. And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter. OK? 
        - yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter.
        - Well, I'm glad you brought that up. Well, in our story in the moon is a desert. It doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon, so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today.
        - Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay 
        - um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - And actually, the water would be valuable in the future.
        - Okay, yes. Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing.
        - But I just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter. So that should have been the answer that we wrote down
        - Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer.
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope.
        - Can I just say it like how you said? A lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon.
        - And so in this case case. In this case, the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter. 
        - NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead.
        - Oh, wow, ok. 
        - They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water. 
        - Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water.
        - Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water.
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that. Right. They sent the lunar orbiter up
        - But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water. 
        - Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter.
        - To investigate right.
        - And so I just had to say lunar orbiter?
        - And it went. So instead, it it checked for water on the moon.
        - yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink.
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - Like STUDENT, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter.
        - Oh OK OK, I understand okay.
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - And that's what they helped find water 
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it.
        - Mr. Teacher?
        - they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter. 
        - new findings.
        - And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon. That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it.
        - Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it. And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one. That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water.
        - So when we write our answer.
        - Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it.
        - So they did use a microscope, but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon. 
        - Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture.
        - So as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text. You can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished.
        - yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like.
        - about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon.
        - um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits, but the microscope you need to look at the deposits.
        -  so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water. 
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose. 
        - And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon.
        - Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water. Of what that they found so they would add that. So the answer, like a complete answer that I'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon.
        - so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two, I saw that I found a lunar lunar orbiter.
        - Um, but it's a small machine that's called Old Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,
        - So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article.
        - uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three.
        - But there's other ways to detect it. So in this case, they didn't. It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope. 
        - So they use the Lunar Orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it.
        - The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate. 
        - is to travel around the moon and discover.
        - And um I also noticed, you know STUDENT like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find.
        - That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope 
        - And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Close. I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there. 
        - and they didn't use oxygen tanks, although they do use them. They did not use them to find the water on the moon.
        - yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose.
        - Okay. Um, can I try again. Can I do another answer.
        - into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable 
        - awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does.
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon.
        - It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Things like the microscope.
        - So yeah.
        - Yeah. So though small machine was named the Lunar Orbiter. That was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface.
        - No.
        - So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink. 
        - Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater.
        - No. They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water.
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen.
        - The lunar orbiter was the machine that NASA sent to investigate to look for ice deposits
        - and on paragraph two, you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water, 
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry.
        - I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?
        - Oh so just have to add the name in there too.
        -  they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right 
        -  they have a satellite go up right to do all of this.
        - That has a microscope.
        - Okay. All right. Now I should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like I guess I could what STUDENT said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter.
        - Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?
        - Teacher and I don't mean to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening. So like you, STUDENT. You explained that they sent a small machine. But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - On I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say.
        - Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes STUDENT.
        - and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water.
        - they put the microsope 
        - we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh well, I had a different piece of equipment, I said the microscope and.
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as STUDENT, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        - So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too.
        - And for this particular reading The biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover. 
        - You say, both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it.
        - So is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right?
        - Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small.
        -  Alright, so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water, but then the, the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope. 
        - And that is the name. It's not capitalized like your name, STUDENT 's capitalized, STUDENT is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not. But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer. they're looking for. 
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water. 
        - and the ice deposits. That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        - So there's actually two answers 
        - looks for ice deposits. Right. So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - I don't understand because it says, Oh, what did they use to discover the water. And so, in paragraph two, they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits, and we we learned in science class that ice and water, are the same thing. Ice is just frozen water right?
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Oh, OK. So it's both.
        - Yes. Okay. See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable. And the reason that I said that. So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water.
        - So even though this astronauts went up there. Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them. 
        - Mm hmm. Yes. And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope. Right?
        - But with this specific question the answer that. is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter. That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water. 
        -  So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it.
        - And that's how we discover discover
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter. Okay.
        - Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon.
        - um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic
        - We actually do have water and craters here on earth 
        - That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer. I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource 
        - Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - That is the equipment that they used. All right.
        - Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine. The Lunar orbiter.
        - They didn't really use a microscope to find the water. The water was located underneath the ground.
        - yeah that wasn't the story.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way I know all I need to know.
        - But the last passage has our answer in it. 
        - The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful.
 
- intent: r140
  examples: |
        - but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?
        - Oh yeah, definitely.
        - Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you guys read? 
        - that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part.
        - I think they said the really dark.
        - The water is hiding in the craters.
        - Awesome. Well, since you've gone there. Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there.
        - Um like different than a microscope?
        - I'm walking. Yeah. Yeah. Like in science class, we look at like these little bitty. Um, oh, I don't remember the names of it, but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny, teeny thing.
        - Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space STUDENT.
        - 'm i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um That was a really helpful way, to put it Thank you so much.
        -   and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o.
        - um okay I don't know exactly, but I think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know, like.
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at
        - Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?
        - Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer.
        - Mhmm.
        - Oh well, space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe? we don't even know. We just know we have our planet and we have the Milky Way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there.
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        - Yeah yeah we talk on Skype all the time.
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new. That's it. That's a really good reason to be reading current news.
        - i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if.
        - Great STUDENT can you teach us the Spanish word for moon.
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see STUDENT.
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on.
        - Oh well, i'm actually I was gonna say I looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that.
        - Okay, okay, I think.
        - OK, cool.
        - That is pretty cool fiction. But if you look back in the older books from the past, a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen, and with science, we have brought it about. We are able to do a lot of things. Like back in the 1930s-- is that a long time ago?
        - No way STUDENT that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon.
        - it's amazing, you can see, all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years.
        - it's something we can like lune
        - Oh. Oh. Well that's a good question. But I was gonna say first, just real quick because I went to NASA.
        - that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024.
        - STUDENT have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?
        - OK. Is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story?
        - would anyone ever want to go to space.
        - yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you guys responded to which was.
        - STUDENT. What about you, would you want to or would you not
        - We plant cells in science class.
        - I mean, I think aliens are kind of cool. So yes, I'd be down to learn about that.
        - Yeah, so, um, one on are playing a video game when I use my Xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool.
        - Okay, how about how about.
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something. I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that. That that's really cool. That's really cool. Yeah.
        - Yeah, oh yeah, me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits. It was the coolest ever
        - Well, they're microscopic aliens that live in the very, very cold, because it's really, really cold on the moon. On that moon, it's like 200 below zero. So it's really cold there. But they think that with their equipment, like what they had on the moon that was-- that they used to find the water on the moon, they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on Titan.
        - You're a really good teacher. 
        - Yeah, me either. I think that's what the scientists thought too.
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about, 
        - me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to NASA so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon, and then what their plans are in the future.
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy. Was it fun?
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F. Kennedy center, or--
        - Um, yeah, I sort of knew
        - And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh.
        - I yeah he works at that that's Dennis Space Center. I'm in Mississippi, and he kind of like commute, so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like.
        - detectives.
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there. STUDENT or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article.
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game. Right. So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them.
        - um yeah I mean that'd be pretty cool you know, and then I could just kind of look down at earth and I can be like hey everybody down there i'm just chilling up here, even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do.
        - Oh well, I don't think I never really thought about that before, like maybe there is water on the moon, maybe around the moon. I wasn't really, I never really thought about it, I guess.
        - No. I didn't know anything about the Saturn stuff and the moons and, like, teeny-weeny aliens. That's like, wow. I mean, that is pretty cool stuff. I didn't know that.
        - You are correct. I went to NASA as well. When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment.
        - OK? Do you have anything else? Do you have any interest in that, STUDENT, about the aliens on the moon of Saturn?
        - um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this room, because I already know all about space.
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month. Does that make sense?
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space.
        - So they're full of water at the bottom?
        - Is there anymore knowledge you guys have. Yes, STUDENT.
        - Okay yeah I think we learned this, I think we learned this in science, because we learned that water as an H two O, and I know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen.
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know. But right now, you every one of your student at school, right. So what's an equipment you have right now. Thats helping you with your work, STUDENT.
        - yeah I thought it was a really interesting because I didn't actually know that there was water on the moon, before I read this and I thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter.
        - Know do you just like to read about this on your own.
        - Has anyone ever use a microscope before?
        - Yes. Saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it. And there's actually a moon that's called Titan. And they think that they may have found life on it.
        - I guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon.
        - well you could be.
        - Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that STUDENT what were you gonna say.
        - I had a great time there as well.
        - That that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind.
        - Yes, I would say I would say I was surprised.
        - Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?
        - They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the.
        - Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know.
        - yeah and STUDENT like was this the spark any interest in you or yes.
        - how about you, STUDENT. Were you surprised.
        - When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read.
        - do you like like space, do you like to.
        - Yeah, yeah, just like an aunt or something like that.
        - You won't run out of gas. And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station. We're not gonna turn back around, right.
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes.
        - Oh, like organisms.
        - i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah STUDENT.
        - I know. Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think? 
        - Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone.
        - Kind of how I think about it. Um like a refrigerator
        - so STUDENT has as well. Yeah, yeah.
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why STUDENT, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter.
        - I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?
        - This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age 
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact.
        - yeah STUDENT Do you know anything else about the moon.
        - Okay, have you ever used a microscope.
        - OK, I see it says that NASA scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen.
        - Tangential instruction without purposeful connection to question or text
        - You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those.
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close. It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Were you surprised STUDENT, that the scientists found water on the moon.
        - um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it.
        - in science.
        - I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that.
        - that's really cool fact STUDENT, where did you read that.
        - How did everybody like the reading.
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?
        - yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said STUDENT made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so.
        - yeah yes three years away.
        - I definitely want to live on the moon.
        - Well, I didn't go to NASA, but I did, um, I've seen that in box. Yeah.
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr STUDENT on.
        - Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space.
        - Huh. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool.
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert. Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad.
        - I mean i'd like to live on the moon.
        - So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay.
        - OK. Why would-- why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks?
        - Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry STUDENT, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon.
        - I would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth.
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade. I wanted to be an astronaut. So obviously I didn't live up to that. But, you know, that was my goal.
        - Oh man, I know all sorts of stuff. I know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space. It's a vacuum. So you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and I know that like
        - Oh, well I thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah, it's really cool there. I had a great time with my dad.
        - really like space i'm also big fan of space to.
        - yeah me too.
        - yeah well, I have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water?
        - Well i'm a little bit I can try.
        - You like the martian?
        - But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting.
        - Oh, well, that's great. It seems like you learned something today. Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert.
        - Um, okay. So I can say I should ask and drink the water. You can't survive without water, having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft, water is heavy.
        - Is a while you're looking at it. I'm gonna go back to STUDENT because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts. 
        - Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group.
        - wow.
        - Because they can't breathe. The atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here.
        - Yeah, it's a good movie. 
        - Well, or if there's water on the moon.
        - Oh well, okay um I want to look at Jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane, and I really want to look at that.
        - And people thought that was just going to be-- that was science fiction, and that was not realistic. But do we have it today?
        - um well, I mean, I guess, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't want to like you know, like live in a space suit, like all the time, that would be like really uncomfortable.
        - Do you?
        - Well um I just found it surprising that there was water on the moon, I never thought about that, before, so I was very surprised.
        - It was a lot of fun. We got to see a lot of space shuttles, and astronaut, space chutes, and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space.
        - All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay. You're sitting there were at school.
        - Oh, thank you, STUDENT. Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward. STUDENT
        - You know all about space really where did you learn about space. Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum.
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer. Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - jas STUDENT you're not so interested in going to the moon.
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes. Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end.
        - That's really good. Well, it sounds exciting. Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - Oh yeah oh big time I watch all these videos about space on YouTube and and I really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity Chamber oh yeah I really like space.
        - Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think.
        - Yes, yes, we have.
        - So STUDENT did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts.
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space.
        - Oh, LAUGHS
        - Yeah, with my dad. I went to NASA. So I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
        - No, I meant on the story. My teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small group, because we needed more help with our answers. But I told her that I think that I have the right answer.
        - Yeah, yeah. There was stuff in there.
        - Yes, I can share.
        - and Spanish word for me is Luna.
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share.
        - and STUDENT one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon.
        - STUDENT, why do you want to go to the moon.
        - I'm not really into space, so--
        - Yes, yes. My dad, me and my dad went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to--
        - yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different.
        - yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one STUDENT.
        - Well, I don't know a lot about space, but I know that our environment is really bad. And so we might have to live on Mars or something if they keep destroying our Earth.
        - Okay STUDENT do you speak Spanish.
        - So like an ant.
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know. So can you tell me what what do you know about space.
        - Okay, well, I know a lot about space, I know all about the different planets and I know stuff about uhm stars that Milky Way the sun kind of all the all the big ones.
        - Oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there, I can't wait, I really want to go to space camp, because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut, and I want to discover new planets and galaxies too.
        - Um, um, yeah, like on a car.
        - Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just really wanted to thank you for working with us, and in particular.
        - The John F. Kennedy center.
        - Oh, that is so awesome. Has he told you about these kind of thing.
        - That's, I love that answer. Do you like to garden yourself STUDENT.
        - Yeah, he, he talks about it all the time. And like, that's how come I know so much about space.
        - It looks pretty disgusting really.
        - Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish.
        - Oh well, I like to watch a lot of videos like on YouTube. So I look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket. Oh, it's so cool.

- intent: r150
  examples: |
        - Um, well, actually. You might know a lot about space, but we're gonna go over what you guys read in the text. So it might be something that new that you might not know
        - Exactly, so not what they used to look at it. So I wanted to go back. Is there anybody else who wants to share on that and that issue.
        - Does anybody else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left. STUDENT.
        - We've all read the article
        - Okay, yeah.
        - Um, yeah, I think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense. So like STUDENT, you're saying that like basically like that, you know, if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it. You have to find it. First is that right
        - OK, that's great that you know a lot about space, but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about. Being in this group doesn't mean you don't know about it, it just means that I just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought. OK?
        - Yeah, okay. So when I was reading the
        - So I just want to make sure that everyone knows what they're reading and how we can really bring out the best in all of you guys.
        - Right fantastic Okay, so you read the article water on the moon.
        - does that make sense yeah yeah.
        - STUDENT, do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon?
        - um you're right, I did say to expand on your answers um and you know I try to thing everyone's answer can be right, I mean um.
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit. And let's just see where we get. Okay.
        - Thank you for your help. Today, STUDENT, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today.
        - Does that make sense.
        - Understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And each one of you had different answers in your journals.
        - we have a lot of good information. And so, so we've decided and
        - um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay.
        - And whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you.
        - So I I read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024, and it was just making me think like.
        - I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - i'm STUDENT I think that you guys all have it figured out, but I think that if we just look at it a little more in depth, we could just get our answers to that much better 
        - Yeah, I guess that's a few less words. Okay.
        - And that we all can come to a solid answer for the prompt. So you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too. So I'm glad that you're the expert. I appreciate that. Thank you.
        - It's time for the next group. So thank you so much for working with us.
        - It won't be boring trust me it'd be super excited.
        - can we now see why that makes sense.
        - Is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and I wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates.
        - So we're talking about how we just read the moon, is a desert, and I know that, yes, STUDENT.
        - If you understand what I'm saying, please. Nod your head to let me know.
        - Oh, that's okay. It's always fun to be with groups.
        - And look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way.
        - Oh, it was so cool.
        - And if you understand what I'm saying please know that your head to let me know.
        - Yes, so the machine is the Lunar Orbiter, do you agree?
        - So we'll be talking about your responses to the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable um so first of all I your I like your responses all they're all different, and I like that so what's what's taught was start with STUDENT so you're your.
        - hi it's nice to see you all again and I am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon 
        - Them. What did you think
        - Wow, I'm sure you know, tons about space, but we're always open to learning more and more so.
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way. But let's talk about this for just a minute. 
        - No, that makes sense. So like I should just say like in detail, like what it was
        - hi everyone i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small group, so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon. So before we start can we, oh STUDENT, did you have a question.
        - Does anybody else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article.
        - Yeah, of course. And STUDENT, do you have a question?
        - You guys think so?
        - Very good. So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is. 
        - Um, I just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut.
        - Okay guys so now we're going to work on question number two.
        - And i'm going to tell you exactly what I, what I want you to do, and I want you to apply that. You may understand it now, but I still want to tell you my concerns just so you and I are both on the same page.
        - Okay. So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking 
        - Well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all, you always have an open mind to learn more.
        - Does anyone want to add to that anything that they heard while I was reading
        - yeah I think we're ready to go.
        - How about you, STUDENT. Did you read it for me.
        - Does that make sense to everyone.
        - Right. Nice job. All right. Does anyone else have anything they want to add to this discussion, STUDENT. What do you want to add
        - So, are you guys ready to share back with the class.
        - So we answered our last question. So we're going to move on to a new question.
        - So does that make sense. STUDENT, I saw your hand go up. So does that make sense as to why
        -  I just want to make sure that you guys are getting it and I want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so STUDENT are you ready to take your time.
        - because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question.
        -  so could anyone like to have a dialogue about that.
        - I mean, I guess so. Because I don't have a job and so like, so I don't really get, like, you know, for grownups and and how much money they have. Um
        - Okay, are you ready to share what you got what the new partner.
        - I mean that is going to really be helpful. Were you listening when I was talking to STUDENT early earlier.
        - yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.
        - STUDENT STUDENT, and he said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Is that making sense to you. STUDENT as well.
        - Oh well, you know the the greatest minds in the world, always always now I learned something new, every day, so you know you try give it a shot, you know, keep an open mind to it.
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys. Would that be okay?
        - I do, I do, I do. STUDENT is. Yeah. I have a question.
        - Oh yeah oh OK that's fine.
        - Um, maybe I think
        - So today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion.
        - To the text, but I want to talk a little bit about how everyone responded after reading the text and I just want to kind of ask one more time.
        - Or you could use maybe something you found on your own. You don't need to use what you said.
        - Here, because sometimes other people know more about other things than us, we want to make sure that we all hear each other out there STUDENT had a great answer and you just expanded on it, so we all get to work together here, which is awesome.
        - OK, so the Lunar Orbiter. Good job. So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?
        - Okay. Appreciate that answer. STUDENT So maybe we could look at this together. And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        - So STUDENT and STUDENT i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first 
        - awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs.
        - And the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable.
        - Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong, um, cuz I pull mine from the text to
        - yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Okay awesome um so STUDENT do you have any questions about your response.
        - OK, so now, hearing back from all of your responses and everything, they sound amazing, but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text. Yes, STUDENT, I believe.
        - Oh well, you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might.
        -  I actually chose all of you, because I think all of your insights are very valuable and I really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking 
        - maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can all learn from each other how's that sound.
        - Anybody have any questions about that question?
        - i'm still kind of confused 
        - STUDENT any you look a little, little stunned. Is there something I can help you with
        - but let's focus on this test.
        - Does anybody have any questions remaining about that.
        - So cool, you know, lots of books space. Right. Yes. You're going to help us out. Maybe the article can teach you a couple things to that'd be pretty cool expand your knowledge.
        - That you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense.
        - Guys, excuse me.
        - STUDENT, you are very smart. But there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more, OK?
        - Hi guys. So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to all look back to the
        - By water. We're so small they have to use a microscope to see it.
        - yeah yeah I wrote a lot more um I mean I wrote a lot more like not words but you know, like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story.
        - Oh no, not really. I just added more details.
        - um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in all that outside knowledge, because.
        - Um, because I really think that all your thoughts are important. Okay. So because of your, of your opinions are important in their contribution good information for this class.
        - Um, well, actually, our story. It's on our tablet right in front of us, so we can see it there.
        - Okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because I want to talk about your answer after STUDENT 's done., alright sound like a good plan?
        - All right, so I think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts
        - Honestly, not totally like I got back. Maybe they used both, but I don't really see why it's not the microscope.
        - um yeah so I shouldn't be and that's group I already know all about space.
        - About 10 more seconds. Is everybody done reading. 
        - i'm i'm still kind of confused.
        - does that make sense.
        - yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water?
        - Well it's always great to expand your knowledge, because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject.
        - I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident. I want you to well fake it and see what happens. If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction.
        - I'm going to go back over to STUDENT and savannas group. So keep working.
        - Sure do.
        - Um, yeah, that makes sense. So like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope.
        - Okay. And once you run it. You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today.
        - yeah I had that equipment, I said on oxygen tanks, in my answer
        - Sweet.
        - Does that make sense to you all.
        -  And that's what we're doing right now in this class. We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers.
        - In small groups are like first of all to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions.
        - And protective caps on here we go. 
        - We're just going to look deeper into them and kind of, you can explain your thinking to me. So then I can understand better and we can help each other, understand better so that sound good.
        - So I was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water.
        - We're going to talk about our
        - But part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say STUDENT can share, about space that you know that I don't know or that STUDENT doesn't know and vice versa,
        - All right, well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay.
        - Do you need a reminder of what the question was?
        - Alright guys, so we just shared our great answers for the question but I just-
        - What about making is that making more sense to you.
        - You can shake your head, yes or no, if you can.
        - Yeah, I think so. So we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers.
        - And we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - It's not a question. But I was just looking at the clock, and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Well cuz, you said that So the answer was a good answer, but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and I wrote like a lot of words, because you told us to expand our answers but they're different.
        - Well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our class with us.
        - Exactly. That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track. 
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something. 
        - Oh, I don't think I know I don't understand why I'm why it's not the microscope.
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article. But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        - and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you, how does that sound.
        - Nice to meet you too. I understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon. Am I correct you read it already.
        - Yes, those are perfect things to add, um, do you have any other questions before we move on?
        - For our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon 
        - Okay, yeah, sounds good to me.
        - Is everyone done?
        - hey also STUDENT STUDENT and STUDENT have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a group, to see where we're at 
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries
        - Okay, friends, usually in my classes when students agree we go like this, but if you agree. You can raise your hand if you disagree with savannas thoughts and just keep your hand down and we respectfully agree and respectfully disagree. Right.
        - Jump back into the text into what we were doing before. Does anyone remember what we were working on before
        - You understand?
        - Does that make sense. STUDENT?
        - Okay, so let's just start. Okay. So raise your hand if you are ready, read the lecture there. That is cool. The moon is a desert.
        - Yeah, yeah. So believe it or not, we can do close reading in Science right and social studies to find out, we're looking for. 
        - Oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there, like Maybe it was a like a NASA they call it an unmanned pro.
        - i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - So remember, um, I want to listen to all of your thoughts.
        - Cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers. Okay STUDENT Do you have a question.
        - Yeah. Yeah
        - um yeah so I picked I picked something different from STUDENT so i'm wondering, because I said NASA send a small machine and I thought that the small machine seemed really important.
        - so do you have any questions for me on that well.
        - Doing good. Thank you for asking. So you all read a passage about discovering water on the moon. Is that correct,
        - Are there any questions.
        -  how do you feel about that.
        - To all guys. So all of you guys read the text and gave good answers. So to start off, we're gonna start with STUDENT.
        - And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space. So why don't you stick with us and
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn. Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn. That's awesome. That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe, 
        - Oh, that's awesome. So yes, we all revise and corrected our answers. I just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure
        - So even if you know all about space right I think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this group today does that sound okay.
        - That feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you.
        - okay does that sound good.
        - What do you confused about.
        - Excuse me, a teacher. I hadn't been on this group, I already know all about space.
        - awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does anyone have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct.
        - The great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions.
        - I'm glad you liked it. Does anyone want to share anything important that they read
        - Okay, does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense. 
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - Okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that I can assist you with.
        - Absolutely. So do you understand how your answer was right. But we could have made it just a little bit more detail.
        - Well, um, I. It's me STUDENT. I said that they used a small machine that was my answer.
        - does that make sense to STUDENT.
        - So I'm going to give you a minute to go back
        - I just want to make sure that you understand all of what what we just talked about and stuff. And what we read. This is just to help you understand, just a little more
        - Um, I mean, I guess so. I guess.
        - I think so.
        - Oh well, that's really that's helpful, but the reason we're in this group is, I wanted to explore a little more deeply i'm really interested in what you understand about this article overall right and how how the whole process works.
        - um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Right, and no student is wrong. We all have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon.
        - hey you really know what you're talking about, and it also shows that you found your answer from the text. Does that make sense, everyone?
        - I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - love the um does anyone else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for STUDENT house and the STUDENT are you good.
        - So I want to hear all of your ideas.
