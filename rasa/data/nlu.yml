        - that's awesome that's awesome before we get started, I want to ask, if you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group 
        -  Has he told you about these kind of thing
        - Oh, that is so awesome
        -  When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?
        - Okay
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?
        - Yeah
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes
        -  Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end
        - Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?
        - Have you ever seen something through a microscope
        - Yes, what thing that you see
        - That's really good
        -  Well, it sounds exciting
        -  Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - Well science videos, my family
        -  We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,
        -  Um like a refrigerator
        - Kind of how I think about it
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade
        -  I wanted to be an astronaut
        -  But, you know, that was my goal
        -  So obviously I didn't live up to that
        -  Kennedy center, or--
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F
        -  Was it fun?
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy
        -  I'm gonna go back to STUDENT because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts
        - Is a while you're looking at it
        - but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?
        - Has anyone ever use a microscope before?
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        -  Invite me
        - To the next time
        -  What do you say,
        - How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft
        -  Right
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game
        -  So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at
        - Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories
        -  You're sitting there were at school
        - All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know
        -  So what's an equipment you have right now
        -  Thats helping you with your work, STUDENT
        -  But right now, you every one of your student at school, right
        - And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets
        -  Now, just like when they did their research
        - You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing
        - So did you enjoy reading the passage
        -  I don't want you to write down what all you know about space
        -  Okay
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        -  I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let STUDENT, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space
        -  Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space
        - Alright, so let's go over
        -  It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close
        - Yeah, like a magnifying glass
        -  How many of you have ever seen a microscope
        - All right, so STUDENT
        -  Where did you see a microscope at
        -  What do you want me to tell me about space STUDENT?
        -  Good
        - Oh you already know a lot about space
        - You are correct
        -  When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment
        -  I went to NASA as well
        - I had a great time there as well
        -  Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert
        -  Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert
        -  It seems like you learned something today
        - Oh, well, that's great
        - Isn't
        -  Tell me what you know about space
        - There's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others
        -  But if you read it
        -  Where do you read it up
        - Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible
        -  That's super cool
        -  Anything could happen
        -  Yes
        -  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening
        -  So I mean, at this point in time and this year
        - Possibly
        -  So give me some examples of tools
        -  Debbie had your hand raised
        -  Can you give me an example of a tool
        - A tool
        -  Is there anybody else that wanted to share a tool
        -  That's absolutely right
        - Yeah, absolutely
        -  What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip
        -  So if you drive very far
        -  You are right, think about like a gas station
        - They wouldn't get stranded
        -  And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station
        - You won't run out of gas
        -  And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station
        -  We're not gonna turn back around, right
        - We'll just get more gas and keep going
        - Do you?
        -  Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer
        - Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher
        - So like an ant
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes
        - Oh, like organisms
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr STUDENTon
        -  We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O
        - Okay, so where we left off
        - Yes
        -  Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope
        -  Yes, you do
        - what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?
        - Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not
        - that's really cool fact STUDENT, where did you read that
        - Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,
        - How did they get to the moon
        -  Well, since you've gone there
        -  Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there
        - Awesome
        -  That that's really cool
        -  Yeah
        -  I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that
        -  That's really cool
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something
        - Does everybody here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Is there anymore knowledge you guys have
        - You went to NASA? Really?
        - Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so STUDENT has as well
        -  Yeah, yeah
        - would anyone ever want to go to space
        - And experience this
        - STUDENT
        -  What about you, would you want to or would you not
        - The water is hiding in the craters
        - Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time
        - So you like to read
        -  Do you like to garden yourself STUDENT
        - That's, I love that answer
        - You know all about space really where did you learn about space
        -  Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum
        - Person
        -  Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older
        -  You are so passionate about space
        -  How is everyone doing please raise your hand
        - Good afternoon, everyone
        - Oh, thank you, STUDENT
        -  STUDENT
        -  Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward
        - That's pretty amazing
        -  STUDENT I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So can you tell me what what do you know about space
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know
        - I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base
        - STUDENT
        -  Go ahead
        -  I like that shirt I have the same shirt
        -  Actually, that's a really cool shirt
        -  I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters
        - I agree
        - But we never think about how it would be to actually exist
        -  There are walk around on the moon
        -  So I agree with you
        -  I think that's a really cool thing
        - Were you surprised STUDENT, that the scientists found water on the moon
        -  I think that's what the scientists thought too
        - Yeah, me either
        - how about you, STUDENT
        -  Were you surprised
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  Were you surprised
        -  That's a really good reason to be reading current news
        -  That's it
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me
        -  I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night
        -  Me too
        - Yeah
        -  I thought this was great
        -  Me too
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there
        -  STUDENT or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article
        - So STUDENT did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts
        - yeah and STUDENT like was this the spark any interest in you or yes
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on
        - awesome thanks STUDENT okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday
        - STUDENT, why do you want to go to the moon
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone
        - Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know
        - yeah so in Spanish it's Luna
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why STUDENT, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact
        - yeah STUDENT Do you know anything else about the moon
        - What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity
        - No way STUDENT that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see STUDENT
        - that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible
        - what's your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - STUDENT, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?
        - Oh, what kind of stuff did you see
        - Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon
        - Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer
        - Oh, what do you know about space
        - STUDENT could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?
        - Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish
        - STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Okay STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Great STUDENT can you teach us the Spanish word for moon
        - STUDENT have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?
        - Is space something you're interested in STUDENT?
        - and STUDENT one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon
        - Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space
        - Okay, have you ever used a microscope
        - When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read
        - Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group
        - um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it
        - But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting
        - buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah STUDENT do you have something to add?
        - Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you guys responded to which was
        - that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part
        - Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space
        - Did you guys like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?
        - Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?
        - I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?
        - Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you guys read?
        - Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?
        - I know
        -  Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think?
        - i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah STUDENT
        - You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those
        - This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age
        - yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different
        - Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know
        - um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know
        - yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like
        - Really STUDENT some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use
        - Oh that's cool STUDENT what about you Where would you go what planning, would you
        - and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o
        - Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that
        - Right you all drink water every day right
        - So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay
        - Know do you just like to read about this on your own
        - do you like like space, do you like to
        - no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right
        - So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?
        - wow
        - Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry STUDENT, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon
        - yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon
        - that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024
        - Based on our reading
        - i'm STUDENT do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?
        - Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that STUDENT what were you gonna say
        - i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if
        - I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or
        - And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh
        - He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think
        - Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space
        -  STUDENT knows this, correct
        - This is all true
        - jas STUDENT you're not so interested in going to the moon
        - I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that
        -  STUDENT, why are you interested in going to the moon
        - Those are really beautiful ideas, thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - Oh wow that's really interesting, are you really passionate about space
        - That seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration Maybe you can after we have our small group discussion tell us some interesting facts
        - Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day
        - I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment
        - yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said STUDENT made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so
        - but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that STUDENT
        - well you could be
        - Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space
        - really like space i'm also big fan of space to
        - Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned
        - They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the
        - yeah isn't that cool
- intent: r110.3
  examples: |
        - that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in
        - i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge
        - yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to NASA that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and I think you and STUDENT probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing
        - Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group STUDENT
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn
        - um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question
        - Well, that would be awesome
        -  I didn't know that you taught me something
        -  So I'm glad you're here with us
        - You don't think you should be in this group
        -  Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered
        -  So STUDENT Can you help me understand
        - I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space
        - Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know
        -  Okay
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way
        - You know all about space?
        - STUDENT, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them
        -  Oh, nice
        -  Thumbs up
        -  I love that you know about oxygen
        -  That's awesome
        - For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks
        - I'm sure they do and I bet that STUDENT could probably tell you more and you can share that information together
        - STUDENT, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about
        -  So I know that you can really help us out here
        - And I know that you know a lot about space
        - And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there
        -  So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better
        - You do
        -  That's wonderful
        -  Does that sound okay
        -  Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently
        - Wonderful how
        -  What a fun experience
        -  That's a great connection
        -  How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that
        - Yeah, that's great
        -  We need you in here to help help us out
        - Oh well, STUDENT, and that's exactly why we need you in here
        -  Okay, thank you for that
        -  STUDENT Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this group today since you know a lot about space
        - Awesome
        - Now, STUDENT, our science expert
        - Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing
        - Oh, you were there
        -  Maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there
        - That is really cool
        - Wow, that seems really awesome
        -  That's why you know a lot about space
        - STUDENT your dad is an astronaut
        - That's good
        -  So maybe today or in another class, you can share something that you have learned from your dad
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class
        -  You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share
        -  Well, even
        -  So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it
        -  Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about
        - Good
        -  I'm happy to hear that
        -  It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,
        - That's very exciting
        - That's incredibly exciting
        -  I would hope that that's the case
        -  And with water here that could help us in our future exploration
        -  We're very excited to see that
        -  I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge
        -  We know that STUDENT did visit NASA
        - That's awesome
        -  You can help me out with the other kids
        -  How about that once you just chill out for a minute
        -  What you have STUDENT is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic
        -  That's great
        - Okay so awesome
        -  STUDENT
        - Awesome so STUDENT used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome
        - Awesome STUDENT, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage
        -  So, and STUDENT was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment
        -  Yes
        - Awesome
        -  Can we all agree on that
        -  So what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies
        - And STUDENT, that's really cool
        - Well, maybe you can help the others
        - It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading
        -  And so that's a great thing to share with the class
        -  And so STUDENT when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them
        -  Does anyone else have an experience that similar?
        - Good
        -  Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help
        -  So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it
        -  Or maybe you could see if your classmates
        - Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions
        - Okay, that would be great
        -  Thanks for for helping us out
        - Or maybe you could help us out
        -  What do you think
        -  So we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more
        - Well, just like last time you had something to contribute to the group
        - and you'll be able to share all your knowledge
        - Good
        -  Right?
        -  And I'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you
        -  So we are going to listen to our friends
        -  Okay, thank you for your input
        -  But every time we learn something we continue growing and learning
        - STUDENT You use very good background information
        -  We know that you know about space
        - Okay, we are going to use your
        -  Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us
        - Background knowledge
        -  Okay
        - With more information about what we're learning
        - Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet
        -  We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us
        - Do you really?
        - Right, STUDENT and that's sort of what Luis said too, right? So that's great that you're using your background knowledge
        -  Awesome
        - OK
        -  Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this group so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better
        -  That's very neat
        -  I bet that was-- I've seen some of this equipment
        - Great
        -  Thank you so much, STUDENT
        -  So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it
        -  Well, we can always learn new things about topics
        - Oh, that's okay
        - Oh well, I really need you to stay in our group and and you can help me with like information and things
        -  Okay
        - You can help you can be my helper
        - Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away
        - That is awesome that you know all the extra stuff
        -  And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your
        - Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - Okay, well, maybe you can help us
        -  Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is
        - Okay
        -  Alright, well I'm glad you know all of that information
        - There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space
        -  Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA
        - That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes
        - Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible
        - So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use
        - Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but
        - maybe you can help your partner's out STUDENT I think you would be a great addition to our group
        -  That you know all about space
        - Oh, well that's really great
        -  Maybe you can add to our conversation
        -  That's, that's awesome
        - But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive
        -  And it will help you
        - I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that
        - Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this group then
        -  Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in
        - That's awesome
        -  But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?
        - That's great that you know that stuff
        - Yes, but you can help some of the other students
        -  So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well
        - You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses
        -  And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay
        - Right, STUDENT, so you'll be able to share some information with us
        -  STUDENT What was something that you said that scientists use
        - Your right and so, STUDENT, said the same thing, right
        - Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space
        -  And no, you are not wrong
        - STUDENT and Luis I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources
        -  And I think that that's awesome
        -  So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this
        - and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge
        - Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material
        - I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today
        -  I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today
        -  That's a good point
        - Okay, so, and STUDENT brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that
        -  Now in school right and we're learning differently
        -  Alright, so let's go back to our question
        - It's different
        -  Some things are different
        -  And you guys have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners
        - Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance
        - Thank you, STUDENT, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work
        - I bet STUDENT could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?
        - That's great, STUDENT
        -  I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        -  You know what you gave me a great idea
        -  Right
        - Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space
        -  It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates
        -  So when we cover more about space
        -  Maybe I'll have you been one of our group leaders
        -  Okay
        - Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward
        - So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts
        -  Okay
        - Okay, so maybe you and STUDENT could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space
        -  Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this group to help the rest of us
        - If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space
        -  And maybe we could learn from each other
        - Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates
        -  That's really cool
        - And that obviously shows your understanding of space
        -  So that's really cool that you have that experience
        - I've never been the NASA
        - Okay, so we read it aloud
        -  Right
        -  You read it for us because you know everything about space already
        - That I love that
        -  I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away
        - But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so
        - I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there
        -  That's super cool
        - Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about
        -  Okay, so
        - And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group
        - For me response
        -  You do know quite a lot
        -  So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here
        - So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too
        - Well, thank you for letting us know STUDENT
        - Hopefully one day, Kevin
        -  Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well
        - So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it
        - Well, I definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more, and even learn a little more yourself
        - And maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates
        - And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon
        - that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that
        - Whoo, that's fabulous
        -  Maybe you can help us understand even more about space
        -  So stay with this group, you might be able to help us
        - And maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students
        -  This might be their first time learning about space
        - Now that could actually help out with this next question
        -  Okay, we'll start over here with STUDENT
        - And needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut
        -  Okay
        -  I'm glad that you know all about space
        -  Maybe you should can share some other things with your friends today while we're talking
        - Well, awesome
        - wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all
        - Classmates said don't know so your background knowledge really does help
        - Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation
        - Thank you, thank you for your answer, and thank you for explaining in case anyone didn't know
        - No worries
        -  So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and STUDENT You may know more about space than everyone else in the group
        -  Well, that's really cool
        -  And the fact that you guys know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect
        - Awesome
        - And they would need those on the moon
        -  And I know you said you know a lot about space
        -  So that is a very good response
        -  STUDENT
        -  I also just want to make sure, similar to STUDENT I know that you guys have lots of knowledge about space and
        - Yeah, they definitely do use all of that equipment and that is a great answer
        - yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use
        - yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic
        -  I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class
        - Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that
        -  I bet not everyone has
        - Nice job, STUDENT
        - Absolutely good job way to think outside of the text
        - all right awesome job STUDENT I like that you didn't
        - have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used
        - And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA
        -  Awesome
        -  Maybe I might have to go there soon
        -  I went to NASA
        - That's super cool
        -  I wish, I wish
        -  Yeah
        - Because we'd love to have you here, your expertise could help us all as well okay okay so um we'll start off with
        - So you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good, of how you know
        -  And you know what an oxygen tank is and you know all the equipment they use
        - Some final words like oxygen
        - See you already have some background knowledge on this
        - So you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for
        -  I like what you guys came up with
        - but you guys have some background knowledge and it's really good
        -  That really helps us build on what we're learning
        - That's really cool
        -  STUDENT, I want to thank you for sharing your personal experience with us
        - So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things
        -  So you've seen that they can use a lot of things
        -  And like you said you know a lot about space
        -  Okay
        -  So the more we continue reading about it, the more we can learn about it
        - and also if we continue our readings outside of class, we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space
        - that's a really good connection, so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there, thank you for adding that
        - Yeah, that's great background knowledge to bring to the table
        - That's awesome
        -  So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future,
        - We're looking for something to find it, but that as a good point, thank you for sharing
        - and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space
        - No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job
        - that's really cool I appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact
        - You probably do know a lot about space
        - That's really good that you know all those things, STUDENT
        -  It's really interesting
        -  Those are really good things to know
        - yeah that's awesome and um hopefully you can bring some of that knowledge into today's lesson i'm excited about that
        - I know you know all about space I'm, I'm sure you all know a lot about space
        - Well, that's awesome
        -  So I think you should stay with us
        -  Now you can help the rest of your friends, learn about space too
        - Okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already, but I think you should stay, so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates
        -  Does that sound okay?
        - Well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space, but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too
        - Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space
        - right they do so you, it seems like everyone in this group has a lot of background information about space, which is great, so you probably, when reading this article, connected a lot to it which is really great, but when we looked at the text, it said
        - Right I love that you have some background information on that STUDENT that's great
        - It's great that you have background knowledge, though
        - Right, so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that, and you can use that background knowledge
        -  What do you think?
        - Oh, maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it
        -  Thank you for saying the exact names
        -  Yeah
        -  And I love hearing what you've experienced
        - That's good
        -  Well, that's exactly what I'm looking for, because you've been to NASA, you know all about it, but I haven't
        -  So I think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our group
        - Well, you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of I might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with
        -  So that's really cool
        -  Thank you for sharing
        - That's really cool
        -  And I'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell
        -  And maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit, we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places, like maybe STUDENT's read other books about space, and you've been to NASA
        - And that's OK, sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper
        -  And maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit
        - You'd be a really great resource for us
        -  So why don't you hang tight
        - i'm so glad that you know a lot about space, but I think you staying in our group would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good
        - yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard
        - Do you know what since you know so much about space when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know
        -  But I need
        - Well, honestly, I think that you could be a great resource for your group members and you could help them, maybe like come up with our own answers, or maybe tell them what you think to
        - uh huh oh that's cool yeah
        -  That's really cool
        - Well, I love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to NASA before
        -  But it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions
        - Okay, so we're going to work on that
        - That would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have all this knowledge about it now because we read about it
        - You're right, they do use a lot of different equipment
        - But - And I really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this
        -  Because like you said you know a lot about space
        - But I think STUDENT by you being here, you can use - your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing, because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment
        - yeah, so I think you're right like because you went to NASA you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know
        - that's a really, really cool that's really interesting, I wonder, if it will happen, maybe it won't
        - Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important
        -  So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know
        - And you could help us to understand better
        - Yeah, great
        -  I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge
        - that's very good that you have all this like information in your head, so I feel like well I don't know about the rest of the class, but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so
        -  That's great that you have that background knowledge
        -  I mean, that's great
        -  I think that's really, really important
        - Yeah
        -  I really appreciate you adding that to the conversation
        - So did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew?
        -  So you can share your answers with the rest of the class because maybe someone might not know as well as you do
        - Think it's good
        - and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text
        -  So that's a very good observation
        - I mean, obviously you need oxygen to survive
        -  Space is so cool and I'm so glad that it's a passion of yours
        - That's awesome
        - They do
        -  They use all of that
        -  That's really great
        -  So that's what we would call background knowledge
        -  That's stuff that you know before even reading the article, and that's really awesome
        - You know all about space, STUDENT?
        - Oh that's very cool STUDENT
        -  And thinking about the other equipment that they might use
        -  You're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us, you're thinking outside of the box
        - Right, so you really are thinking outside of the box
        -  Yeah
        - Well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new
        -  Thank you for sharing that though
        -  You never know
        -  That you know all about space
        -  So you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article
        - That's awesome
        - You do know a lot about space
        -  I hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon
        - I'm sure it is
        - I can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer
        - but you can certainly help even with your background knowledge
        -  STUDENT I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon
        - That's really awesome
        - Well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the group, so you might find some use there
        - Good I will, I am glad that you're able to think about another experience that helps you relate to the text
        - but I am so glad that you are passionate about this subject that's going to help us
        -  You know so much in your brain about space
        - STUDENT You're totally right
        -  You definitely have knowledge on this subject
        - So, STUDENT
        - But I think that background knowledge that you have inside your brain is going to be a huge help
        - So STUDENT, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses
        - Yeah, that's great
        -  Maybe you can help your other classmates in if they have any questions they may ask you
        - It's okay?
        -  Okay
        -  So maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge
        - Great it look like you're an expert in our group
        - Wow, great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our group, so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding, or all the things they want to know, okay?
        - Teacher : Right, so I don't disagree that you can learn a lot from YouTube, have boats, the scientists and astronauts and rockets
        - Teacher : Right
        -  So that's really cool that you've been to NASA and you have all this background knowledge
        -  That's all really interesting information STUDENT
        - That's right
        - I know I'm sure you do
        -  I know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books
        -  I'm sure see movies or tv shows
        - Oh, awesome
        -  Well, then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go
        - Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information
        - Oh wow, that's so cool STUDENT
        -  How, what it does to look for the water
        -  Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks
        - Great
        -  You do know so many different pieces of equipment that NASA uses
        -  So, you, you, you're right
        - Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question
        - Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome STUDENT,
        - Wow, to know all about space, you must know a lot
        - Maybe that you can teach the rest of us about
        - So interesting, maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer
        - Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space
        - Because those are things that we might not know, but because you have that experience with NASA you're able to share that with us and I really appreciate it
        - STUDENT I think it's awesome that you know so much about space and I really appreciate you sharing that with me,
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right
        -  STUDENT
        -  We all seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um
        -  Thank you for sharing with us
        -  I really appreciate you sharing that with me
        - Wow that's so cool
        - Well, thank you for sharing that i'm really glad that you have all of this background knowledge already, and maybe you can help others in our group today
        - wow that's awesome I love that you have that background knowledge
        - Already, so maybe you can teach us
        -  You can tell us about it
        -  Okay
        -  Well, you're right
        - Yeah
        -  STUDENT and I really value that you have knowledge about this topic
        -  Okay
        - Yeah I know but maybe you can help us
        -  OK
        - You can give us more information
        - Yeah, um, it's definitely good that you have that understanding and that you're confident in your knowledge about space
        - Well, thank you, STUDENT, that will definitely help our conversation
        -  So thanks again for work
        - Well, that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know
        -  So you can help, help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too
        - Well, you know, that's I'm glad you reiterate that, again, STUDENT, because since you're the expert, we may be coming back to you
        - To help us with some information that might not even be in the text
        -  So you might be able to help us add some additional info but
- intent: r150.1
  examples: |
        - So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right? All right
        - Does that sound okay
        - Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah STUDENT
        - yeah so STUDENT we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis
        - Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means
        - Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples
        - Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def
        - Does that make sense?
        - Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is
        - does that make sense?
        - Hi
        -  [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today
        -  I'm Ms
        - So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers
        - So we have a lot of different answers
        - So let's look back in our texts
        -  Let's think about it
        -  And let's see if we had the best answer
        -  Okay
        - Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question
        - So did anybody talk about that? Let's see
        - You get it?
        - Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said
        - So do you understand how we could improve your answer?
        - So that makes sense?
        - Anybody have any questions about that question?
        - That make sense?
        - Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed
        - Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers
        - You ready?
        - so and you guys had varying levels of understanding
        - And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow
        -  Um, STUDENT and Oliver
        -  Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer
        - All right
        - And I don't think you had
        -  Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - You understand that
        -  Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused
        - How Does everybody feel after you read that passage
        - Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right
        - So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?
        - But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too
        -  STUDENT, it's totally okay when you just-
        - Whoa, okay
        -  So, that's okay
        -  So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them
        - STUDENT
        -  Do you know what that means
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - That's right
        -  What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?
        - What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?
        - There's always things you can learn
        - You guys see that?
        -  Yes
        -  So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you guys about your answers that you guys put For question number one
        -  STUDENT
        - I'm good
        - Yeah, I want you guys to just look at the question
        - And I want you to keep that in your mind
        -  Just a minute
        -  Okay
        - Does that make sense
        -  So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is
        - Very good
        -  Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?
        - So, let's look
        -  So what did we, what did we look at and very closely
        - Very good
        -  Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response
        -  STUDENT
        - Hi, everybody
        -  Yes
        -  Did you have questions
        -  Let's see
        - Let's look at that
        -  Yes
        - Hey guys, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me
        -  STUDENT
        - Okay, awesome
        -  So let's take a quick look at our responses
        -  Right
        - I think you may still be confused STUDENT
        -  Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn
        - Mm hmm
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something
        -  The moon and we are going to share our answers
        - So let's talk about your answers you already read the article
        - In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there
        -  So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to
        -  But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article
        - So you kind of see where we went wrong?
        -  Today, STUDENT, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today
        - Thank you for your help
        -  What was the Oh, pardon me, STUDENT, Farrah
        -  And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so STUDENT
        -  So that's good
        -  Yes, question
        - Thank you
        -  That's an area we can improve
        - And you think you've got it out
        -  So there were some room for
        - Does that make sense
        -  That's okay
        - So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff
        - You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any
        - Does that make sense
        -  Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question
        - Alright guys, any more questions can be any other way
        - So I'm STUDENT or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer
        - stop right there
        -  Okay
        -  So did everyone, did everyone read that with her
        - Did you read that STUDENT with her? Okay
        -  STUDENT, id you read that you
        -  STUDENT So maybe we could look at this together
        -  Appreciate that answer
        - Okay
        -  And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        -  But let's talk about this for just a minute
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        -  And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today
        - We're going to talk about our
        - Stick around
        -  Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers
        - Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever
        - So we answered our last question
        -  So we're going to move on to a new question
        - Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done
        - Alright, so let's look at the question, right
        -  And let's look at your answers
        -  Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer
        - Yes
        -  Good
        - Does that make sense?
        -  Are there any more questions
        - Great
        - Yeah, so I understand
        -  And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer
        -  That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text
        -  So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for
        - Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading
        - What do you guys have questions about so
        -  For instance,
        - So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example
        - So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to
        - So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to
        - Does everybody see that sentence
        -  So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking
        - Okay
        - Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different
        -  Yes?
        - So we are going to think a little bit
        - Okay, so, reflecting in our answer
        - Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject
        -  Okay, don't feel it's wrong
        -  Thank you for for your input
        - Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more
        -  And you can connect that with what you are learning
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA
        - Make sense?
        - Does anybody else have any questions about their answer
        - So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does
        - You guys think so?
        -  Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing
        -  You guys found in the article
        - And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today
        -  So I really liked reading all of your answers
        - Yeah, you got it?
        -  So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers
        - It is cool
        - Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so
        -  So remember back to our question
        -  We just have to find convincing evidence for its value
        - That's right
        -  And like you said, we've done that
        -  We have tons of ways that it can be used
        -  Right
        -  I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood
        - Think we all should be here
        - So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments
        -  Okay, STUDENT, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer
        - And that's what we're doing right now in this class
        -  We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers
        -  Does that sound good
        -  See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence
        - I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody
        - Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route
        -  I'm going to look at your responses, real quick
        - Let's see
        - In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time
        -  And that's a good response so
        - So let's think a little bit deeper about that
        -  And so, so we've decided and
        - we have a lot of good information
        - Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to STUDENT to you read and see if you can find something different than Farrah
        - Does that answer your question, STUDENT
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit
        -  Okay
        -  And let's just see where we get
        -  Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there
        - Okay
        -  Did you read it for me
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words
        - You see it?
        -  And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future
        - Well, we might can look just a little bit closer
        -  Would that be okay?
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys
        -  Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use
        - Okay
        - Exactly
        -  That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track
        -  So what machine discovered water
        - A lunar orbiter
        -  But we could have made it just a little bit more detail
        - Absolutely
        -  So do you understand how your answer was right
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better
        -  Does that make sense now
        - Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter
        - So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at
        - We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it
        -  Yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Alright, so you have all shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here
        -  That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn
        -  Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn
        -  That's awesome
        -  So the question is asking us
        -  So you've all shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question
        - All right
        - Now, if all five of us can agree upon one response
        -  STUDENT
        -  Yes
        -  Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole group response
        - So all five of us
        -  We all have I heard some really great answers
        - Well, I think there's always room
        -  To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses
        - Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was
        -  And your responses
        -  Correct?
        -  I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Do you know how you could have
        - Does that make sense?
        -  Do you not remember reading that part
        - STUDENT
        - And so the water that they found is microscopic
        -  Do we know what the word microscopic means?
        -  STUDENT, do you know what microscopic mean? No?
        - Everybody
        -  But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more
        -  Okay
        - Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it
        -  And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space
        -  I noticed we kind of had a
        - Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon
        - Very in range of responses
        -  Some of y'all kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off
        -  And then I noticed that you put the same answer as STUDENT
        -  So does that make sense to you
        - Yeah
        -  Also, buddy
        -  Okay, so
        -  And then we can kind of talk it through
        - I think that makes sense
        -  Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses
        - Alright so this event and Divya What do y'all think is all kind of had the same answer
        - Does that make sense
        -  Once we've talked about it some more, um,
        - That is pretty cool
        -  You'll have to go home and show him this article
        - And so I'm going to pull back up your responses
        - So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers
        - Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article
        - I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?
        - Who told you that, that's not true
        -  I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art
        - We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say
        -  We were able to clarify that
        -  That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information
        -  That makes sense? Okay
        -  And when you said a small machine
        - And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you guys share with me your responses on the question
        - Does that make sense to you all
        - Does that make sense
        - Okay? Does that make sense?
        - The Lunar
        - ?
        - Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a group
        - Does that make sense
        - Does anybody
        -  Does anybody have any questions
        -  STUDENT, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning
        - And that may be the case
        - I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So the question is,
        - If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer
        -  So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?
        -  Good job
        - OK, so the Lunar Orbiter
        - To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have
        -  Okay, so she brought up
        - Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it
        - And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing
        -  You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like STUDENT and I'm sure to the rest of you
        -  We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered
        - And STUDENT
        -  The same thing discovers like a verb
        -  You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today
        - Okay
        -  And once you run it
        -  And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb
        - Discover great
        -  A lot of you are doing it
        -  It's going to connect you back
        - When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for
        -  And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event STUDENT, sorry
        - So we, we read the text
        -  Did everybody understand the text water on the moon
        - Everybody understand?
        - Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?
        - Let's great STUDENT Maybe you can share some
        - Some ideas with us about the article
        - Okay, so I'm happy that y'all are all here today and I was looking over your responses
        - Everyone agree
        -  And that's okay
        -  We're going to look back at the paragraph
        - Yep
        -  Okay
        -  Um,
        -  I know that some of y'all had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper
        -  So we're looking over your responses
        - We just want to be able to give the best answer
        -  So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more
        - That he gave us
        - I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits
        - Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that
        -  So we got the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's work on formulate this sentence together
        -  Does anyone have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment
        - Perfect
        -  So what other
        -  Okay
        - That's good, that's good
        -  And you guys answered in your journal some questions
        -  So we all, we all just read water on the moon
        -  And I want to start
        -  And I saw your previous journal entry
        - So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT?
        - Does that make sense
        -  You can do it, I believe you can do it
        - But then your answer is gonna be awesome
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - So I'm going To the question and your answer really quick
        -  Okay
        -  Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new
        - You already know all about space
        - can we now see why that makes sense
        -  STUDENT
        - I think you guys have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there
        -  Yes
        -  Why don't you stick with us
        - All right, well, STUDENT
        - And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space
        -  So why don't you stick with us and
        - See what you can learn today
        -  Alright
        -  Let's, let's look at those two
        - So if nobody has any other equipment
        - answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question
        -  So does that make sense as to why
        -  STUDENT, I saw your hand go up
        - So does that make sense
        - Give you just a moment
        - And when you're done, give me a thumbs up or raise your hand
        - So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one
        - Well, let's double check our answers
        -  OK
        -  The way that it's asking us to
        -  That way we know for sure that we have answered the question
        - There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers
        -  Is everybody done reading
        - About 10 more seconds
        - Hi guys
        -  So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to all look back to the
        - So you guys have already came up with an answer to this question
        - And who knows, you might even learn something new, as
        - Well, that's okay
        -  It doesn't hurt to learn a little more right
        -  So I looked over all of your answers for the question
        -  And I wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers
        - I'm excited to work with you guys
        -  So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers
        - Alright friends
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text
        - Hmm
        -  Alright
        -  Okay
        -  But we're all in this group to work on answering some questions
        -  Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space
        - Okay, STUDENT, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and Farrah
        -  So our question that was posed to us
        -  We're going to take a look at that
        - Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person
        - Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text,
        - STUDENT are you looking at, paragraph two, there
        - Does that make sense
        -  It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we
        - In my room
        -  I have a favorite word
        -  I want you to well fake it and see what happens
        -  If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction
        - I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident
        -  Does that make sense
        - If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together
        - I hear that you guys have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart
- intent: r130.1
  examples: |
        - that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope And that microscope was used so actually sorry um
        - So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things
        - Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        -  But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon
        -  You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - It is semi right
        - And that is very close and
        -  But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage
        - Not exactly
        -  However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits
        - Then once they figured out that there was
        -  Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there
        - That there was water on the moon
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope
        -  It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - Not completely wrong
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment
        -  And STUDENT you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - Yeah, sure
        -  Okay
        -  That's right
        -  But we're going to look for one more thing
        -  Could you tell me what word another word that you circled
        -  One more
        - Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word
        -  Other key word in the question so STUDENT
        -  And that's absolutely something that was in that reading
        -  That is absolutely true
        - STUDENT scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here
        - One is kind of a version of the other slits
        -  Think about it
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct
        - Yeah, and that's right, they do use that
        -  Right
        -  So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon
        - Awesome
        -  Okay
        -  If it were astronauts on the moon
        -  That's right
        -  The astronauts use all that you are correct in that,
        - Well enough
        -  So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in
        - Well, okay
        -  So, that is correct
        -  Everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again
        - Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points
        -  They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question
        -  And that was right too
        -  But that was not enough for that question
        - STUDENT says that NASA sent a small machine
        -  Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but
        -  So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response
        - Um, I think that we can do even better
        -  You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me
        -  STUDENT So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you
        - That's right
        -  We're almost exactly where we want to be
        - STUDENT
        -  That was really, really good
        -  But we're so close now
        -  We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there
        -  So thank you for your
        - That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope
        - And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question
        - So let's look at your answer
        -  Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do
        - That's very knowledgeable of you point that out
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead
        -  And we're going to dig deeper
        - Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer
        - So STUDENT
        -  You are right, they, they set that small machine
        -  And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        - Okay, STUDENT and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely
        - Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there
        - That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?
        - and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more
        -  So if we put STUDENT's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer
        - Okay, so that's that's part of an up
        -  The answer is that we could have more space having more room
        -  And let's see
        - Okay, good
        -  So that's a good start on your answer
        - STUDENT had a good start on his too
        - Well, it's not completely wrong
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close
        -  Um, so yeah, good job
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope
        -  So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer
        - That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing
        - Because yes, they would use all of that  but
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        -  You just need to elaborate a little bit more
        - No, it's not wrong
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon
        - That NASA sent a small machine
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space
        -  I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction
        -  So I want everybody to look at the text
        - So, STUDENT
        -  So you've got part of the answer, right?
        - In the polar craters
        - You've got a piece of it
        -  Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was
        - Yeah
        -  They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it
        - Well, you're right
        - So, STUDENT
        -  But what you have is a great start
        -  Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now
        -  And that is correct
        - So you said that NASA sent a small machine
        -  The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,
        - That's good
        -  They do need that
        - So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe
        - Okay, so they did find
        - Craters water on the moon,
        -  You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong
        - And STUDENT, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  They did
        -  In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water
        -  Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer
        - Mhmm
        - And because STUDENT just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this
        -  And so, Hey STUDENT I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct
        -  So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space
        - Okay, yeah, you're right
        -  And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question
        - Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct
        - They did
        -  And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like STUDENT said
        - Yeah, okay
        -  So looking at your responses
        -  I will say this, STUDENT
        -  You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response
        - STUDENT, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon
        -  Okay, they did find craters with water
        - Not necessarily
        - All right, now STUDENT, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right
        -  Okay, good
        - Right
        -  So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it
        - Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  But they did find water in some of those places
        - That's not entirely true
        - We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you guys said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things
        - What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope
        - So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool
        -  So great job
        - So you were right in that it was a small machine
        -  STUDENT,
        -  So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet
        -  So you're absolutely right
        - No, no
        -  Okay
        - Those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon
        -  There's definitely no oxygen in space,
        - Okay
        -  And that would be that would be correct
        -  It's part of the answer
        - Well, it's part
        - Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine
        -  That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was
        - And STUDENT, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water
        - Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon
        -  So, good job
        -  Yeah, yeah
        - I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden
        -  Did you look at discover
        - It's not that it was the wrong answer
        -  It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question
        -  They're using a microscope to see the water
        - So you both are on the right track here in the equipment
        - You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is
        - So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine
        -  NASA does use all types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things
        -  So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits
        - So, you are correct
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope
        - So you're partially right when you kind of say that the
        -  I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a
        - Oh, that's really interesting
        - Let's talk about it, STUDENT
        -  So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's
        -  I can tell you read part of the text
        -  That's true
        - So again, that's true
        -  And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water
        - All right, but you're definitely on the right
        -  You guys are really thinking and I like where you're headed
        - STUDENT and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon
        -  And you guys are both on the right track
        -  Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use
        - Absolutely, absolutely
        -  Those are some great observations
        -  But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So I think you we're on the right track
        - And the scientific tool
        - Her perfect so STUDENT, you were absolutely on the right track
        -  You're absolutely right
        -  So a lot of equipment is huge
        - Absolutely
        -  They do
        -  But what we have to do
        - I think you guys did a great job and you were on the right track
        - They absolutely do
        -  Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking
        - Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there
        - Was not with that microscope
        - Yes
        -  So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I think that with all of her answers
        -  We're all getting on the right track
        - You are getting to the right answer
        -  They use the microscope to look closely at the water
        - Yes, I know what you mean
        - They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that
        - Well, that's very good
        -  So the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right STUDENT
        -  They need the oxygen to be able to breathe
        -  You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks
        - Okay STUDENT Let's look at your answer
        -  You know, when they are in space
        -  That is very true
        -  So the scientists, they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them
        - OK
        - Yes, small, but it's actually smaller than small, microscopic is a really big word that means very, very small, small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool
        -  Absolutely
        - That's a great question
        -  When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water
        -  You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right
        - That's absolutely right, but we're only Halfway right it's as if we have, you know, we're, we got a foot in the door
        -  But we got to get the rest of the way in
        - So we are halfway,
        - so STUDENT and Oliver, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water
        -  I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon
        -  So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard
        -  I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon
        - Sure
        -  Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space
        - So in essence
        -  Right
        -  They need to breathe
        - And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,
        - Absolutely
        -  They need that water to be able to drink, be able to survive
        -  So your initial answer was correct
        -  What do you guys think
        -  But what Miss STUDENT just read and what's advantages told us
        - Mm hmm
        -  It makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see
        - Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for
        -  So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples
        - Right
        - Okay, so looking at those
        -  Yes, you wouldn't need those for space exploration
        - They do us all a lot of tools like that
        -  We just had a fun one more tool
        - Well, it was right
        -  You had one thing, but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right
        -  Do you have any audio
        - So STUDENT helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope
        -  But we're still trying to figure out what other tool even
        -  So even you had said
        -  So we found one tool
        -  It says, what other what tools
        - OK, so the microscope
        -  Is it wrong, but we've answered one part of the question
        -  So now we want to
        -  We want to find the other tool so microscope was correct, but we want to find the other tool also in our story
        - So you have one of the items we they needed to find water on the moon
        -  Let's see if we can find the other item that I needed on the moon in the
        - No, I think you all helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time
        -  It's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right
        -  So your answer wasn't completely wrong
        -  You did mention how NASA did send a small machine
        - Okay
        - I would love for you to use the actual your, your answer was not completely wrong
        - Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon
        - And that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment
        -  I appreciate that
        -  So you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end
        -  Right
        -  So again, your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text
        - Okay, so that is a really good thing to bring up STUDENTon
        -  That's a great answer
        -  But the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph
        -  It is a small machine
        - Yes, and that's great
        -  That's what a microscope is
        - But it would, it wouldn't be the thing that found the water
        - Okay well after we asked the question, your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for
        - So, STUDENT and Luis also found different paragraphs
        -  So there are multiple answers
        - yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why I have you guys answering any
        - The lunar orbiter is another equipment on and then, as their fellow classmate also mentioned in her sentences shall be getting to sort of them said microscopes yeah
        - um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up, but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence
        - You are correct STUDENT but not the answer is exactly looking for
        - That is true, but it's not fully insured
        - If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment
        - As I said, everyone else, your answer is correct, but it's not exactly the answer I was looking for
        - know your background knowledge is correct, but he's not the answer, or the way that I would have where did the answer
        - because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for
        - wide range, you could have multiple answers like how STUDENT said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes Chris
        - Alright, so STUDENT as I was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water, because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer
        - STUDENT, you started off your response really well
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA sent a small machine, you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um
        - So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so
        -  So you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment
        - um your you, your answer was NASA sent a small machine
        - but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water
        - Which is right, we all know, that's a known fact
        - but you didn't answer the question
        - But that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable
        - Well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment
        - Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water
        - Not what they wear
        -  You just need a bit more
        - So you're on the right path
        -  So, that makes sense
        - so STUDENT you have one part and Jazmin had the other part, and we need to add it together
        - STUDENT you are um you are on the right track, you do mention the microscope
        - yeah, so we are, microscope is part of that
        - yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer
        - Our answers are a little bit just -they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations
        -  I'll read it to you
        -  So what's your, your response
        - Yeah
        -  Was NASA send a small machine, which is true, NASA did send a small machine
        -  You're right
        -  You need a scientific tool called the microscope
        -  We also need
        -  That's right
        - So STUDENT
        -  You're right
        - All right, STUDENT you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start
        -  And that is very true
        -  They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon
        - Yes
        - Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use
        - I just think that I could see a little bit more room for improvement
        -  So
        - You do? Well STUDENT I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text
        - but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge, so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon, but
        - For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks
        - So your answer wasn't wrong
        -  You said that NASA uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine
        -  That's true
        -  That's correct
        -  I think you had a really great start to a response there
        - There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so
        - They did need that
        -  STUDENT was right about that one
        -  They use that, as well
        -  It was just like I was telling STUDENT
        -  So we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it, and it's very true, but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked
        - Also, sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong, but it's not answering the question that was asked
        - Yes, yeah, those are other tools that scientists use
        -  It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you guys are highlighting the right answers in the passage
        - So next time
        - you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon
        -  That's what our passage told us
        - you're absolutely right, so, while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon
        - but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand
        - Exactly there's a possibility that the Lunar that there's a Microscope on the Lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon
        - Part of it
        - Your answer is a great start okay oh
        - Yeah, it's really - it is really important
        - And but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important
        - so you weren't wrong I just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger
        - So I don't think that your answer so like I was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this group, I think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement
        - and give you the same note that I gave STUDENT, although the answer is correct, I think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to Oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is
        - Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger
        - I part of what I think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope,
        - So STUDENT your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had
        - Well, there is a couple of answers
        - And then STUDENT, we're going to look at your answer
        -  And it was really great, and I think that you really understood the text, but I'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking
        - Can you tell me what equipment they use so STUDENT and Oliver, you're not completely wrong
        -  But that's not the full answer
        -  A microscope is a piece of equipment
        -  Do you remember reading that
        - Right, and then STUDENT and Deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water
        -  It just wasn't correct for that question
        -  It wasn't a bad answer
        - So that's good
        -  You thought through that
        - so STUDENT
        -  Your answer was correct
        - Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe
        -  You're right
        - They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading
        -  There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified
        -  But they didn't use that to specifically find the water
        - I want to take a look even closer STUDENT
        -  So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it
        -  STUDENT, just something you'd like to add
        - So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators
        - What I just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important,
        - So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - But let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related I think you're all on a really good path, but we're not quite there yet
        -  So that is one part of the one part of the answer
        - Yes
        - Okay, so there is another tool in there
        -  Totally
        -  And I completely understand that
        -  So I love that you answered the question because your question is
        - Totally
        -  Your question was right or your question was spectacular a plus
        -  I'm going to say your question was right
        - If I had to say
        -  Your question was wrong
        - So that's like, okay, you know, but I want your question your answer to be spectacular
        - The microscope is a tool that they use
        -  But I think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use
        - Thank you for that answer STUDENT
        -  Yes
        -  So they used a lunar orbiter to discover the water and then they used a microscope in order to be able to see it closer, since it was so small
        - Teacher : So you were almost there
        -  Nice job
        - Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect
        -  Step number two
        -  But now we need to put it all together
        - But you were missing step number one
        -  So, STUDENT did a great job of explaining
        -  Step number one and you did a great job of explaining
        -  We need tons of equipment that we don't use down here, right
        -  Oh, I'm sure that's absolutely right
        -  They to go up into space
        - Right
        - So we need to, there's two parts of this answer
        -  And her answer with what STUDENT said in her answer, there's two parts
        -  So we need to combine what STUDENT set
        -  STUDENT, so it does
        - Wow, that's a great start
        - So you are right, they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye
        - You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water
        - So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks
        -  I do think those would be helpful
        -  But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water
        - But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope
        -  We do use water to grow things
        -  I'm not sure that that would work on the moon
        -  You're exactly right
        -  Water
        - Wow
        -  Yeah
        - I don't think that we could
        -  Um, I don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon
        - Yeah, I think you're right
        -  I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different
        - Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question
        -  But that's not what's really being asked of us
        - Did they say, did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water
        -  So yes, that is true that the water is so small you need a microscope
        -  And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, STUDENT
        - So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon
        - That that's not quite really answering the question, like, as we go on
        - We are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine,
        -  There is there is a part of the equipment
        -  And yes, you're right
        -  Right
        - You say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water
        -  But that's when they
- intent: r110.1
  examples: |
        - And STUDENT I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.
        - hi STUDENT I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you
        - yeah awesome so you identify and equipment
        - Yes, ice and ice deposits, yes STUDENT
        - Yes, good the investigation part is good, let me look at the question again
        - Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah
        - All right, i'll let you think about that question, while I work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay
        - yeah that's a great answer STUDENT
        - STUDENT can I have just a second
        - yeah they do STUDENT
        - yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords
        - Absolutely
        - Absolutely, what about you STUDENT
        -  STUDENT, what about you
        - Absolutely
        - That's really cool
        -  But let's get back on topic
        - Um, well, you're right
        - Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question
        - STUDENT, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope
        - That's cool
        - That would be really cool
        -  A, then, what were you gonna say
        - Right
        - Yeah
        - You did some great reading STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - Let's just hang out for a minute
        -  Let's talk about some things
        - Okay hold on just a moment
        -  Okay
        - Yes, and STUDENT
        - Yes, they did
        -  He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Also STUDENT's answer
        - All right, thank you for your answers
        - That's okay
        - Yeah
        - You're right, you're right
        - Your right
        - I appreciate you guys coming in today you've all done a very good job
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay
        -  And that question and you answered it
        -  So you guys did really good writing down an answer
        - OK
        -  OK
        -  I'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph
        - That's great
        -  Okay
        - Good
        - All right, well, that's awesome
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what STUDENT had said
        - You're okay
        -  Thanks, STUDENT
        - Wonderful
        -  I'm so glad you're ready to help
        -  Yes, there is a lot of equipment that gets used
        - You're right
        - Nice
        -  Yes, that was really interesting
        -  I love that
        -  What a good observation
        - Yeah
        -  That is really cool
        - Wow
        -  I love all of those answers
        - Yeah, that was a big question
        - Right
        -  That's a really good observation
        -  I love that
        - Okay, I like that answer a lot and STUDENT, would you like to add anything to that
        -  That's very true
        -  STUDENT, what would you like to add
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        - Oh, let's wait your turn, please
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - Gotcha
        -   You're doing a great job of listening
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for clarifying that
        - STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - Okay, let me let me talk with STUDENT for just a moment and I'll come back to you
        - You're absolutely right
        - Right
        -  Is that what you put
        - I have written, I have that you put scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay, while are you looking for
        -  I'm going to talk with the other four
        -  OK
        - I'm really proud of you guys for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - STUDENT, you put the same thing I Farrah
        -  Correct
        - So I'm STUDENT
        -  What I have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close
        - Okay and I'm going to talk with STUDENT and Jazmin and Luis
        -  I saw you, that you put NASA sentma small machine
        - STUDENT in your answer
        -  So very good job, um,
        -  And I do want to give you guys a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers
        - Just looked at your revised answers
        - Okay
        -  Okay
        -  So we'll talk about that here in just a minute
        - Yeah, NASA does have
        - Thank you for your input, STUDENT But I just asked Farrah a question
        -  Would you mind letting her respond?
        - Ah, there we go
        -  Okay
        - Very good, thank you
        - Absolutely
        -  Thank you for sharing now
        - There you go
        -  Very good
        -  So that is the answer that we're looking for
        -  STUDENT
        -  That is correct
        -  Thank you
        -  Right
        - And I think, STUDENT you had said the same thing is Farrah
        -  Then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that Astronauts use
        -  Awesome
        - And STUDENT
        - You said that they use lots of equipment
        -  Right
        - Very good
        -  STUDENT Thank you for reading that again for us
        -  So you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely
        -  Right
        - Well, that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer
        -  STUDENT
        -  STUDENT
        - And Deb, you had the same answer
        -  Didn't you
        - Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah
        - That was something super interesting
        -  Right
        -  That would be really, really great
        - Ooh, that would be awesome
        - Good awesome, amazing
        - Good and STUDENT?
        -  Yeah, that's a really good question and answer
        - Okay, thank you
        -  The next class about that topic, but I think that, yes, it's a very good topic
        - Maybe, maybe, maybe we can read another article
        -  Thanks, STUDENT
        - Microscope
        -  STUDENT
        - That's a very good answer
        -  Thank you
        - Thank you, STUDENT
        - Good
        -  Thank you
        -  Good answer
        -  Thank you
        - Yes, that's a really good answer
        -  Yes, mean you are right
        - STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon
        -  That's very good
        - That's very good
        -  Um so,
        -  I'm proud of you
        -  That's good
        -  That's good
        - Phenomenal
        -  STUDENT you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and Jazmin knocked it out of the park
        - Um, and I think another real benefit here
        -  STUDENT and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like Luis had there and--
        - That's wonderful
        -  All right
        -  So, STUDENT, what's up man, how are you
        - Okay
        - Awesome
        -  I appreciate it
        -  That means just paying attention
        -  Good job
        -  That's very smart picking that up,
        - All right, good job
        - Okay
        -  And I know that's that's
        - That's, you know, that's interesting way to think about that question
        -  Let's go back to STUDENT and Luis over here while you're looking at that
        - Why don't you
        - Boom
        -  Very good
        -  That'd be pretty cool huh
        - Oh that is just around the corner
        -  On Musk is doing great things so
        - You know, they're working on it
        -  Thank you
        - Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope
        -  Awesome
        -  Right
        -  So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found
        -  So you found that the craters are full of water
        - Okay
        - Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water
        - Yes, and survey, Anna
        - So I want to go back to what STUDENT was saying
        - Okay
        - So you all were the same
        -  So when you def
        -  So let's go back to what STUDENT Do you have a question
        - Yeah
        -  Tell me about your answer
        -  Let's STUDENT, let's go back to each for just a minute
        -  Keep your thoughts, just for a moment
        - Okay STUDENT Let's hold on just a second
        - STUDENT, can you hold that thought for just one moment
        - That's a good answer
        -  STUDENT, what would you like to add to the conversation
        -  What was that question that you had?
        - Okay, Harisson, what, you had your question, a question just a few minutes ago
        - That is correct
        -  They did send that
        - Exactly, exactly
        - So we could drink it
        - STUDENT said we could break it down to oxygen, hydrogen, we could breathe it
        -  We could use it for rocket fuel
        - That is awesome
        -  Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, so that could be one thing that's useful
        - Great job
        -  Good
        -  I really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it
        - So let's go ahead and talk about it
        - Alright, thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers
        -  Okay
        - And let's see, STUDENT, you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, well if you hold on to that
        -  And while I talked to some of the others
        -  Let's see
        - And jab
        -  You said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - It's right on to that
        -  Hold on just a minute and
        - Um, and now that we've talked about it
        - Yes
        -  Alright, so let's see what STUDENT wrote
        -  He recently wrote scientists found craters full of water on the moon,
        -  It is important
        - Mm hmm
        -  We do agree on that
        -  Good job
        - See that I'm glad you're still staying with our group, because that is some good insight
        -  All right, let's see
        - Um, I think that would be valuable to
        - That's pretty cool
        - Okay, STUDENT
        - Um, yeah, I think, I think you have pretty good answer
        - Okay, I'm STUDENT
        - Well, I think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here
        - Alright
        - Okay
        -  So you did have the small machine is what you said
        -  Your answer was actually really close
        - so like STUDENT and Oliver you guys said that you needed a scientific
        - tool called a microscope
        - Oh really, that is awesome
        - Well, I am glad that you know a lot
        -  And you're right, and then also STUDENT also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split
        - Yes
        - So you guys you in depth said no and then STUDENT and Chris said yes
        -  And then STUDENT kind of gave some details
        - Well, you might not need help, but you might be able to help me help the rest of the group
        - That is very
        - A very good way to look at that
        - Well, that's really cool
        - Yeah STUDENT
        - Oh, that's really cool
        - And I think that three of you STUDENT Jazmin and even I think you all had said yes it's valuable and you gave one of their reasons, and I think that was great
        - Okay, thank you for that input
        -  Okay
        -  Right
        -  And that was one of the tools that they are using what
        - Microscope
        - Okay
        - Okay, thank you
        -  Okay
        - Okay, well, I would love to hear that information that you can give us from this question that we've kind of want to talk about now
        - That's very good
        -  Good job
        - Right
        - Yeah, that's really cool to STUDENT, what about you
        -  That's really interesting that I'm glad you brought that into the discussion
        - That's true
        -  I haven't read that, but I'll be sure to look it up
        -  Wrong student
        -  I said the wrong name
        - Oh, yes
        -  Sorry
        - Equipment
        -  And STUDENT?
        -  Yes, that's great
        -  So and in your answer, you'd said that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yes
        -  Yes
        -  Good job
        -  That's the sentence I want you to read
        -  Good job
        - Oh good
        -  That's really good
        -  Thank you for contributing that
        -  Good job
        -  Great job
        - Oh good
        -  OK
        -  All of you guys, I appreciate all of you guys volunteered to read, and you've all done a very good job
        -  So let's get through, if, do you guys have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil?
        -  Good
        -  You could even say like
        -  And or another way you could say that would be, that's a very good answer
        - Good Lunar Orbiter
        -  Good
        - Okay, so I'm going to start by talking with Miss STUDENT
        -  So you said
        - No,
        -  STUDENT
        - Is awesome
        - Yeah, that would be awesome if we could do that
        - Well, can you tell me what the title of this was
        - That's really cool, STUDENT
        - Okay, good
        - They do have to use those spacesuits but well yes they do have to use them
        -  And that's the only way they can be out there in space looking
        - Microscope
        -  I love how you found that in the reading
        -  Very good
        - Okay, but I'm glad reading the text and you notice microscope was in there
        -  I love how you were reading closely to the tax STUDENT, what did you find in the text
        - Okay, very good
        - Okay, very good
        -  I love how you are also reading very closely and looking at the details in the story
        - That is fine
        -  That is okay
        -  At least you were looking closely at your words why you were reading
        - Hey, that's okay
        -  Good job STUDENT
        - Okay, very good observation
        -  While you were reading
        - Okay, very good
        - Okay
        -  Will you hold that in for a little bit and thinking about those spaces, maybe we can talk about that later
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  Very proud of each and every one of you
        - But each one of you did a fabulous job reading and looking at all the information and taking it in
        -  So really good job guys
        -  Okay?
        - Okay, well, there may be somebody here that does so let's all just take our turns and we'll see where it goes
        - Good job, STUDENT
        -  So once you reread it, you found a different answer correct?
        - Okay, who would like to read the second one
        - Very good
        -  Who wants to read the last paragraph
        - Okay so STUDENT, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Yeah
        - So I noticed STUDENT that you talked about a microscope in your answer, that right
        -  Thank you
        - Okay you
        -  You're good to go
        -  Good job
        -  STUDENT
        - Yes
        - Possibly
        -  Who knows but that would be really cool now
        - And you said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Alright guys, I've heard some really great responses
        -  Um, let's see
        -  You guys are doing a great job working together
        - Yeah, they do
        -  They, they have to use a ton of equipment
        - So STUDENT, you said that they found craters full of water on the moon
        - And you said that they use a microscope so
- intent: r310.1
  examples: |
        - awesome so STUDENT and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points
        - amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with STUDENT and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on Even better answer
        - and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to
        - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well
        - I love that you brought in that background knowledge STUDENT that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
        - Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story
        - yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
        - yeah so STUDENT I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
        - yeah I love, how you summarize that are STUDENT, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris
        - yeah STUDENT that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so
        - yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
        - So um STUDENT what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
        -  right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon
        - Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece
        - Good
        -  I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
        -  So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
        - Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space
        - Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that
        -  So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
        - That's a good way of thinking about it, STUDENT
        - You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
        -  And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that
        - And they did
        -  That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
        - I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together
        - But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also
        -  I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see
        - Excellent, excellent
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  Thank you
        -  And I appreciate that answer
        -  You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text
        -  That was one of our right answers
        - It was a right answer
        - Well, I appreciate that
        -  I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that
        -  And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
        -  So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
        -  Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money
        - Excellent
        - Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see STUDENT's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy
        -  I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
        - Good
        - Okay
        -  Um, so I can see STUDENT I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source
        -  You did a good job
        - Yeah
        -  Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence
        - Good, good
        -  Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,
        - That's a very good point
        -  So you could circle convincing evidence together
        -  Yeah, that's a great idea
        - Well, that's okay
        -  And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
        -  Even if it's not valuable right now
        -  Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
        -  Now, but in the future
        - So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable
        -  It would be
        - I love that STUDENT, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if
        - I love that you cited where you found it in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true
        -  Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
        - And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing
        - You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
        - Okay, great
        -  I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from
        -  Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true
        - STUDENT, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out
        -  And I'm really proud of you for finding that
        - Oh, what a nice way to explain that
        - Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small
        -  Which is great and you all refer back to the text
        - You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
        - Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use
        -  Thank you for that
        -  That's a some awesome prior knowledge STUDENT
        - So I can add a bit of background info here
        -  Um, so, STUDENT Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space
        -  And you offer a lot of insight,
        -  Okay
        -  That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from
        - Yes, yes
        -  Well, maybe I phrased that poorly
        -  STUDENT
        - Absolutely
        -  Very good
        -  I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
        -  I think that's very good
        -  I like your use of detail there
        -  And that's, that's very good
        - Okay
        -  I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
        -  Um,
        - You give really good strong details on that very specific part
        -  So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
        - Okay, that's, that's great
        -  I think you've got the main idea
        -  And so at the heart of your answer there
        -  And that's really exciting
        -  We found some water on the moon
        -  Thank you very much for listening
        -  Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
        -  So I appreciate that
        - Well, one
        -  That was very good
        -  What I said there
        - Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
        - That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out
        -  But when we look back at the question
        - Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as STUDENT, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking
        -  And that's a good skill
        - I love how STUDENT Oliver Chris and Jazmin were able to look specifically in the text
        - To use our background knowledge like STUDENT used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right
        -  We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
        - Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer
        -  And that is a great answer, our passage
        - I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it
        - Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned
        -  And I see why you would say that,
        - Okay, I understand
        - I see where you get that answer,
        - I like your thinking that is awesome
        -  You use details from our text to support your thinking
        -  So, that's awesome
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things
        - So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is
        - Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience
        - What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
        -  Good thinking, because we are talking about water
        - Okay, that's good
        -  We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more
        -  Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us
        - Okay
        -  So let's see
        -  Water is a valuable resource right
        - One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
        - Because that has the words we were just talking about
        -  So that was just the right place to look for that
        -  And you did find some evidence, didn't you
        - All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look
        - So you guys are all given really good details
        - So you guys are given really good details for that
        - I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
        - Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment
        -  So I think that you justified your answer and
        - So I think that you and STUDENT and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable
        - And I spoke to STUDENT
        -  So he justified his answer
        -  So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
        -  You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right
        - Um, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason
        -  I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
        - But I think that STUDENT's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated
        - Of the water and how the water could be used
        - you summarize very well okay and about the craters
        -  Right?
        -  You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        - Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer
        -  That is great
        -  Okay
        - I like that answer
        -  Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading
        -  And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information
        - Very good
        -  That's absolutely right
        - I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, STUDENT
        - Right
        -  They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
        - Awesome
        -  And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
        -  Um, STUDENT
        -  But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
        - That's exactly right
        -  STUDENT
        -  What about you,
        -  I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        -  You are good
        -  That's exactly right
        - You are good
        -  So like you said your answer
        -  And it looks like you've done that in your answer
        -  Okay
        -  STUDENT, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why
        -  So great job
        -  STUDENT?
        - That's exactly right
        - Right
        -  Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right STUDENT
        - I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water
        - But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool
        -  That was very good
        -  I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that
        - Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text
        -  And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
        -  Good
        -  I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
        - Yeah, yeah, you're right
        -  That's awesome
        -  So try to think about
        - Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer
        -  I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
        - Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters
        -  You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
        - Good
        -  All right
        -  And you also found that they both talked about water
        -  Now what did the question ask us to find about water
        - Good
        -  You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good
        -  Very good
        -  They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,
        - That is true
        - Good
        -  I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know
        -  So right after that the paragraph
        -  We want to be in, you're exactly right
        - Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes
        - Okay, so you did find some important information where
        -  So, you made a really important
        - Good, I agree that they're not ready
        - No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know
        -  They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
        - Mm hmm
        -  They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question
        -  That's awesome
        -  And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence
        - Yes, that was very good
        - Very good
        -  I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good
        - And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
        -  And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it
        - Okay, so we'll keep going
        - Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,
        - So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it
        - Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine
        -  So you're in the ballpark
        -  So you found the equipment
        - Okay
        -  And I like that you use that wording scientific tool
        - I like that you use that word scientific tool
        -  Great, great job there,
        -  And I really appreciate you explaining your answer
        - I do understand what you mean
        - Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer
        -  And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right
        - I agree with you
        -  Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there
        -  I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready
        -  So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good
        -  I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text
        -  Okay
        - Awesome
        -  Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you guys did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text 
        - Very good
        - Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff
        -  That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space
        - So that's a great job be able to identify what that means
        - So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
        -  And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable
        - Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer
        -  Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,
        - Okay, well, you know, good job
        - Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen
        -  STUDENT you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly
        - that is very good job
        - Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it
        -  Alright, so let's first look at the question again
        - And I was very impressed about how everyone took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking
        - A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective
        -  Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon
        -  You made a connection a detective
        - She used like a STUDENT use that his dad was an astronaut
        - I love that
        -  So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive
        - So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope
        -  So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer
        - So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong
        - And so I love that y'all are all thinking about the story and are using
        - Using the text to help support your answers,
        - I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together
        - That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon
        - That's really good
        -  You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like STUDENT
        -  And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion
        -  STUDENT, and that was perfect
        - Very good
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later
        - So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you
        -  You know that answer makes perfect sense
        - You do a great job of talking about the question
        -  As far as that goes
        -  
        -  So you obviously understand the question
        -  That's true
        - So again, we're just going to that
        -  So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important
        -  So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence
        - You do a great your answers
        -  Great
        -  Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        -  You can't survive without water
        -  And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion
        - what I would really like you to do, though
        - Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it
        - Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things
        -  You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence
        - That is true
        -  That is that is a great piece of text evidence
        - Right
        -  You're right
        - Yeah, exactly
        -  That was a great thought process, putting those two together
        -  Okay so convincing evidence and valuable
        -  And that is correct
        -  And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction
        - Yes
        -  And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer
        - That is correct
        - So I appreciate you looking at your
        - Answer and asking why
        -  I like how you're making that connection
        - Okay
        - Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question
        -  I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section
        -  So, good job there STUDENTon are deaf
        -  Sorry
        - Yes, exactly
        -  So,
        - Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that
        - Good job, they're reading into that
        - Yes, that is true
        -  I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you
        -  I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer
        - Yes, very good
        -  STUDENT
        - Very good
        -  He did a really good job
        -  I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us
        -  That's actually very well done,
        - And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
        - I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,
        - Yeah, that makes complete and total sense
        -  Well done
        -  That was a good job connecting the dots there
        -  It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter
        - So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific
        - And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as STUDENT
        -  Your thought process is a lot deeper as well
        -  First of all, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail
        - Great, that's, that's really good STUDENT
        -  So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found
        - Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question
        -  It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon
        -  And you're right
        -  You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope
        -  That's great
        - Okay
        -  I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit
        - Right
        -  Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits
        - Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters
        - Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen
        - Absolutely
        -  And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water
        - Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen
        - Right, well, and I love that you guys were able to close your eyes and see that and help you STUDENTelop that
        -  Miss STUDENT?
        - So you found that directly in the text
        -  That's really good
        -  Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer
        - Okay, I understand that
        - but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation
        - And I just like that
        -  That was your example
        - Okay, so just like STUDENT I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be
        - um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to
        - So STUDENT you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is
        - awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks 
        - And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like STUDENT is saying
        - he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text
        - Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question
        - That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um
        - And you were able to find that in the text good job
        - Great job pulling that out of the text
        - So I strength so far from that was, um, you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good
        - I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence
        - For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question
        - Do you think it's a good investment um I thought I thought your answer was great because, like
        - You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said
        - You um I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and
        - um so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of
        - Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county all messed up if you know what I mean well
        - STUDENT your response is actually really good
        -  I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
        - That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for
        - Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there
        - I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,
        - And then STUDENT
        -  So it was a great response
        -  You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text
        -  So what you said related to the text really well
        - And STUDENT, I think you had some great vocab sorry, did you have a question, Jazmin
        - yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of
        - i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was
        - But you use great academic knowledge
        - nd great academic vocab in your response
        - So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good
        - But you used great academic vocab in your response
        - They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two
        - And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers
        - I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful
        - Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better
        -  Awesome you got that right from the passage,
        - mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water
        -  So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,
        - STUDENT, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback
        - awesome so I see what you did,
        - and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer
        - awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,
        - awesome So yes, that included the important details
        - You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,
        - let's look at the last sentence, because I like what STUDENT brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money
        - And STUDENT I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon
        - I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon
        -  You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?
        - So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon
        - Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon
        -  That's a really good strategy
        -  STUDENT, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer
        - That is true
        - Yeah
        -  Thank you for pointing that out, STUDENT
        - And thank you STUDENT for explaining your answer and using the text really well
        - answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like STUDENT's
        -  You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where
        - Um so STUDENT I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading
        - It talks about specific things that the question asks
        - and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um
        - A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um STUDENT and Jazmin you guys really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate
        -  So STUDENT's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use
        -  And she answers NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, so STUDENT's response was NASA sent a small machine
        - Yes, thank you, that is
        - is really, really nice way to phrase that
        - that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer
        - I love, how you comprehend the reading so well
        - and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one
        - And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water
        - I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did
        - you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but
        - Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you guys read the reading and understood it
- intent: r210.2
  examples: |
        - So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember
        - It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense
        - Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean
        - Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that
        - Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof
        - Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer from that source
        - Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it
        - So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water
        -  We're not trying to look at it, STUDENT, did you have something to tell me
        - We're trying to discover it
        -  What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right
        -  And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that
        - Yeah, all those things are really important
        -  But in this article
        -  So what does equipment main guys
        - So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water
        - Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question
        -  That means the same thing
        - Good
        -  Does anybody know a synonym for the word investigate
        - Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking
        -  They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right
        -  We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So when we look back at our text
        -  So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object
        - You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment
        -  So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters
        -  But what tool where they using?
        -  It's telling us to talk about what equipment
        - You're right
        -  But if we look back at our question
        - So we need to find the equipment that they used
        - They did find water
        -  But the question wants to know what equipment did they use
        - But what equipment did they use to find it?
        - That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        -  But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon
        - They need oxygen
        - It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used
        -  It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment
        - And the question
        - What are the ways that it's being used
        - Or how can it be useful
        - If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking
        -  That would be your question
        - What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        -  So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it
        -  And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment
        - Yes
        - So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?
        - Good
        -  Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,
        -  It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon
        - That scientists use
        -  But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph
        - but we said when we circled in the second key word
        - In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word
        -  It's something that they did
        - But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you guys to find was evidence and valuable yes def
        -  So we know where it was
        - I wonder, it's asking about the equipment
        -  So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it
        -  But now we're asking about the machine
        -  So they're synonyms of each other
        -  So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym
        - You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool
        - do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking
        - So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?
        - Finding it but planning it for the first time
        - And remember, we're looking for equipment
        - So we're discovering water on the moon
        - but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it
        - Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon
        - We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist
        - Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of
        -  Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for
        -  Did they use to discover the water that's what STUDENT is saying
        - Okay, what equipment
        -  Yeah, so that's a really good question
        -  Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like STUDENT says the equipment that's used to discover the water
        - Gotcha
        -  Good job
        - Equipment discover and water
        -  So you guys picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover
        -  Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and
        - Good
        -  Do you guys know what discover means
        - Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon
        -  He is to discover water on the moon
        - So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist
        -  So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon
        - But let's look more at that question
        -  So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?
        -  Specifically, right
        - but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment
        -  Did they use to search for water on the moon
        -  I'm sorry
        - They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment
        -  Right
        - They're looking for quick the equipment
        - So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon
        - let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars
        -  Can you remind me what the question says,
        -  But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering
        -  Right
        - I'm glad we're able to see that
        -  A STUDENT Do you think that's a good idea
        -  It talking about more than one piece
        -  So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there
        -  It could be more than one
        - But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural
        - And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water
        - Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water
        -  So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water
        - Right
        - So putting that together
        - Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable
        - So potential
        -  It has the potential to be valuable
        -  That means it may it that is going to be valuable
        -  Right
        - The water on the moon
        -  What am I doing
        -  So when I think of that word discover
        -  And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something
        -  What are we doing STUDENT
        - When I first discover something
        -  I'm looking for it
        -  So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water STUDENT
        -  I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it
        -  I remember STUDENT said when we discover something I'm finding it
        - So what what might they have used to first discover
        - So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right
        - So what equipment
        -  Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon
        -  Did they used to discover
        -  Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things
        -  But the key was what equipment
        - So, so we needed to find the equipment
        -  So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it
        - So the key was what equipment
        -  Did they use to discover
        - So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text
        -  So what does discover mean
        - STUDENT, what is discover mean
        - Yes, that is a very good question
        -  So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically
        -  Okay, so what do we think valuable means
        - So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable
        - What do you think that means
        -  So this is asking could water from the moon be useful
        - Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful
        -  Okay
        - So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist
        - You think yes or no
        -  So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?
        - So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing
        -  Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms
        -  Who remembers what term
        - Let
        -  There's a term
        -  And the question that we're looking for
        - In the question
        - Oh, yes
        -  Mm hmm
        - So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right
        -  Water is important
        -  Yes, because the question does ask about water
        - There are key words
        -  And there's one more word that we use a lot in science
        - All right, I'm convincing is good
        - Okay, so what is evidence
        -  So all those equipments
        -  But we was looking for the tool for water
        -  But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water
        - So yes, you're right
        -  Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them
        - So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage
        - So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage
        - Teacher:I feel like the way the question was phrased
        -  They were specifically talking about the STUDENTice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um
        -  I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water
        - Because the question
        -  I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what STUDENTice actually discovered the water
        - Right
        - You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water
        -  You know why its valuable
        -  It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons
        - In the actual passage
        -  So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable
        - That would be very beautiful, very
        -  Did you find that in the text STUDENT
        - So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment
        -  Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon
        - So is there convincing evidence
        -  So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article
        -  Okay
        -  That water on the moon could be valuable
        -  What it says directly
        - Now this is a tricky question
        -  Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word
        -  Okay
        - So what is the meaning of valuable there?
        -  So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        -  So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?
        - Right
        - Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water
        -  But how did they discover the water
        -  I know they can look at the water with the microscope
        - Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space
        -  So in the question asks us
        -  But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space
        -  It says what equipment
        -  Where did they find it so
        -  Did they use not
        - But in the question
        -  So I agree
        - Okay
        -  They used to look at water is it what they find the water with
        - Is it talking about how they water or is it talking about
        -  It says, Is there convincing evidence
        - And I want to specifically look at the question
        - So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves
        -  So what does it mean to be valuable STUDENT
        -  And let's see, I wanted to talk with with um
        -  And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank
        - We're talking about water on the moon
        -  Do you have any really important words in that question
        - Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yes, discover
        -  So when you discover something you're looking for it
        - They have to investigate
        -  Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?
        - So they used
        -  What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?
        - But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find all that water because it
        -  In the story, which STUDENT brought up so that everybody had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found
        - And they also talk about craters
        -  How to find water on the moon, don't we, yes STUDENT
        - So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question
        -  The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water
        -  Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you guys about
        -  We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water
        - So right there
        - So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct
        -  Did they use to discover water
        -  So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment
        - So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage
        - Right
        -  And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water
        - How about the word evidence and the word value
        -  So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out
        - Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question
        -  There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them
        - It
        -  So you're going to be looking for our
        - but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology
        -  Did they need to discover that water
        - When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that
        - About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it
        -  But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand
        - So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon
        -  What, what are you looking for?
        - Okay and machines and tools that do what?
        - So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water
        - Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading
        - Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of
        - Water on the moon
        - That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water
        -  What did they use to find that
        - So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon
        - but what did they use it first to discover it so
        - Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use
        - So specifically, what do they use not their suits
        -  But what they use to find the water
        -  Does that make a little bit more sense
        - But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Want to know what did they use to find that water
        - But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is
        - Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover all right there
        -  What do you think buddy
        -  In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon
        - Okay well equipment is the key word
        -  Okay, does that make sense
        -  But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment
        - I agree with you
        -  What do you think buddy
        -  Those are all very important words STUDENT
        - Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable
        -  Okay
        -  OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important
        - Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,
        -  So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable
        -  So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense
        - How can water be valuable
        -  Okay
        -  But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So our key word here is equipment
        - So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that
        - So our key word here is equipment and discover
        -  Okay
        - Right
        -  And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does anybody can answer
        - All right
        -  Now, what, what does it mean if something is valuable
        -  Okay
        -  Good
        -  Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable
        - It's expensive
        - Right, something that you can use
        -  Okay, that's great
        -  This question is
        - Another way to say or state
        -  It's just asking
        - Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence
        - Right
        -  It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things
        -  So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water
        -  So what equipment do they used to help them discover water
        - So that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe
        - So we think of convincing evidence
        -  What does that mean to you, STUDENT
        - What does convincing mean
        - Okay, STUDENT what does convincing mean?
        - STUDENT what is convincing for you
        - So we're talking about convincing evidence
        -  Evidence means information that supports the statement being made
        -  So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports
        -  And that is a great answer
        - Okay
        -  Can anyone help me explain what the word discover means?
        -  But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important
        - Within within the actual text
        -  What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon
        - but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them
        - But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters
        - Okay, let's talk about evidence
        - What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be STUDENT
        -  Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?
        - And we're going to discover evidence and proof
        -  She's exactly right
        -  Very good
        -  Alright, so, STUDENT
        - Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope
        -  Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon
        -  It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question
        -  And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me
        - Back, here on earth
        - So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?
        - Okay, that's the question
        -  And so
        -  Does everyone here know what the word equipment means
        - Correct
        -  Those are all types of equipment
        -  And so what about the word discover
        -  Do we all know what the word discover means
        -  So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon
        - Excellent Harris and that is when you find something
        - Okay, good job
        -  So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon
        -  So to answer your question, STUDENT and deaf so far
        - Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon
        - It's not the question is not asking necessarily about
        - The way they found the water because the water is very small
        -  The key word is
        -  It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water
        - Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you
        - Discover the water
        -  So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use
        - So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon
        - But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water
        - We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for
        -  So it's a new
        - That's, that's true
        -  It's new to you
        -  That's absolutely true
        -  It's new to whoever finds it
        - So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon
        -  What is that question asking?
        - We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water
        -  So this is an argument piece
        - But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value
        -  So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable
        -  Can anybody give me another word for equipment?
        -  Does anybody take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment
        -  Well, first of all, can anybody tell me what equipment means
        -  So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about
        - Absolutely, you are on the right track
        -  So can anybody give me a synonym for the word equipment
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  First of all, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means
        - Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, guys, I want you guys to
        - turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask
        - what that question is
        -  Go ahead
        - Asking, What are those important words
        -  So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment
        - So what kind of things
        -  So first of all, I want to make sure
        -  So can you give me
        -  I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon
        - Because I think, judging by some of your responses
        - Another example of a word for equipment, STUDENT
        - What does it mean, what does it
- intent: r410.3
  examples: |
        - Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon
        - yeah you you so maybe I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope Go ahead
        - STUDENT when we are asked to answer a question
        - It's very important that we go back in the text
        -  We're back to number two
        - You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  There's where STUDENT found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it
        - They would have to use a combination of all those things
        -  But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use
        -  And what we can do with the water once they found it
        - but they didn't say, full of water
        -  You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting
        - A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon
        -  Sometimes
        - I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested
        - I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading
        - but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon
        -  So, that is right, STUDENT
        - They do need a lot of equipment to get there
        -  But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process
        -  You know, a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters
        - However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text
        -  You're right
        -  The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?
        - I just want to kind of add some detail to it
        -  They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable
        - Yeah, they definitely need space suits to be in space, but I think they might have used a specific tool in the text to see if there is water on the moon
        - But what we're looking for is more of what's in the text
        -  So talking about the microscope or the lunar
        - However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading
        - But in your answer
        -  Does that make sense
        -  I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon
        -  But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon
        -  And they definitely do need to use a microscope
        - Uh huh
        -  Yeah
        -  Does that make sense
        - But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part
        - This did use a lot of equipment like you said what you use your background knowledge, instead of the evidence from the text that you were supposed to eat like I wanted
        -  And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water
        - STUDENT, you had a great response
        -  So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us
        -  It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for
        - With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough
        -  Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay
        - And based on your answer
        -  STUDENT I remember in your response
        - Like STUDENT talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text
        -  But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text
        -  You, you talked about how they use equipment
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good
        - And STUDENT, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks
        -  So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage
        -  But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions
        - Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading
        - And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind
        - But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it
        - but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered
        -  What
        -  But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water
        - You use those
        -  I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question
        -  However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find
        - They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon
        -  So we did use that, STUDENT
        -  You're totally right about that one
        - That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like STUDENT, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic
        - But they never said they need to use a microscope
        -  Remember
        -  But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope
        - Okay, so let's start with you
        -  STUDENT So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon
        -  So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks
        -  They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage
        - but I just -did you -this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used
        - So did you have questions about the passage?
        - I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely like did you did you have questions about it?
        - Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?
        - Because we want to make sure that when you are working
        -  Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of
        - and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as STUDENT in this case
        - So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know
        - I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading
        - You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then
        - Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right
        - that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just
        - Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says
        - um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object
        - person it's really great job i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert
        -  Does that make sense to you
        -  I want to know that you understood the reading that we did
        - But I want to know
        - But I'm a little bit concerned that you're not finding the answers in the text
        -  If you'd like to follow along with me
        - Teacher : But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks, but it does say in part number two
        - I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water
        - So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading
        - That's an important information and it's good to know what is a microscope, a microscope and but there is another equipment that they use in the beginning for this Discovery
        -  Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it
        - Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question we focus on what we see in the reading
        - I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like STUDENT said is microscopic
        - I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned
        - That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon
        - You know there's actually very little water really on the moon
        - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text
        - but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,
        - or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth
        - I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye
        -  Okay?
        - That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it
        -  It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water
        - that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?
        - So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,
        - right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it
        - but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water
        - You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it
        - That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters
        - On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope
        - when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size
        - but they didn't they didn't send a microscope up to space okay
        - So in this particular experiment they didn't send that they didn't have people go up
        - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage
        - Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so
        - Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters
        - So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four
        - So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention
        - One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about
- intent: r420.3
  examples: |
        - Can you and STUDENT work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?
        - and we're going to keep our eyes open
        - I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text STUDENT
        - so, can you look at the text STUDENT and see what the machine does
        - awesome so STUDENT, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay Luis i'm ready for you
        - awesome well STUDENT I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis
        - At least here in this case so STUDENT and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment
        - So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word
        - So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example STUDENT yeah
        - who remembers when STUDENT asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that Chris do you have a  question
        -  STUDENT
        -  So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, yes
        - Okay guys, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water
        -  But let's look back
        - It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something
        - Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage
        -  Okay
        - And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment
        - So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable
        -  Can everybody look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be
        - So, STUDENT I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable
        -  It's important
        -  Can you do that
        - so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable
        - Can you go back in the text and look for specific equipment that they use
        - and maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water
        -  Okay
        - So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?
        - Um, how can I say maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use
        - So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,
        -  I think the article talks about being able to find water and
        - Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there
        -  You have a question
        - That's okay
        -  So that's one of the great things that we can do, since we're in a class in a learning environment, we can use our skills to reread some articles and we can look back and we can try to find these details if you give me one moment STUDENT yes def
        -  That's okay
        - Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question
        -  Once you try it
        -  The first thing is to always find evidence in the text
        - And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that
        - Okay, STUDENT, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and
        -  Can someone see what they brought
        - Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate
        -  Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it
        - So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six
        - So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question
        - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine
        -  When we find,
        - Yeah, the reading and the question
        - You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words
        -  And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again
        -  So equipment
        -  So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read
        -  So like this question
        -  So go back to all the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,
        -  This help discover water on the moon
        - So what equipment
        - Okay, so next time we need to read it again
        -  Okay? So we understand clearly what are the tools that they are using and the equipment
        -  Can we do that
        -  I want you to underline two things and raise your hand
        -  Once you're done
        -  And if you want to amaze me
        -  I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back
        - I want everyone to do that for me
        -  So when we find evidence, what do we have to do with that evidence
        -  Alright, start thinking about detectives
        -  So we have to be detectives
        -  There's an "I" word in the article, you find it?
        -  Right
        - But, and so when we have evidence
        - Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with
        -  Let's see if you guys can reread and find what
        - So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things
        -  And he says,
        - What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together
        - STUDENT, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water
        -  Okay then
        - I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you
        -  Go ahead and look back
        -  So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that STUDENT aright, Farrah and Oliveron
        - But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it
        - So you keep you look down and you read about the
        -  I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does
        - Did you find so in the text
        - Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers
        - But look in your text STUDENT
        -  And look, just a few more words
        -  What did they call this small machine
        - Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource
        - So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water
        -  Okay
        - specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water
        - Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about
        - You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water
        -  Something they used
        - Although might have some other knowledge
        -  Let's look at specifically at the reading
        - So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for
        -  Maybe in one of the headings or sub headings
        - So look back on your article and look for that word valuable
        -  Do you see it anywhere in there
        -  Right
        - Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon
        - Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?
        -  Okay?
        - Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space
        - But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water
        -  Okay
        - Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it
        -  Would you like to maybe give it another go
        -  Scientists found on the moon
        - Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water
        - So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we all to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon STUDENT's answer that he gave us
        - Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question
        - Okay
        -  Well, I appreciate your honesty
        -  So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question
        - So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment
        - Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is
        -  What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
        -  That is perfect
        -  I love that synonym STUDENT, you are spot on
        -  Absolutely
        - A tool
        -  So if you guys could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools
        -  So I see a lot of hands going up
        -  I'm going to give everybody a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see
        - Okay, I see some hands going up
        -  STUDENT What equipment or tools did you find in the text?
        -  And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon
        - I want you guys to first think about equipment or like STUDENT said tools that would be used
        -  So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon
        -  Those space
        -  But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon
        -  Oh, we've already get some ideas
        - Helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon
        -  Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools
        -  STUDENT, what do you see what do you think?
        - So let's look back in the text
        -  I want you guys to focus on some key words
        -  So I want you guys to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words
        - To find water that's absolutely right
        - That are equipment
        - Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that
        - Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text
        - Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text
        -  I want everyone to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph
        -  Excellent job
        -  Thank you
        - All right, stop right there for me, STUDENT
        -  And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover
        -  Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph
        - Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick
        -  STUDENT?
        -  Why don't the three of you go back together and Underline in the text important things that water can be used for the astronauts can use it for
        -  Um, well, STUDENT, Oliver and Chris
        - Okay
        -  Now that we've kind of talked about the paragraphs that our information is in STUDENT found hers in four Luis found his in five
        - So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage
        -  I'll give you about two minutes
        -  Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that
        - I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it
        -  What is that
        -  It tells you what we need to be able to see this
        - And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line
        - Now the next step
        -  All right
        -  Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question
        -  I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question
        -  I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important
        - And while each of you had really good thought processes
        - Alright guys so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion
        - So, STUDENT, if you would
        -  And if you don't, what is mentioned
        -  Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned
        - So I want you to look for that STUDENT look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon
        - I want you to find in the text where it talks about the water being so small that you have to use that kind of told hey
        -  There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text
        - No if you remember back in the article
        - See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question
        - So let's look at paragraph two, and see what other tool we need
        - Orbiter
        -  So you can talk about your background knowledge
        -  I know that you understand what we're talking about
        -  Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way
        - But in this particular text
        -  So maybe next time
        -  We're learning about one specific thing
        -  If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay
        - Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me
        - So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them
        - So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water
        - Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question
        - But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place
        - or ask a question if you're confused and um because STUDENT also
        - and for your response STUDENT, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph
        - To see the exact equipment they used
        - You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used
        - Similar to STUDENT, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use,
        - If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers
        - So if you guys are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text
        - So for the three of you STUDENT Jazmin and Luis when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind
        - And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water
        - so STUDENT I want you to go back and look for anything that in the passage that the passage reads not any information that you know from outside just specifically in the passage that water can be valuable to us
        -  So um that can be useful useful helpful something any kind of detail
        - But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage
        - So I want you to so as I just said to STUDENT and to all of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful
        - drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence
        -  STUDENT what's up
        - Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses
        - I want you to look at paragraph 2 again
        - Just pause for a second, I don't want you to read it, I want you to look at it and then try to interpret that into a sentence like STUDENT did
        - So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see in the reading - equipment listed
        - So when you look at paragraph two and three you're going to try to see keywords that may make a microscope and lunar orbiter two different types of equipment
        -  Does that make sense? so why don't you do that for one minute
        - And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading
        - You had what they discovered, but can you help me
        -  Look for examples of how they discovered it in the reading and you may use some examples that STUDENT or Farrah and Oliver had but let's let's figure it out together
        - But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading all three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used
        - and try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay
        - Alright STUDENT will Jazmin you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline
        - that's what that would be a good start so again my same suggestion, think about the question think of it in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading
        - Perfect all right now I want you to do the same thing and go back and do the reading again and I want you to pull out another one okay
        - I want you all to take 35 seconds, and I want you to reread the reading, but I want you, while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading Okay, and try and make it stuff that you haven't already talked about near responses okay
        - I want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay
        - In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer
        - so let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important clues that might tell us right away what the answer is
        - it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover
        - Alright, so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you guys each a highlighter and you are going to be read the section
        - The second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable
        - And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does anybody have any questions before we start
        - So now i'm giving your highlighters you're going to go through those sex that section that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon anybody have any questions before we start that
        - yep so the microscope and the Lunar orbiter were definitely use, but I want you to go through the text yourself, and I want you to make sure that you can find yourself where that came from and what the evidence is to support that in the text
        - Yeah, next time that would be really great
        -  You want to make sure that when you're reading a text, you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to it as possible
        - I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you guys a minute to do that
        - All right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned
        - Can you find the sentence that STUDENT just talked about when it talks specifically about the Lunar Orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for all of you
        - I want you to read through the passage and just and see if you can find another example of an equipment that was before the microscope that helped us know that we even should be using a microscope to look very small bits of water
        -  Okay
        -  Can you do that for me
        - I also want you to be more of a detective and look to see if there's any other equipment that you see
        -  You take your time you reread it, see if you want to add anything, because I think there might be other pieces of equipment too
        - Yep
        - Can you be a detective right now, and maybe find that tool for me
        - Can you go back and look to see if you see a specific equipment that's mentioned
        - If you're not sure what should I do you can do is go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name
        - So why don't you go back and reread the text to see if there's any way that having more space would be good
        - Now you can use the words you circled "equipment" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there
        -  Okay?
        -  I think in the middle the passage
        - Yes, let's
        -  And so you can look carefully in the passage to see where is the equipment
        -  You can take a carefully look
        -  A lot
        - Okay, so I want you right now to reread the first or the article
        -  Is that clear?
        -  Reread article, and I want you to circle, any word that you might think is equipment
        -  So why don't we try to combine those two answers
        - So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit
        -  The scientists use in order to complete this mission
        - Let's revisit our text and figure out what specifically what equipment or scientific tool
        - Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and read for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon
        - but I, what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the text and look for specifically a piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the reading and read closely the part where they talk about
        -  So I want you to go back and try and find that machine
        - Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use
        - So, that's awesome
        -  Okay
        -  But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        -  Because at first I will read something and we'll think will think it's a big crater, because it is a big crater, but then we'll have to talk about our thoughts of it
        - Yeah, that's why sometimes we have to talk about our thoughts
        - And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading
        -  And we're going to make some annotations on our work
        -  So today, what would I want you to underline is where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer
        - So that means we're going to underline things that we find
        -    And think about if there were any other tools that were used
        - I'm going to have you look at this paragraph again
        - So we want to find what it says in the reading
        - Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question
        -  I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer
        - Now that you've been able to add to your answer
        - I see
        -  So when you read your paragraph again I want you to think about what exactly this paragraph is talking about
        -  So
        - Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different
        - For you STUDENT, what I want you to do is try again look at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that
        - So I think we need to do a little bit more digging into the reading and maybe we can look and see if it shows says anywhere in our reading what equipment was used
        -  STUDENT and look and see if you see anything about equipment
        - So maybe you could go back in the text
        - So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text
        -  You can go back in the text
        - Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that
        -  And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were An equipment used to discover the water, let's take a minute because that is the question
        - When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question
        - And I love what you did with number two, but maybe you can do that with paragraph three, and maybe you can do it with paragraph one
        - So then I would love for you to go back to one and two
        - Look for cluse within the text that have a ding ding ding And I give you a signal for a scientific tool
        -  So reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment
        -  Okay
        -  And it's okay for you to circle some words that might help
        - Yes
        -  Yes, then
        - You can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two,
        - And see if you can find more tools at the scientists use
        - And find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or I guess I can help you
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        -  STUDENT, so I want us to go back and reread the text, and I want you to look for the action where discover because I think that that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a minute to go back into the text
        - Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer
        - Oh, STUDENT, you're absolutely right
        -  The word discover isn't here
        -  But I want you to look
        -  Actually, I'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for a discover
        - And a word that might have a similar meaning
        -  And so I'm going to have you look back in paragraph two,
        - I want to see if we can identify  This this different equipment, because none of us wrote this for our answer
        - So we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the key words
        - In our question before we write our answers
        -  Does that make sense, STUDENT
        -  So I want you to go back and reread And look for the word valuable, it can be really helpful friends when we pick out a certain word in our question and we try to go back into our reading and find it in order to find the right answer
        - So I want us to go back in the text and look for the word valuable because that's one of the words that's in our question
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        -  So I think the key to answering this question after looking at it and determining
        - That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource
        -  So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability
        - So I want us to go back and into our reading and find more example
        - Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on
        -  So I want us to go back into the text
        - I want us to look for examples explicitly stated examples in the text
        - Great guess that's definitely true, but I would like you STUDENT to reread paragraph two, and try to circle words equipment words that maybe that specific piece of equipment itself was what was used to discover the water okay
        - But, you know, something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles and these titles and subtitles can give you more information about about the main ideas of the text
        -  Read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time
        - Yeah
        -  I'm going to give you guys two minutes to read the text
        - Okay, so that's what I want you to think about when you go back into the text
        - Two minutes and read and just and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but I want a sentence for out of everybody for a revised answer
        - So I suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again
        -  Can you do that for me
        - So go back to the checks and look for that
        -  Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used
        - STUDENT
        - But I think I want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar Lunar Orbiter
        -  Well, yes, STUDENT
        -  Okay, so read a little bit more, and maybe take some time to underline some key words in your Texts
        - and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can
        - Okay STUDENT so in the text on do you um I so either i'm going to have you can you please read over the text, and try to find what that machine is called and then i'm going to if you have it right now
        - So maybe not literally looking very close at the reading, but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to
        - you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts, and we are looking for equipment, specifically, and I would like, for everyone to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly
        - i'd like for everyone to write down say two things
        - How much water they had too so STUDENT you can go back and then look at how much water their own says they have found I think they say that okay
        - could you guys look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph
        - STUDENT i'm wondering if you to take another look because i'm hearing about some really interesting tools from your classmates
        - That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the
        - I would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery
        - Being an astronaut and you're, of course, they have to have oxygen tanks, so in this question or in this particular case, we want to try to use evidence from the text right so that's why I want to do I want you to take a second STUDENT
        - But we want to also find out how they find the water and circle, something that would let you know that okay
        -  So what do you think I want you to dig a little bit deeper into the text, what do you think help them to get to the point where they could use the microscope
        - When you have the microscope there you're like okay Now I know exactly what i'm looking at right so, but we have to get to the moon
        - And then bring it in some right so again same direction as STUDENT looking at text and see if you can find out how they were able to get it down narrowed the space down small enough to use the microscope Jazmin
        -  yes ma'am I see your hand
        - I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific
        - hold on one second even and I noticed that everybody has to work on one specific thing, and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it
        - So what I like to do when i'm reading a scientific text is create a visual of what's going on, so I know that I have the moon, and have just told us that the moon has going to have a North Pole and a South pole
        - So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us
        - Great let's go back to our visualization
        - Yes, absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text
        -  Okay?
        - Here and underlined, a sentence where
        - and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon
        - So what you can do my feedback for you is that you could just read every time you read a passage and the questions given to you, I want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me
        - what's what's missing from here what's the information that's missing here
        - can we look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was
        - and maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable
        - yeah yeah look in the text and find find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable
        - You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money
        - so maybe you guys can go with the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic
        - so I would want all of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery
        - Do you remember that part of the article I wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding
        - But I want you to really make sure that you're looking to answer the specific question so STUDENT if you can go back to the text, and I want you to really look very carefully
        - would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon
        - Okay, and when you find it go ahead and just circle circle what you think that's speaking to that Okay, and then
        - What the text is saying, but it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds
        -  Use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words
        -  Thank you, STUDENT
        - awesome
        - Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me
        - So i'm going to go back and check in with STUDENT about what he's working on it, will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about
        - To see what they see what they were looking for so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this the phrase that would help you make that connection between what the Lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph
        - So just go back and read the passage really quick
        - Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay STUDENT do you have a question
        - so go back to the text and see try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovering water on the moon
        - Fine yeah yeah so to find think about that general idea and see if you could find to go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover the not necessarily discover
        - Alright, so might be an option to look at right, but maybe I want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water amen
        - I want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it
        - so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two
        - so go ahead and underline The specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now
        - And not discovery process, so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it, but finding it in the first place
        - so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery
        - Is thinking specifically about how they discovered water on the moon
        - Looking specifically for that context that's a really great question STUDENT, thank you
        - astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space, so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using
        - Alright, so, And I should have said this when you're reading but let's try to look for tools in this paragraph
        - I want you to maybe take a minute, while I go speak to some of our other friends and see if you can look over the passage and see what equipment was mentioned in the passage
        - Alright, so I want you to think about that, while I go ahead and talk to my other friends and I want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage
        - Okay, maybe we can look at the text a little bit more, I think I saw a little bit of a clue it's a small machine and we can find that in the text can everyone look and see if they can find that sentence of the text, a small machine
        - so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two, to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay
        - So take a look at paragraph two, and see if you can find that tool
        - So my suggestion for both of you delve, too, is that you reread paragraph two, and maybe some of three and to really understand what tool is being used to first find the water before they use the microscope
        - so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two, there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works
        - Right, but if we really want to know how did they find it in the first place, there is another tool that we can look for in this in this New York Times passage there right and so actually for you and STUDENT
        - so let's take a look my suggestion, again, is that we take a look at this paragraph two, because there is there's another tool that was used in order to find the water, even before they could see it
        - um suggesting that water could be valuable, so my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph, for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason, maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful, even if it isn't right now
        - My suggestion is similar to STUDENT and Farrah you take a look at paragraph four, and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there
        - STUDENT You also spoke about paragraph five, so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find and why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship
        - Also right now STUDENT Chris reread paragraph four to find out why would it be better on the moon
        - Right and we haven't mentioned moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five, to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon
        - Because most of the articles about equipment that they used how they found it, so I would reread and do a little ranking and sorting of the evidence that I find
        - So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use
- intent: r130.2
  examples: |
        - awesome awesome okay STUDENT and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks
        - STUDENT are you are you on board with that
        - now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes STUDENT
        - awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon? Yes, STUDENT
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead STUDENT
        - yeah and when you're done why don't you and STUDENT talk about Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people
        - yeah STUDENT and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis
        -  STUDENT
        - So what investigate mean does anybody know
        - So did anybody say like a title?
        - What do astronauts use it for STUDENT
        - is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource STUDENT
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and STUDENT work together since you were you had the same answer
        - And you can talk about it
        -  Okay
        -  And I'm going to speak with STUDENT for a moment
        - STUDENT, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used
        - And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use
        -  Did you circle, those two words
        - STUDENT
        - Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and STUDENT and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope
        -  I want you guys to look back at your reading passage
        - and if you finish before I come back to you
        -  Go ahead and work on the next question
        - I wonder, maybe STUDENT can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer
        - STUDENT, would you agree with what Oliver said?
        - So let's hop back to STUDENT for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question
        -  So let's talk with STUDENT and see if we can work together on that one
        - Let's see if we can figure it out because STUDENT had the same answer is you
        -  Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to STUDENTs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay that's a great question
        -  Okay STUDENT What do you think?
        - Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that
        -  Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?
        - STUDENT, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with Chris, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry
        - Okay STUDENT are you able to help?
        -  And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover
        - Perfect, yeah
        - STUDENT what did you get
        - Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines
        -  But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q
        -  What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - Okay, perfect
        -  So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        -  You guys look at that together
        - Perfect
        -  How about STUDENT and Farrah
        -  Okay
        -  Awesome
        - How about you and STUDENT kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        - How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer
        -  If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three
        - So maybe STUDENT and Jazmin
        -  I think that may help if you reread that okay
        - What do you think, STUDENT, what do you feel about what Luis said?
        - Um, to kind of build off that STUDENT
        -  Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here
        -  But what was the microscope attached to? Help STUDENT out
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, STUDENT, and I appreciate your feedback
        -  So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?
        - Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and STUDENT, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah
        - Not really, but that's a good guess
        -  STUDENT, what do you got?
        -  I'm Question you
        - Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses
        -  STUDENT
        -  But we're still missing the point
        -  What do you got?
        - Awesome
        -  Does anyone else have a different response than STUDENT
        -  And then why your elbow partner agrees with you
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from STUDENT, and why you found what you found
        - Would anyone else like to build on his response
        -  I want to see what you two can come up with together
        - Why don't STUDENT, you talk with Jazmin
        - Okay
        -  STUDENT and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer
        -  I would like for the four of you, and STUDENT can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with
        - So, STUDENT was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope
        -  So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers
        - To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, STUDENT Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you
        -  The Lunar Orbiter
        -  What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you
        -  So if you got the right answer
        - And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group
        -  What might help your friend
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think STUDENT
        -  What do you think
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        -  Maybe we'll discover it together
        -  Okay
        -  Let's work together to see if we can find this answer
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together
        - So let me see
        -  Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together
        - and let's see class
        -  They found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement
        - so let's see who can add to that
        - Okay
        -  So eventually I think should go along with what STUDENT said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - So you and STUDENT you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out
        -  So you think that you could work with STUDENT?
        - So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon
        - See if you can look in your text and you and STUDENT can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too
        -  yes STUDENT
        - And I'm sure that STUDENT and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool
        - Do we agree with her answer
        - What could, Can somebody help STUDENT
        - Did we read about that
        -  STUDENT?
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out
        - Can somebody help
        - STUDENT, can you help him out there?
        - STUDENT?
        - can anybody or STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me
        - Does the rest talk with STUDENT about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        -  I think you have the answer
        -  So, talk with STUDENT and help him discover which one it is
        - Good
        -  So, STUDENT
        -  So what did STUDENT, you say about the water
        - So then STUDENT Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon
        -  Do you want to answer
        -  STUDENT's question
        - STUDENT
        - Okay, well let's ask your other classmates
        - So let's break it up into groups STUDENT and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and Luis
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - Group members, while the first person is sharing
        -  So we're going to start with STUDENT, you will be our first person to share
        - You are just listening to them
        - Debbie will be the second STUDENT, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer
        -  And then, STUDENT
        -  So, STUDENT, if you will go first
        -  I'll tell you when when to start
        - After that, okay, so you'll share with the group STUDENT
        -  Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can
        - So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  Also, do you have something else to say
        -  Do you agree
        -  Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is everybody else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words
        - All right
        - So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource
        -  Okay
        -  So, STUDENTon Farrah
        -  You guys and STUDENT can work together and Jazmin and Luis You can work together
        - So just paragraph four or five and six
        - Anybody can answer
        -  Okay
        - How about STUDENT and Oliver show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well
        -  That's a claim that STUDENT said, right Luis?
        - Very good
        - Well, let me, let me ask STUDENT, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine
        -  What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help STUDENT with that one
        - Okay so STUDENT You know a lot about space
        -  Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?
        -  So do you guys think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon
        - That's great
        - STUDENT
        -  What did the scientists, fine
        -  And so what did that small machine do? STUDENT, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?
        - Okay, yeah
        - Okay, so STUDENT, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?
        -  Does anybody else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts
        - Yes
        - Okay, so, and STUDENT did you agree with Farrah
        - Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment
        - Yes
        -  Maybe, STUDENT, do you think you can help out Luis?
        -  So, based on what STUDENT just read about a lunar orbiter
        - Oh, okay
        -  Can anyone help STUDENT, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver
        -  So, do you know what paragraph or
        - But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article
        - So what do you think about this STUDENT
        - Did you all hear what I said to STUDENT?
        - So does anybody else see any other equipment
        -  Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to
        - Equipment
        -  If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer
        -  Thumbs up if you agree with STUDENT thumbs down
        - Okay
        -  What do you think, do you agree with STUDENT or no
        - Okay everyone, STUDENT
        - Anybody else have a different answer
        -  So we're, we're, we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right
        -  And then STUDENT was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter
        - Teacher:
        - did anybody find a different word than equipment in question one
        -  What's another keyword somebody else found
        - Somebody help STUDENT out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text
        -  And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one
        -  Convincing what? what are we being convinced of
        -  Does anybody have a word to go along with savannas word convincing
        - Yeah so convincing is an important word
        -  What is it convincing
        -  Also convincing
        - Exactly
        -  Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment
        -  So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space
        -  So, STUDENT and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and Jazmin, you can talk
        -  I would like for you to turn to the person beside you
        - Okay, now that you have circled your keywords
        - And then eighth and you can share your answer with me
        -  I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that
        - I want you guys to talk about with that same partner,
        - So, STUDENT and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then Luis You can you can talk with me
        - So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi
        - So, STUDENT and Deb, you can work together
        -  STUDENT and gel together and Luis You can work with me
        -  Okay, so take a couple seconds
        - Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment
        -  So
        -  So you can have what we talked with STUDENT, and Oliver here, right, which, if you don't mind
        - I guess
        -  So STUDENT, do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes?
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Your answer was that NASA send a small machine
        - Does anyone know
        - Does anyone agree or disagree with STUDENT
        - You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way
        -  Does anyone else have any questions before we begin?
        -  STUDENT, what you got to add?
        - We're not entirely there just yet
        - Well, we are absolutely on the right track
        -  STUDENT, what do you have to add?
        - Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about
        - Okay, well let's see what STUDENT and Luis thought as well
        - Okay, that's a really good thought
        -  STUDENT, would you like to go next
        -  I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms
        -  STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - And so let's hear from STUDENT and see what he has to say
        -  Okay
        -  And we'll come together with a group response
        -  You can ask me, but this is what I want you guys to focus on
        - I want you guys to break up into small groups so STUDENT Oliver and Chris and then maybe Jazmin and Luis If you guys will work together for just a little bit
        -  And if you have questions while you're discussing
        -  Well, I know that a couple of you guys had your hand raised
        - Sure
        -  Since you guys may have similar answers
        -  But STUDENT, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help Oliver with his words
        -  If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr STUDENT that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for
        - So
        -  Mm hmm
        - By using what you and Mr STUDENT and Mr Chris, you can talk to
        -  STUDENT and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts
        - Oh, I think it takes, can someone find it
        - Now, now you guys have not, but you guys were so close
        -  So have Mr STUDENT and history
        -  STUDENT out death
        - So what other kinds of equipment would you guys say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope
        - Does anybody have any ideas, STUDENT
        -  STUDENT?
        - Right
        -  So we have a microscope
        -  Did anybody else see anything else in the text that you might use
        - So now we know they have
        -  STUDENT you remember what I tools the scientist used?
        - Is there somebody STUDENT, would you like to help her out
        - Alright and STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me the other item that they needed
        - Okay, so let's continue to look maybe STUDENT can help you out
        - STUDENT, Do you want to try to help her out to
        - Does anybody know what they use you either the hydrogen oxygen for within the water?
        - I had a really good answer um well I I brought you guys, all together, because you guys all had varying answers so i'm hoping that when you guys hear your responses like your classmates responses
        - You can get ideas for them as well, because even the smartest people in the world, work with other people to make things better, because if you can collaborate, then you guys all learn at the same time
        - And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right
        - so maybe as we keep listening, as you heard from STUDENT and we might hear from Oliveron Farrah
        - Okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay
        - so STUDENT is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and, if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add
        - Now STUDENT, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon
        - STUDENT, let's have everyone look first before you share
        -  Anyone besides-- anyone else? STUDENT, what did you come up with?
        - Good job for knowing the answer
        -  Anyone else want to try? STUDENT, do you want to go? Yeah, go ahead
        - I want- before we get into that I want anyone else to share any other equipment they may have circled
        - Anybody else?
        - Okay
        -  Anyone else anyone else have any guesses?
        - So I want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with STUDENT and Oliver
        -  And then STUDENT Jazmin Luis are going to work together, and I want you to compare and contrast the difference between the Lunar orbiter and microscope
        - I want you to do this with a with a small group
        -  So STUDENT and Oliver can do it together and Chris Jazmin Luis can also be a small group, and I want you to circle any equipment, you see, in the reading, that you think is important, and then I want you come back in one minute
        - i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now, I just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you
        -  So I want you to collaborate with them, okay? Thank you for the question
        - Do you guys know what did NASA send to help investigate STUDENT
        - Does anybody in the group remember reading about what they use to find the craters
        - Do you want to add STUDENT, what was the equipment that you had said that may be Luis's thinking about?
        - Does anybody want to help out STUDENT and tell him what the lunar orbiter was
        - STUDENT What do you think, do you agree with death
        -  Does anybody else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right
        - Well, I think you're thinking could benefit everybody else and how you just does everybody
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT
        -  Oh
        - STUDENT What do you think
        - So, STUDENT, what do you think
        - Can anyone help him?
        - Think about what's STUDENT said
        -  Can anyone help him
        - That's okay
        - um to make this a little easier did anybody have any answers that were different from savannas
        - let's see STUDENT did you have anything different today
        - who can raise their hand and what isn't it
        - That STUDENT didn't say, how about Farrah
        -  What did
        -  What did what equipment and I use
        - For the next for the next person who answers
        -  Who agrees with STUDENT who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use
        - I think so
        - Does anybody else have any ideas about tools?
        -  Okay
        -  Does anyone else want to say something real quick
        -  No
        - Think so
        - Awesome
        -  What about STUDENT, what do you think about that
        - That's a good idea
        -  I know
        -  No thought, STUDENT, did you wanna chime in on anything
        - Let me see Does anyone want to help her out or point to where it was in the article
        - Let me see who else I
        - or yeah yeah okay great does anyone else, want to add anything, maybe STUDENT or Chris
        - together
        - About STUDENT can you read yours, and then we can maybe like a grief, we wanted to add something to it, or maybe take something away Okay, so I
        - drink this water does anyone else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing
        - So do you guys agree that that can be very valuable
        - do you agree with STUDENT do you want to add anything or take anything away from it all
        -  STUDENT, can you help us out a little bit? I see you raising your hand
        - Yeah
        - or STUDENT, do you have any suggestions
        - Really smaller exactly
        -   Did anybody else think that while they're reading or see that in the text? STUDENT?
        - All right, so STUDENT and deb why don't you guys work together, while I finish up with everyone else, and you guys can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence, yes Jazmin
        - Who agrees with STUDENT that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        - Well let's look who knows what a lunar STUDENT do you know what a lunar orbiter is?
        - Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?
        - STUDENT, do you agree with that
        - Does anybody remember?
        - Does anybody want to-- STUDENT, do you want some help from a friend?
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?
        - OK
        -  STUDENT, what do you think?
        - Very good, very good
        -  Um, so can you go, or can you turn and asked help from a friend
        - All right, who agrees with STUDENT or Chris, do you have something to say
        - that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did anyone else have any other ideas
        - Does anyone want to jump in?
        - Okay, so you still think that that anyone else that has everyone else's opinion stayed the same, or have they changed
        - Does anyone else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text
        - Actually STUDENT and Luis I think we're going to work together
        -  STUDENT Are you are you with me
        - STUDENT add on
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT make answer stronger
        -  Do people think that
        - What do people think
        - Scientists use the microscope to discover water
        -  Do people think it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Do you agree or disagree
        - STUDENT
        -  What do you think, do you agree with STUDENT endeavor
        -  Do you agree with STUDENT and Luis Why
        - Do you thin they used the microscope
        -  Do you think that they used the lunar orbiter? Why or why not?
        -  What do you guys think the answer is, then
        - What do you guys think
        - Um, what do you guys think about what STUDENT said
        - Do you agree with her thinking, Do you disagree with her thinking why oh
        - STUDENT, make sure that we're raising her hand
        -  What do we think
        - Does anybody want to add some more detail
        -  STUDENT, thank you for raising your hand
        - Do we agree or disagree with STUDENT
        -  Why, raise your hand
        - Would anybody like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is
        -  How did that help them to do this work, STUDENT
        -  Yeah
        - Did anybody else use a strategy, similar to STUDENT or differently to Jazmin, and how did it help them or how did it
        - But except for this Equipment
        -  Can you, can somebody share what is another word that you found that is also important in the question
        - So, STUDENT, and Oliver, how about you two work together and talking to each other
        - And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes
        -  How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out STUDENT and Luis to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right
        - And then STUDENT
        - So if you are going to revise your answer
        -  It may help STUDENT and Luis to understand better
        - You had equipment and anyone else in the group have equipment
        -  Okay
        - Alright, so what I would like us to do next is STUDENT Farrah and Luis I would like to group with you together and Chris and Jazmin, we're gonna work together
        - So you can start working in your small groups
        - STUDENT
        -  Do you agree with STUDENT
        -  What did STUDENT, say, what does it mean
        - You learn the word orbit and STUDENT
        - STUDENT is Oliver right
        - To someone want to try to put that into one answer
        - Did anyone want to add anything to that I can
        -  I still see a hand STUDENT
        -  Go ahead
        -  Yeah, STUDENT
        - Does anyone have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment
        -  And once you're done, you can share with the partner, partner next to you
        - All right
        - See if you guys got the same answers
        - Anybody else find any other piece of equipment
        - You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud
        -  Do you all agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy
        - Yes
        - What do we think folks?
        - nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used
        -  Does that make sense
        - Okay, can you help them out
        -  You guys, what part in
        - So looking at the reading There's another machine that the scientists use did anyone remember what that other machine that they used
        - Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for
        -  And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers
        -  So you're going to share each other's answers
        - So what I'm going to ask you all to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner
        - So let's say STUDENT, if you are working with Chris
        -  You two would share your answers with each other
        -  I'm going to go to each group individually, and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit
        - So as you're working
        -  And then I'm going to go to each of you individually
        - Okay, so go ahead and get started
        -  Does anybody agree
        - That's what I think
        -  Do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon
        -  STUDENT and can someone remind me
        -  Does anyone remember
        - Yes, that's a very good point as well
        -  Does anyone else have an idea, why do we all have different answers
        - Oh, OK
        -  I can see why you think that, but I don't see it that way
        -  We're going to break apart
        - So for the remainder of class we're going to break apart into groups or into part with you
        - STUDENT and Chris work together
        - STUDENT in Luis then work together
        - Awesome
        -  So you're going to share what you found with STUDENT and I'm going to work with Oliver independently, Luis you have a question
        -  Okay
        - You guys have until six o'clock to work with your partner
        - STUDENT, you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now
        - STUDENT and Jazmin should be working together
        - You agree with that
        - Did anyone have a different answer than STUDENT
        - Does anyone did anyone else find other examples, STUDENT
        - STUDENT gave an example, Oliver, do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts
        - Um, I want us to go back in and answer our question again
        -  So does anyone have another example that we could use of
        -  And if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text
        -  If you agree can raise your hand
        - Does anyone agree with STUDENT
        - Would anybody else like to add on STUDENT Chris or Luis to the first question
        - Does anyone else have an answer that they would like to contribute
        - STUDENT Would you like to help Chris
        -  Oh
        - You too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample
        - Evidence
        -  Does anybody agree with STUDENT about evidence or does somebody have a different idea
        -  Thank you
        - Does anyone remember what it's called
        - Can we, can someone remind me of that
        -  Good
        - Equipment
        -  Or if someone else wants to tell me something different
        -  I'm just gonna pull everybody in the class and see if we're on the same page
- intent: r110.4
  examples: |
        - that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine
        - nailed it yes STUDENT high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great
        - Totally You got it
        - Equipment is a great word
        -  Did anybody else put equipment
        -  So that is a great word to underline, did anybody else underline anything else
        - Okay, awesome
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Okay, good
        -  So we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good
        -  Those are both very important
        -  So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?
        - Good
        -  That is exactly right
        -  And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Exactly
        - Discover, that's great
        - That's great
        -  So guys, I want you to think
        -  That's absolutely right
        -  So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So good
        - Yeah, exactly
        - Right, you use it to look at the water
        - Yes
        - Right
        -  Once they found it
        -  It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        -  They did send a small machine
        - Okay, STUDENT, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine
        -  Yes, they did
        - Exactly, yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Yes, it does
        -  You two are correct
        -  It is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So you are right there
        -  And I'm but yes you are
        - It is
        - Very good
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - Just those two pieces of equipment
        -  Okay, wonderful
        - Mm hmm
        - It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it
        -  They did find water on the moon
        - SO let's look there
        -  Yeah you STUDENT
        -  That is correct
        - Right
        -  That is exactly right
        -  That's right
        - Lunar Orbiter
        -  That is the small machine
        -  Okay
        - That's right
        -  I think a lunar orbiter is really key here
        -  Right
        -  Without that sort of orbiter right
        - Absolutely, absolutely
        -  They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon
        - That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and
        - All right, STUDENT, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater
        -  You did very well
        -  That's how they actually examine the water and the craters
        -  It's the Lunar Orbiter
        - That is correct
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        - Very good
        - They could breathe it
        - Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time
        - Yes
        -  Awesome job
        - Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment STUDENT
        -  What else
        - Discover
        -  Okay, good
        - Yes
        - Yes, you're right
        -  Yeah
        - So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that
        - Yes, and you need water to survive
        -  Yes, you're right
        - Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon
        - Okay? NASA sent a small machine
        - Mm hmm
        - Good job
        -  That's right
        - The lunar orbiter
        - Yes
        - Yes, exactly
        - You are exactly right
        - And you're right we so we do need that
        - Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        -  Yes, those are important as well
        - Oh, and move
        -  Yes
        - Exactly right
        - Correct
        -  So
        - I agree
        -  So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important
        -  I know what I mean
        - Good, good, good
        - Good
        -  Okay
        -  It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - and you put it out perfectly
        -  It could be useful in lots of ways
        -  So it could be very important
        - That's correct
        - That's exactly right
        - A lunar orbiter
        -  So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating
        - Yeah
        -  So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter
        - What's right
        - Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable
        -  Correct
        - STUDENT you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore
        - You are correct
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Correct
        -  So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment
        -  Let me hear from STUDENT Chris, what were you gonna say
        - OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone
        - Exactly
        - Yeah, so that's that's the small machine
        -  They sent
        - Exactly
        -  It's discovering water on the moon
        - A lunar orbiter
        - Excellent
        -  So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter
        - Investigated
        - Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large
        - Polar crater
        -  Okay
        - So they were really small
        -  That is excellent
        - Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon
        - Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water
        -  That's exactly right
        -  So,
        - A tool
        -  Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment
        - That's right
        - Yeah, a lunar orbiter
        -  So you're absolutely right
        -  So,
        - Yeah
        -  No, you're right
        -  STUDENT that
        - I think you, you're absolutely right
        -  It is find water
        -  Okay
        - Absolutely
        -  So we can use water as rocket fuel
        - Very good
        - Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel
        -  I do believe that that is a correct answer
        -  So, good job there,
        - That's wonderful
        - Yes, NASA used a small machine
        - that would also count as a piece of equipment
        -  Right
        - Very well
        -  So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said
        - So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine
        -  They do need oxygen
        -  That is true
        - so STUDENT you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Very good, very good
        -  Mm hmm
        - Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found
        - Right
        - They actually use that to find it
        -  Yeah
        - Exactly
        - Exactly, exactly
        -  So you're right
        -  They do need a small machine and,
        -  I just mentioned with STUDENT right that water is heavy
        - Exactly and STUDENT, you got you got to that part
        -  So
        - Lunar Orbiter
        -  This is the
        -  Right
        -  Correct
        -  That's what we were looking for
        - Correct
        - Awesome
        -  Alright, so, STUDENT was back in the story, and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter
        -  So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon
        -  Alright so next time
        - Awesome
        - yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen
        - Alright perfect awesome
        - Right
        - right there you go STUDENTon or Oliver
        - awesome job STUDENT
        - Yes, which you did, so awesome
        - amazing that is just what I was looking for
        - I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um
        - awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for
        - Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome
        -  STUDENT, yes
        - Yep
        -  So that is the equipment
        - Yes
        - Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect
        - That's right
        - I think you've convinced me
        - Yes, that's a great example STUDENT, thank you for explaining that to us
        - Yes, that's a great example, thank you STUDENT for that
        - Yes, lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, there you go
        - So, that's awesome
        - and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and
        - It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter
        - Good
        -  So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have,
        -  So great job
        -  The equipment was used to find water on the moon
        - So yes, that is one of the answers to that
        - yeah that is correct
        - I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go
        -  So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter
        - That's right
        - Exactly
        - That was a perfect response
        - Yes, perfect
        - Good job, STUDENT
        -  Great job
        - Perfect
        - The microscope
        -  Great job
        -  STUDENT
        -  Great job, STUDENT
        - Perfect
        - Perfect
        -  Great job, STUDENT
        -  Great
        - A lunar orbiter
        - Nice
        -  Good job
        - Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Correct
        - Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon
        - We already had the Lunar orbiter part
        - In the craters
        - To find water on the moon, and because
        - Again STUDENT kind of touched on it and her answer
        - To look at the water
        - Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer
        -  So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters
        - There you go
        -  So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon
        - They did
        -  You're right
        -  So you have the lunar
        - Awesome
        - Yeah, exactly
        -  Thank you for sharing STUDENT, so the water was found in this craters
        -  Okay, great, great job
        -  Okay
        - Yeah
        - Yes, you are right
        - Great
        -  So the small machine is the lunar
        - Yeah, your right
        -  Your right
        - Yes, you are
        - All right, the lunor orbiter
        - Yes
        - Yes, you are right
        -  Right
        -  So the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens
        - Yes
        - Yeah, correct
        -  STUDENT So the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Nice work, STUDENT
        - Yes
        -  That's exactly right
        - They still had to use it
        -  Correct
        -  Yes STUDENT
        - Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Yes
        -  Nice job, STUDENT
        -  Good work
        -  That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon
        - Yeah, exactly
        - Exactly
        - Yeah, that's absolutely correct
        -  So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water
        - Yeah, that's exactly right, STUDENT
        -  Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom
        -  So, um, you're right
        -  STUDENT It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Oh, STUDENT
        - You're off to a good start, like how you said he's a word from the story
        -  STUDENT
        -  I agree, it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is
        -  Thank you
        - Thank you for that answer
        -  I agree
        -  STUDENT
        -  I think equipment is an important word to focus on in
        - Yes, thank you
        -  Thank you STUDENT for contributing that and for answering my question
        - That's the answer that I was looking for
        -  There is there is something new for us
        -  We didn't know that we can get water on the moon
        - Yeah, you are correct
        -  Thank you for for responding
        - Yeah definitely is very important
        - Or good STUDENT I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you
        -  You're correct
        -  So, good job
        -  I think we're getting to the right place
        -  Thank you for letting me
        - Awesome
        - And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um
        - So the answer for STUDENT was correct one right
        -   STUDENT
        - Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think
        - Part Three okay
        - Oh that's a great answer STUDENT
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter
        - that's correct that's correct very good STUDENT
        - Exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter
        - yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools
        - yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use
        - yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great
        - Yeah, but you know it
        - Yes, the ice is so small
        - Great work
        -  STUDENT
        -  what do you want to add?
        - yeah great conclusion
        - yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword,
        - I think you're right, I think you do,
        - I like that, so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need
        - Okay equipment to discover water and STUDENT
        - Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight STUDENT Luis and Oliver I think y'all were spot on
        - equipment whoa that's really great
        - lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment
        - equipment and discover or two great words
        - awesome okay yeah I know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool
        - that's right, so we have the name of the Lunar orbiter
        - Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,
        - that's perfect Thank you STUDENT, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what Jazmin just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question Farrah or maybe something you want to add
        - No that's a great point STUDENT I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text
        - I think that STUDENT just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future 
        - yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job
        - Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good all right
        - Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes
        - You are correct STUDENT it does mean really, really small
- intent: r210.4
  examples: |
        - Do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?
        - yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know
        - I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?
        - yeah and what does the machine call
        - tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in
        - And what form so so, is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't
        - What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came
        - That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment, but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right
        - did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water
        - awesome STUDENT and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.
        - awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon
        - yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that
        - yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do STUDENT what is the machine doing
        - They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it
        - So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right
        - So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called
        - So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together
        - So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you guys want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  And while I'm reading, we are looking for
        - We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you
        - So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay
        -  So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it
        -  Okay
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        -  If you were looking straight at it
        -  The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely
        -  So what is that microscope, helping them do guys
        -  So what is the name of that machine called?
        -  This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        -  So let's look back and see if we can find it
        - Because it's in our passage
        -  So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        -  So
        -  So let's read the sentence
        -  But let's look back and see what that's called
        -  Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Yes, the small machine
        - Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?
        -  Does anyone know what discover means?
        - So you have to find the water before you can look at it right
        -  Before we can look at it
        -  And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it
        - Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first
        - Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water
        - If we look at number two
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        -  These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?
        - Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text
        -  What equipment did they use?
        - So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and
        - Let's go back into the texts and look
        - It says it in the text
        -  If we go back and look
        - In the text
        - Go back and look what's another word that we can use STUDENT
        -  All right
        -  And what was the name of that machine
        - Yes, a small machine
        - So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use
        - The water on the main for
        - What do astronauts use the water for
        -  So why is it a valid valuable
        - But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source
        -  So resource
        -  What does it say
        - All right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater
        -  I think right?
        - Yes, and that's where they found it
        -  That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits
        -  So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters
        -  I guess it was really cold the
        - It landed on the moon South Pole
        -  So tell me, just reading our passage STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment
        -  Great
        - So you underlined equipment and discover
        -  Did the scientists discover water on the moon with
        - but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small
        -  So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there
        - Very small
        -  Yes STUDENT
        -  We also read in paragraph three
        - That word could that's in the second sentence
        -  Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways
        - So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful
        -  And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?
        - Let's stop for a second
        -  Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?
        - Okay
        - Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?
        - Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it
        - Okay that is moisture
        -  But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon
        -  We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that
        -  Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink
        - Okay
        - In paragraph three, what does it say about
        - When, when it says we're not able to see it
        - What does it say right after that
        -  Can't wait
        -  So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that
        -  Yes
        -  We can see that there's something in our glass
        - Good
        - So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here
        -  Do you know have you turned before naked eye
        -  We can't see it with our naked eye
        -  Yeah
        - Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater
        -  So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small
        - So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that
        -  Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water
        - Yes
        -  Did it say that it was there
        - So they can be found
        -  But this passage was only talking about
        - Right
        -  So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen
        - What they found on the moon
        - The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want all of you to look in paragraph three
        - What does it say about the water in paragraph three
        - So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see
        - If you look in paragraph to
        - The fourth sentence
        -  Can you look down at the four sentence
        - My cup right here is 30 ounces
        - Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which
        - I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass
        - so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find
        - That answer
        -  NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine
        - Okay, and STUDENT, you are correct
        -  Did anybody see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph
        - Okay
        - A lunar orbiter is doing a different job
        -  They called a lunar orbiter to what?
        - Did they discover water with the microscope?
        - Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second
        -  They didn't talk to anyone on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues
        - So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues
        -  And what did they find with the lunar orbiter
        -  Discovering orbiting, looking around
        -  Used to investigate
        - A lunar orbiter
        - STUDENT remind me what investigating means again
        - Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon
        - They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water STUDENT
        - STUDENT, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water
        - Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading
        -  Was there any other equipment that they've talked about
        - What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope
        - What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?
        -  They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called
        - And you are exactly right
        - Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called
        - Okay
        -  How many of you guys were looking for the word water in the in the passage
        - So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water
        -  So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, STUDENT?
        - And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small
        -  So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there
        - So let's look back in the text
        -  Now let's go back and look at that text
        - Exactly, exactly
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So it is asking in the text field like back in the text
        -  There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right
        -  So do you think the microscope to help them
        -  Look for water while they're physically on the moon
        - Right, exactly
        -  So if you look in the text
        - Right
        -  This is it
        -  They use the lunar orbiter right
        - And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water
        -  See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon
        -  STUDENT
        -  Yeah
        - So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment
        - They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water
        - And then we're looking for what?
        - Well, they were looking for water on the moon
        -  Right
        - And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water
        -  So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer
        - and, let me read this, um, you said, it, STUDENT, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?
        - Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely
        -  What do you think that they need to look things really closely
        - Yes, that's amazing
        -  Right
        -  So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small
        - For example, why do you think that they you a microscope
        - If you read the text again
        - Let's get even a little more basic there
        -  So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?
        - Very good, very good
        -  I'm glad you're seeing it
        -  So let's take a look back, STUDENT noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us
        -  So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,
        -  Right
        -  What makes it very interesting to read
        - But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory
        - While there is some water there
        -  It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water
        - Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes
        -  So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right
        -  So we know that they're kind of the subject
        -  They're kind of who this article was talking about, right
        - And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon
        -  Correct?
        - But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters
        - Once you take a quick glance at it
        - what did they find these with
        -  But what is the text tell you about it
        - Right
        -  And what's the small machine called
        - That is correct
        -  Okay, NASA send a small machine
        - It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax
        -  I'm going to help you read it
        -  So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you
        - Right
        -  And what is it called,
        - And what does it say about water can be split into
        - Bob, what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in
        - Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if everyone will look back at the second paragraph
        - Discovered yes yes now STUDENT, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water
        -  Later on they can study deeper
        - Into the water right they want to look closely at it
        -  And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a
        - Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment
        - Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment
        -  But what is the microscope helping scientists do
        - Yes, so they are using a microscope
        - Right
        -  So
        -  That is correct
        -  So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about
        - And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper
        - And where did you find that out in the passage
        - Okay, so who can tell me about the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Go back to paragraph two
        - STUDENT, can you tell me about the lunar orbiter
        -  STUDENT, you go ahead and look at paragraph two
        - What does it say STUDENT about the Lunar Orbiter
        - The ice deposits are very small
        - So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?
        - Okay
        -  Does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph?
        -  What do you think the word investigate means
        - Let's go back to paragraph two, once more, it does say NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  Once you find it, what else? What else you're going to want to know about it
        -  So what are you going to find about it
        - So if you're investigating something you're finding something
        -  So yes, STUDENT?
        -  Okay
        - You're going to want to know what it is
        -  We have to find it and then study it, STUDENT, what do you want to add
        - Exactly
        -  And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine
        - Today I would like for all of you to look back at paragraph number two
        -  So what did
        -  What did NASA send to investigate
        - Okay that sentence
        - Okay, so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me
        -  Yes STUDENT
        - Okay so ice and water
        -  Is that the same thing
        - Exactly
        -  The very first thing some paragraph to NASA send a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So if we will let's underline that sentence on number two
        - And then the second sentence underline that one as well
        -  This lunar orbiter will land at the most South Pole and look for ice deposits
        -  OK, now let's go on to the third paragraph so
        -  If you were looking straight at it
        - Microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - Okay, so you said they could use it for rocket fuel
        -  But what other thing didn't say right there that you just read
- intent: r210.3
  examples: |
        - STUDENT and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first
        - but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one
        - awesome so STUDENT how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information
        - Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope STUDENT
        - Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment STUDENT Chris does your answer mentioned equipment
        - We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all STUDENT
        - My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon
        - Absolutely
        -  So STUDENT if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence
        -  But let's look at our discussion question
        - You're right you did talk about the water
        - Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?
        - Need you to narrow down your answer more specific
        - Okay, STUDENT, which what, what, where did you circle or words
        - Did what important word or words did you circle in the question
        - And they do use that, but I'm just like with STUDENT
        -  I asked him, did they use that to discover the water
        -  How else could they have found or what other STUDENTices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters
        -  When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us
        - So STUDENT
        -  Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future
        - STUDENT
        - But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon
        - Yeah, which that really isn't telling us
        - What the machine was right
        - STUDENT Did you find anything was talking about oxygen
        - Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?
        - And I think STUDENT That you had told us about oxygen tanks
        -  Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else
        - Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon
        - STUDENT Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question
        - So do you think STUDENT, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?
        - Do you think--
        -  And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?
        -  And she said, NASA send a small machine
        - Right, so that's why I was looking at STUDENT's answer
        - Well, yeah
        -  What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?
        -  Couldn't it?
        - Bus a small machine that could be anything
        - So what else could you put in your answer?
        - Do you know what the small machine was called?
        -  It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade STUDENT
        - As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that
        -  So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but
        -  Okay
        - Yes
        - Improvement and tell me what changes
        -  Did you make
        -  Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine
        - Um, depending on size
        -  How do you feel about your answer
        -  I think a STUDENT
        -  What might you say instead
        - Just to kind of circle back a little bit
        -  Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there
        -  If you were giving it another shot at it
        - Perfect
        -  Now, what was the microscope attached to?
        - You didn't
        -  You didn't actually name the machine, right
        -  Does that answer the question
        - So if you look into your statement
        - So that's going to be very valuable
        -  So what else can be valuable there
        -  It talks about in there
        - How are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it
        -  What else, what other purposes
        - That's right
        -  Does this takes point two for that answer
        - Right, so it can be used for what else
        - Right
        -  And they have, what do you know, there's one more
        -  I think
        - Very much and STUDENT
        -  There's one more
        - But did the microscope actually find the water?
        - So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable
        -  Did you hear that somewhere else
        - Okay art
        -  So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen
        - Is there any other words that are important
        -  STUDENT
        -  Yes
        - Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right
        -  What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So let's look at our question again and see if that answers
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So it's good
        -  But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable
        - It says it's good
        -  I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information
        - Um, so do you
        -  What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        -  Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think
        - Okay
        - Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use
        -  We want to learn more
        -  Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon
        - But we're we're expanding our thinking
        -  What could we do to improve that response
        - Improve that in response
        - Can anybody else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water
        -  Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?
        - But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope
        - Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?
        - But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?
        - But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?
        - Or is there a better answer?
        - There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?
        - Does anyone know
        - However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?
        - Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?
        - Right
        -  But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?
        -  They use a lot of equipment
        -  While that's true, is that what they used?
        - And just like STUDENT, he had mentioned some as well
        -  Okay
        - Sorry
        -  So does that say that that's what NASA sent though STUDENT?
        -  Guys, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - But does that say, that's what they sent
        - So they used, how can we
        - How could we restate this question
        - How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a
        - Question
        - What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about
        -  How could we restate that question
        - Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or
        - Let's see, let me think about that
        -  Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while
        -  How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while
        - Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about
        -  Okay
        - Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  Now try to think about that next time
        - Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space
        -  Does that tell us
        - But it just says that they found evidence that there was water
        -  Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there
        -  Does that mean that there's a lot?
        -  Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?
        - But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon
        - So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water
        -  They use it to examine the water
        - Yet, that's right
        -  So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it
        - Okay, water could be one
        -  Do you see any other words that could be important
        -  But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource
        - So it's already telling us it's valuable now STUDENT and Oliver
        -  I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not
        - So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything
        - No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon
        - Moving forward, this could be very valuable
        -  So what does the oxygen tank do STUDENT
        - Right
        - And one way
        - astronauts could do what with the water
        - But if there was water on the moon, but that help us
        -  But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon
        - And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall
        -  Do you need water to live on Earth
        - But let's say for example the do you need
        - But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me
        -  They might actually help out astronauts?
        - This can anybody does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon
        -   Is there enough evidence
        - But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future
        -  You know, you know, at least going forward
        -  If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there
        -  Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific
        - Okay, so when we answer something
        -  That way there's no confusion
        - So you, how do you think if we took your answer
        -  They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about
        - Okay
        -  So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?
        - That we need to expand upon some of the answers
        - And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope
        -  What did it show us
        - So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water
        -  And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you
        -  I'm gonna say STUDENT
        - Yeah
        -  It's, you just need to support it
        - No, it's not
        -  So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon STUDENT?
        -  So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment
        -  Let's look at back at some of our answers
        - Yes, absolutely
        -  So I see that we have
        - Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage
        - So, STUDENT that you said that NASA sent a small machine
        -  So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment
        -  Did you find
        - In why microscope wasn't the best choice
        - because the microscope was a tool
        -  In fact, so
        - So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool
        -  But how did they discover it or another word
        -  How did they find that water
        -  So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - Right? So the microscope does help us see the water
        -  But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place
        - So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right
        - My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split
        -  What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you
        - But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon
        -  Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today
        - STUDENT
        - Oh, STUDENT, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down
        -  It says that the whole time throughout the article
        - Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water
        - So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - That's true
        -  That is very true
        -  Did people go up on the moon, though
        - Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read
        -  Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article
        -  Is there a title of that machine
        -  Is there a name of that machine in number two?
        - That is true
        - Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response
        -  The rest of the article?
        -  Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope
        - Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon
        -  Do you remember?
        - They used a microscope
        -  But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space
        - STUDENT What
        - Do you underline
        - OK
        -  So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you
        -  I would like for one person in each group to share their answers with the group so STUDENT and Deb, you want to view, give me what words you guys underlying the question
        - STUDENT, you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct
        -  So, do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer
        - Yeah, okay
        - STUDENT What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer
        -  Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question
        - Okay
        -  I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct
        -  Can one of you tell me what words you guys underline
        - That may not in depth
        -  How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - STUDENT
        - STUDENT
        -  How could you be more specific in your answer
        - Teacherr: So how could you look back
        - To find that answer
        - STUDENT
        -  Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer
        - So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything
        -  So if the water is microscopic STUDENT, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment
        - Yeah, so I guess STUDENT also soften your answer
        - So STUDENT after, after reading, paragraph three, do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes?
        - Does anyone want to share what they circled
        -  Did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling The key word in the question?
        - Okay, STUDENT
        - STUDENT, did you Farrah and Oliver
        -  Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes
        - Do you think that your answer answers the question, STUDENT
        - So STUDENT, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope
        - Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it
        - But is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water?
        -  I don't think it quite is
        - But is that all that they used in order to find the water
        - Yeah, maybe not
        -  So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon
        - Is that completely accurate
        -  How do you guys think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed
        - I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your group members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions
        - Remember, he uses a microscope
        -  Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope
        - Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits
        - Right, so the microscope
        -  However, scientists were not on the moon
        -  If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope
        -  So your initial answer kind of got started on that process
        - Absolutely
        -  You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen
        -  That's a great answer
        -  But why can't take a spring water with them
        -  Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them
        -  What do you say,
        - You did kind of explain that you said that they need water
        - But it's even more valuable because they
        - And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes STUDENT
        -  When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water
        - But the water
        - What can the astronaut use
        - Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have
        -  What are we trying to make by STUDENT tanks and Luis's two elements
        - Right
        -  Oh
        - So is it going to have a moon garden
        - So, hmm, is this patient, very large
        - Maybe, but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there
        -  So do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon
        - I would tell you
        - Yeah, I like that
        -  Do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said?
        -  STUDENT, do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there
        - But is that the only thing that they sent, the only thing that they used
        - They will if, as if an astronaut went to the moon, they definitely would have to, but when we look at this, this text, do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon, or was it machines
        - I just would like the answer what the machine is called
        - Do you think that they would use both parts one part, what do you think?
        - that's definitely an aspect of it
        -  um So do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts
        - Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?
        - Teacher:, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope
        - is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes
        - awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable
        - So even though it's not ready yet STUDENT, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future
        -  It's just the oxygen tank
        - Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great
        -  Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?
        -  I'm glad that you could acknowledge that
        - It would help you to get to the moon right?
        - there's the possibility there's what STUDENT said what he said, is there any others, that you have found
        - so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water
        - right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right
        - Were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water
        - i'm so STUDENT, you said, water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship, other than its weight
        - On what your answers could be changed, how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what I was expecting from you guys who'd like to go first
        - Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had
        - So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes STUDENT
        - Okay awesome alright STUDENT so your answer was just circling the same as Farrah is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer
        - But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer
        - Now, STUDENT, did you see where it said the equipment
        - And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what STUDENT said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?
        - Has everyone had a chance to reread the question in the passage?
        - Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked- you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable
        - So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me
        - Does anyone want to share what words they circled?
        -  STUDENT, what did you circle?
        - Okay
        - Okay anyone else? any other words?
        -  What did you circle?
        - You only circled water
        -  What about you STUDENT you're one who hasn't shared yet
        - So what is the answer to our question?
        - yeah What was it called
        - So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail
        - So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope
        - They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy
        - that's true, but how does that relate to water
        - Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable
        - So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there
        -  Have you found anything
        - STUDENT
        -  But let's think about what else they used
        - And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used
        -  So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it
        - The reading
        -  STUDENT
        -  I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it
        - Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank
        - A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember
        - that's perfect, do you know any other tools
        - Perfect anything else
        - can you add another tool to that
        - The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?
        -  Have you thought of an answer
        - STUDENT Do you have anything
        -  Yeah
        - STUDENT
        -  After giving yourself a little bit more time
        -  Did you figure out any answers
        -  so in some of your answers, STUDENT and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all?
        - Great job STUDENT
        - It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing
        - Ok, so if you had to redo your answer STUDENT What would you say now?
        - mm hmm and then what would you add to it?
        - Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?
        - but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is
        - So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response
        - can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?
        - yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?
        - So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon
        - All right, you guys did an awesome job STUDENT after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers
        -  Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage
        -  So when
        - That's a great question
        -  So who thinks
        - Do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common
        - SO I'M STUDENT in your response
        -  You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does
        - STUDENT, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response
        -  Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit
        - So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer
        - So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks
        - Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at
        - Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine
        - now they have room for what STUDENT?
        - Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing STUDENT
        - But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water
        - So Deb
        -  What is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like, what can you expand on your answer
        -  A little bit
        - Um, can I ask, how about STUDENT, do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit
        - So I do agree with you, but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker, do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon, instead of bringing it on their ship or now well, I mean if they could do it faster and quicker than
        - yeah, but do you agree that if it was ready, that it would be awesome to have it on the moon
        - So STUDENT would you want to maybe like how about Farrah and Oliver could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer
        - With the information that we just talked about all together
        - Right, so let's go back to your response real fast
        -  You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?
        - That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon
        - On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay
        - yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water
        - Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than STUDENT's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story
        - so was there a word that you guys picked in your group that you got that you thought was important to a question
        - So what words are what equipment has mentioned
        - That is also used to find water on the moon
        - Would anyone like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled
        - The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?
        - STUDENT, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer
        - Where do we use a lunar orbiter?
        - On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?
        - How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?
        - but also because the water is so small on the moon right?
        - So how can we add those into our answer?
        - STUDENT, how can you change your answer?
        - All right, let's go to STUDENT Jazmin, how can you change your answer?
        - yeah all right STUDENT, how can you include those into your answer?
        -  So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?
        - So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon
        - awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit STUDENT to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?
        - STUDENT, how can you change your answer?
        - Well, your answer is not completely wrong
        -  You did say that NASA send a small machine, but can you tell me what that small machine is
        -  So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, STUDENT?
        - A lunar orbiter
        -  But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?
- intent: r120.4
  examples: |
        - So let's see STUDENT what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share Their answer and what they were thinking
        - yeah so STUDENT What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me
        - hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from STUDENT all the way down to Luis from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question
        - STUDENT repeat for me what your answer was, real quick
        - Great Thank you
        - and you STUDENT?
        - Wonderful. 
        - STUDENT?
        - Nice and STUDENT
        - Great
        - and STUDENT
        - Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle
        -  Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is
        - Okay
        - Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?
        - Okay, so what's your answer?
        - STUDENT, what do you think?
        - STUDENT did you find the answer
        - nd first I'd like to address STUDENT Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us
        - Okay, STUDENT, would you like to read your answer
        -  Okay, and STUDENT, would you like to read us your answer
        - Yes
        - and STUDENT that would you like to read as your answer
        - Okay STUDENT What do you think
        -  STUDENT
        - So let's talk about some of your answers
        -  Would one of you like to volunteer your answer
        -  STUDENT
        - Can we start with your answer
        -  Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer
        -  STUDENT
        - Great
        - I wanted to just STUDENT
        -  If you remind me of your answer
        -  STUDENT was that you
        - Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea
        - What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer
        - STUDENT, maybe
        -  Did you guys circle, a word
        - All right
        - Who would like to tell me what word they circled
        -  Did you circle in your question
        -  What word
        - STUDENT, let's start with you
        -  How about you, STUDENT
        - Good
        - Can someone tell me what two words that they circled
        - Good
        -  So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage
        - STUDENT, what did you underline or circle
        - Okay, STUDENT, you know, what did you underline or circle
        -  All right
        -  Then what did you underline or circle
        - Okay
        -  Would you remind me of what you had told me before
        - STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading
        -  So I'd like to start with STUDENT
        -  Maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading
        - So, um, I want to know from you all
        -  What about you, was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  What about you, is there something really interesting about the reading
        -  And, um, STUDENT
        - Okay
        - Hi, STUDENT
        -  Thank you for raising your hand, would you like to share something interesting about the reading
        -  STUDENT You said you knew a lot about science
        - All right
        -  Was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you
        - Okay I saw savannas hand first
        -  What do you think, STUDENT
        - STUDENT, do you have something you'd like to add
        - I'm sorry, STUDENT, what was that?
        - Do you remember put for that?
        - What did you put?
        - All right, do you have anything else you want to add?
        - I'm sorry
        -  Say that one more time
        - Um, what, what did you correct it to what did you write down again
        - And let's just see what you guys got STUDENT
        -  Did you find one
        - All right
        -  Did you get the chance to revise yours?
        -  Um, and then STUDENT
        - STUDENT
        -  Would you remind me of your answer again
        - I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
        -  Can you repeat that?
        - So who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment
        -  Was it informative for you?
        -  What do you think about the reading
        - STUDENT
        - What do you think about the article STUDENT?
        - Was it interesting for you?
        -  STUDENT
        - Will you like to do that
        - STUDENT, what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today?
        -  Thanks for raising your hands there
        - STUDENT

        -  So can you tell me what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon?
        - STUDENT, you said that you circled the same as Farrah
        -  What did you find?

        - Okay, do you want to share with us what you thought is water a valuable resource?
        - yeah so that's one reason does anybody have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource?
        - Never know! STUDENT, what do you think okay so um
        - What did you say water is a valuable resource or not

- intent: r220.1
  examples: |
        - Hello um I think these are all really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so Can I get a yes
        - I think we all have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text
        - Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to OK, so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us To understand a little bit what we're reading, but we specifically also want to look for evidence right
        - The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this group is I want you to think what is this question asking
        - what what does it mean to circle evidence
        -  yeah STUDENT
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        -  So what is an ice deposit
        - And we had some really great responses
        -  So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text
        - But in a text
        -  It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - Well, we're gonna learn some more
        -  I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about
        - Thank you for joining me at the small group table, guys
        - Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon
        -  I want
        -  OK
        - And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have
        -  I just want you guys to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        - But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question
        - Hey everybody, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer
        -  STUDENT What's going on
        -  Can you read the discussion question for us
        - I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me
        -  Again, STUDENT
        - Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer
        -  Okay
        - But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer
        -  Oh yes, STUDENT
        - And I wanted to kind of dive into these here
        -  I want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent
        -  And I'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about it
        - So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article
        -  Now we got to read about something really cool
        - To get more specific with our response
        -  Not just one person answering okay
        - Okay
        -  Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort
        - We are just diving deeper into the text as a team, so that everyone is on the same page
        - Yeah
        -  Who knows, have a strategy that we can use
        -  So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question
        -  That's what we're going to do
        -  So let's take a look at your answers
        - And so in this case
        - Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space
        -  And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that
        -  So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more
        - Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion
        -  So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were
        - And the, the question
        - Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough
        -  Okay? Do you know what thorough is?
        - We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions
        -  So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses
        - Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our
        - Writing that is going to help us connect and learn
        - Better
        -  I want
        -  We want to see the process of how are we going to
        -  Okay
        -  Can we do that
        - Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response
        -  So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about
        - Good thing
        -  All right, great
        -  Okay, so what was our question
        - Okay
        -  Can someone read that for me
        -  So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text
        -  So here's what we're gonna do, guys
        -  We're going to go through each of your responses
        -  Okay, so let's look at your response
        - Okay, so let's look back at STUDENT answer real quick
        -  First, what did you say
        -  Does that sound good to you guys
        - So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you guys about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage
        -  Yes
        -  STUDENT
        - we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon
        -  So remember the discussion question is-- yes STUDENT?
        - All right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer
        - Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know all about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about
        -  I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it
        -  So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff
        -  I didn't even know about water on the moon
        -  So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this group
        - So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers
        -  But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions
        -  So I want you all to look at question number two
        - Yeah, wonderful, buddy
        - Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on
        -  So I suppose I will start with
        -  So that's the main goal of what we're working on together
        - extracting information from from informative text
        - Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the group can learn from
        - So work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those
        -  Okay?
        - A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small group is to kind of build off those responses
        -  So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon
        - Well good
        -  And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  If you just raise your hand
        -  I'll call on you
        -  So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you
        -  And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work
        - So what we can do is just kind of go around the room
        - But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting
        -  Okay
        -  So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good
        -  But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question
        - Well, I hope you're right
        -  Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a group to kind of share our knowledge with each other
        -  Okay
        - Because we're not just
        -  So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer
        - I saw bits and pieces of that in there
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        -  Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers
        - It's good to see you too
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        - So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer
        - Great
        -  You're talking about space
        -  Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon
        - So the reason why we're looking back over your answers
        - but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that y'all
        -  Write down for your answers
        - You guys put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is
        -  Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        -  And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence
        - Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer
        -  I do like that you what you changed your answer to
        -  Okay
        -  And we're going to hang out
        -  We're going to help other people in this group use that same thought process
        -  And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer
        - Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer
        -  We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give
        - Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords
        - Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this group
        - So today I want us to work on finding
        - keywords in questions to help us better answer questions
        - So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer
        - We're all going to be in the group to learn together and discuss what we read
        - We're just having a group discussion now that we've read
        - Okay well we're all put in this group to help each other learn, um,
        - And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out
        -  Sound like a plan?
        -  So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together
        -  But we're not all quite there just yet
        - Fantastic
        -  I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell all of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time
        - One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes
        - That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class
        -  And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your group discussion
        - Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one group
        - And I want to make sure that everybody has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water
        - Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon
        -  You might find something that you didn't know
        - Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today
        - The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you guys
        - No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you guys got your answers from
        - Well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it
        - For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text
        -  Does that sound good
        -  STUDENT
        - So for this group, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading
        - tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you guys to use examples exactly from the text that way
        -  I know that you guys had an easy time reading
        - Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do
        -  It sounds good to you, STUDENT?
        - good to hear so today I put you on a group because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon
        - and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon
        - There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you guys will be time to write down your answers to questions
        - Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small group, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer
        -  Yes STUDENT
        - So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes STUDENT
        -  So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you
        -  So, STUDENT to start
        - So I think you guys all did a really great job thinking while using our text
        - I know that you know all about space
        -  It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts
        -  But this isn't about learning about space
        -  Does that makes sense?
        - So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text
        -  Yes STUDENT
        - So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them
        - You may know all about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages
        - So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you guys can better understand
        -  Awesome
        - How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage
        -  So I want one-- yes, STUDENT
        -  So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did everyone read? Yes, OK
        -  So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding
        -  So we're going to try to fix that today
        - Hi, everyone
        - hi everyone so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So first before we share our answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question
        - Everyone had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects
        - Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better
        -  Maybe you guys do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text
        - So I think so
        - In from the reading
        - However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material
        -  So this really helpful
        -  I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills
        - That can be true, however, today we're using science
        - to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about
        - As you guys have done we're going to be using that reading
        - and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions
        - And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills
        -  So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science
        - But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills
        - And how we work to break down questions and such um
        - I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language
        -  Like I said to STUDENT earlier, we're not just working on our science skills, we're also working on our reading and writing skills
        - that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills
        - Um yeah, but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like STUDENT knows a lot about
        - we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down
        - information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff
        - So we just want to make sure that everybody is using the right language and everybody understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um STUDENT you had your hand up well, I was
        - So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question
        - But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question
        - Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies
        - Well, right now we're working on STUDENTeloping our responses
        -  So even if you know a lot
        -  It's about verbalizing what you know
        -  So that's what we're practicing right now
        - Well, hello
        -  What's up, STUDENT
        -  Okay, so I just heard all of your awesome responses
        -  So I'm going to start
        -  Yes
        -  And I just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text
        -  Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon
        - Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space
        - So STUDENT I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you guys to know is that
        - You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made all together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there
        - The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it
        - Because you're in this group doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done
        - So we're going to be focusing on just this text, so that we can digest this and answer the question
        -  So even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information, but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read
        - So i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over, and so what I want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes STUDENT
        - So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you guys an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for
        - Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does everybody remember
        - Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer
        - So let's talk a little bit more about what we can - go ahead, STUDENT
        - Well, STUDENT
        -  That's great
        -  That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more
        - Very good
        -  So we are going to talk about The tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we're all here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question,
        -  And the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts
        -  I know that you know about space
        -  So STUDENT, we're working on reading informational texts
        - That would be really cool
        - And look for those answers in the text
        -  Okay STUDENT Do question
        - Hey, so today we're going to do something super cool
        -  Okay, so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text
        -  We are going to be reading detectives
        -  I have learned that about you and it's something I value about you, but I want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks
        - You know what you think
        -  This year, you're going to need that skills
        - Because when we read informational texts
        -  Okay
        - We asked that to answer and test a dependent question
        -  If you still have some progress
        -  Okay
        - Hello, boys and girls
        -  And what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy, then you are going to practice it in a small group and I will come back to talk a little more individually
        - We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that everyone knows that you have a full understanding of the topic
        -  I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us
        - I know I remember that
        -  And based on your answer
        -  We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given
        - However, we're working on a few different things in this group
        -  Because what's cool about partial answers
        - Well, STUDENT This group is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other
        -  And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers
        - Is that everyone has different partial answers
        - Okay, so let's all read read through it
        -  I think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers
        - I also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there
        - but we're going to go over this question together because I think that all of us
        - Had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question
        -  And I want to lead us to the right answer today
        -  So I'm just here to clarify the answer for us
        -  Either we all didn't write it for our answer
        -  And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer
        - But you didn't write that for your answer
        - Okay, I got us into this group because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers
        - So I've seend all responses, and I would like for you guys to use evidence from the text to support your answer
        - Does anyone know what I mean by using evidence from the text
        - hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you all today i'm excited to work with you on trying to STUDENTelop really complete answers
        - I just pulled you all together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said
        - Yeah, so that's why I wanted to pull you into this group so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question, fully
        - so then we can go forward and make sure that we're all on the same page about what, what did they use
        -  I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather all this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer
        - So, thank you
        -  I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for
        - Yeah, yeah, some great stuff
        -  How do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need
        -  So we're, we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading
        -  So sometimes when I'm reading, there's so much information
        - Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text
        -  We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information
        - what we're doing today, why have you guys in a group is because we're trying to go even further we're going to
        - Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you guys
        - are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you
        - What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates
        - I want all of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text
        - Or we can strengthen your responses
        - But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you
        - wasting your own time, because we really want to think about moving forward in the future, how to answer questions to the best of our ability
        - Yes, that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and everybody else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three, just so we can all look and think critically about this piece of evidence, to see if it matches our question um
        - I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more
        - Get more detail in there
        - So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer STUDENT
        - Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text
        - Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further
        - But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today STUDENT
        - And will also give personalized feedback during this process, and finally, we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response
        - I am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response
        - Well, thanks for sharing your responses to the second question guys I think again, we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses, using the text
        - And the timing starts now
        - And who knows, maybe we could also teach you something as well right? Because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you guys, right?
        - so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space
        -  But what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right?
        - so we're all here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us, okay? so we're going to practice, these skills
        - Great so I want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're all going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses
        - each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts, and so, for pretty much everyone in this group i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers
- intent: r230.2
  examples: |
        - Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes STUDENT
        - So STUDENT can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say
        - yeah so STUDENT can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that
        - Yes, you do
        -  But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her
        - Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different
        - Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made
        -  STUDENT based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing
        - And what makes you think that way
        - STUDENT Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says
        -  Where did you find evidence that
        - The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  Can you tell me where what you found
        - Great
        - STUDENT
        -  Does that tell us that that happened
        -  What paragraph
        -  You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Uh huh
        -  Let's talk about your answer
        - Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks
        -  Yes, yes
        - That's right, good job
        -  Can you tell me what paragraph you found
        -  STUDENT
        -  It is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Did you find that answer in the in the text?
        - So STUDENT
        - STUDENT, you told me that you circled the same answer as Farrah but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because
        - Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what STUDENT had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing
        -  Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?
        - STUDENT, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question
        - If you will refer back to your article back to your reading
        -  Yes
        -  I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water STUDENT, I see your hand up
        - So, STUDENT, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water
        -  Okay, STUDENT does Jazmin answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three
        - Wonderful
        - Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?
        - So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find
        -  Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in
        - Perfect and STUDENT
        -  So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though
        - So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely
        - All right
        -  Well, let's think about it this way, STUDENT, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?
        - Where did you read that in the text
        -  So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used STUDENT, let's start with you
        - I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech
        -  What evidence did you use
        - STUDENT
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle to help you answer
        -  Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you
        -  STUDENT What evidence
        - And I want to hear from STUDENT really quickly
        -  What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope
        - Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope
        - And STUDENT, what happened
        -  How did they study that the small ice deposits
        - Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is
        - Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?
        - Right
        -  Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope
        - So what do you guys think about that
        -  Where is the evidence that might help you with this question
        - Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called
        - Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?
        - And we also read in the paragraphs
        -  What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools
        - And what else did you, did you read
        - So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?
        - Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water
        -  Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?
        - So, I see deposits are very small
        - So it's using the equipment to do what?
        - All right
        -  So did they use the microscope to discover the water?
        - That's right
        -  Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that
        - Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence
        -  And what are we using to investigate our evidence?
        - So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five
        - Can we look back for some details? STUDENT
        - Right
        -  So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?
        -  But does it mention that in the paragraphs?
        - Right
        - So you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1
        - What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence
        - Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy
        -  So read that sentence again for me
        - So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at
        - What is this, what was the small machine called
        - Good
        -  So what did this machine, do
        -  And so you said they sent this machine
        - Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?
        -  How much water did they find
        - Um you so talk to me about that
        - So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?
        - But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags
        - What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?
        -  But what does it tell us in the story?
        - Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks
        - How did
        -  Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water
        - Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?
        -  So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically
        - Right
        - do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming
        - Okay, so let's
        -  Did you circle in the text
        -  Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence
        - You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence
        -  Did you circle
        - Okay, well what paragraph
        -  Do you think we can find that in
        -  How did you find that answer
        - And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer
        - But what are we looking closely for?
        - Alright, so let's go look
        -  Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there
        -  What did it send the small machine to do?
        -  Okay
        -  So you talked about NASA sending a small machine
        -  If we look back at the text
        - Good
        -  What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used
        - Teacher:But what equipment do you think they used to find it
        - And, but let's
        -  Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?
        - And what does that lunar orbiter do?
        - To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?
        -  And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things
        - Mm hmm
        - Okay
        -  and STUDENT, is that where you found your evidence as well?
        -  And so that's very good, STUDENT
        -  And where did you see that at?
        - Okay, they sent a small machine
        -  What did it do?
        - That's one type of equipment
        -  What else did they do with the equipment
        - Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article
        - Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine
        -  Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included
        - I want you guys to take a second to locate
        - In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you guys to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope
        - oxygen tanks
        -  Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well
        - So So Deb
        -  Let's look at microscope
        -  Did you find where we can find microscope and and there
        -  Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?
        - Yeah, and STUDENT
        -  Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?
        - No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence
        - What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen
        -  How are they going to use the hydrogen?
        - Where did you get your answer from, STUDENT
        - Where did you find your answer?
        - So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage
        -  What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage
        - STUDENT, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?
        - STUDENT You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks
        -  What are they using that for
        - Very good
        -  Did you look back in the text using your keywords
        -  I'm so how did you find that answer
        -  So I want everyone to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer
        - Gotcha
        - Okay STUDENT
        -  Where did you find in the text to support your answer
        - And STUDENT, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer
        -  Why did you underline that in paragraph two
        -  And so, STUDENT
        - Okay
        -  STUDENT why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,
        - Okay
        - STUDENT Where did you come up with your answer
        - and STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        -  Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story
        -  In fact, everybody look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person
        -  Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion
        -  What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope
        - Now, do me a favor
        -  Have you found it
        - STUDENT
        - To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage
        -  Help me understand what led you to your conclusion
        -  Do me a favor, go back into the text
        - So STUDENT
        -  Did you find the information about the crater
        - Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph
        - So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking
        -  Help me, help me with yours
        -  I asked you to find where you found your information in the text
        -  Where'd you see it
        - STUDENT
        - And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine
        - Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text
        - Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?
        -  They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for
        - Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss STUDENT, and you said that they sent a small machine
        -  Yeah
        - Okay
        -  Okay
        -  Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?
        - Could you share with the class The section that mentioned this tool
        - Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?
        - Okay um so what in the text makes you think that
        - Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?
        - Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to
        - Using a microscope as a piece of equipment
        - Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine
        - No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Is there a place in the text where you found that STUDENT
        -  And you talked about that NASA send something
        - So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question STUDENT
        - The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,
        - so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text
        - Thank you alright STUDENT so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text
        - All right, awesome Thank you alright STUDENT, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat
        - All right, thank you so STUDENT where did you find your answer in the text
        - let's see where where did you find that in the text
        - yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us
        - Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay
        - and just a second the STUDENT can you find where the microscope is in text
        - awesome alright so STUDENT where did you find the information about microscope and the text
        - Really? I didn't know - is that, did you get that from the passage?
        - STUDENT you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        -  So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?
        - OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter
        - Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you
        - So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that
        - Did you read that in the article
        - Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that
        -  So could you like just show
        - Could you share with us where you found where you read um or just I can read your answer: scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So def
        -  You said you had the same answer as STUDENT
        -  Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading
        - um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?
        - Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use
        -  How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?
        -  And can we all think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that
        -  You can go now
        - So can we go back right now, and we can all look at our responses, think about what we said
        - STUDENT, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?
        - And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?
        - Now, when STUDENT found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?
        - Good all right i'm going to call on STUDENT first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information
        - So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from
        - Can you show me where you found that
        -  OK, and let's go to STUDENT
        -  Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?
        -  I like that, that is very true
        -  STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Good
        -  So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?
        - Yes
        - Can you read me the sentence of one of them
        -  Can you read me that sentence? Where you can find that?
        -  Great
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        -  And do you remember where we found that?
        - Perfect
        -  Is there a Quote, that you remember
        - Yeah
        -  I was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text
        -  So you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes
        -  You said NASA send a small machine
        -  Do you read about that
        -  Do you have text evidence from your response
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Now where in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle, the same thing
        -  Can you point that out, just so that everyone's on the same page
        -  Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?
        - i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be STUDENT Jazmin Luis
        - But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource
        - Okay, and STUDENT you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text
        -  Where did you find your evidence
        - um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up
        - STUDENT, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?
        -  So where do you think you found that one
        -  And do you know when we answer these I want you guys to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text
        - Yeah they do use that that is a really good point
        -  So like the microscope part, where was that?
        - You can say The number of the point it was on
        - Is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text
        - So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from?
        - Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text
        - So good so in the text where did you find that in the text, what made you choose as your response
        - Alright, so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question
        - All right, that is very true I want you to walk me through where you found that answer
        - In paragraph five, did you find it
        -  So that you know where you saw that in the text?
        - But we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text
        - You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank
        -  Why don't you look back now
        - So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know
        - And if you don't see it, that's okay too
        -  And I see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five, is that correct
        - Awesome
        - I do have a question for you
        -  Is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article
        -  Do you remember, or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on Earth
        - Right, what's, what's the textual evidence to support STUDENT's claim with the main idea of the first Paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon
        - And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore
        - Very good
        -  Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is
        - Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable
        -  Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts
        -  If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel
        - Does I'm pretty cool
        -  I just, I just need the actual text, please
        - Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you
        - Yes, good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so How does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use
        - But I just need you to write down where you found your answer
        -  Okay
        - But then I want you to tell me where you find the evidence
        -  Okay
        - Why, why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text
        - What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water STUDENT
        - I'm wondering how is your answer, different from STUDENT and what evidence did you use To explain how your you got a different answer from Jazmin and what evidence you used
        -  Did you find evidence of that in the text
        -  To look really closely
        -  Okay
        - Teacher : So a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Teacher : STUDENT You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  Where did you see oxygen tanks
        -  That's what came first, in the text right?
        - Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense
        -  I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not STUDENT Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah
        - STUDENT's nswer
        -  Where did you find your answer
        - Hmm
        -  And where did you find that
        - That's fantastic
        -  Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs
        -  We are in the texts
        -  The more specific
        -  Exactly
        -  Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc
        - Wow, that's awesome Background information
        - Let me pull up my text, which paragraph was that in
        - Cool
        -  And did you get that information from the reading that we did
        - And when you're reading through what makes you, where do you think that came from in the reading?
        -  Where do you think STUDENT got the answer of the oxygen tanks
        - So as you're reading
        - Oh, where did you find that in the text
        - You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?
        -  You found that in paragaph two as well right?
        - Oh, I see
        -  Let's look a little closer at STUDENT's answer
        -  So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where STUDENT got his answer and what you might Luis yeah
        - Since we've looked at STUDENT's answer and Luis's answer
        - In the text
        -  Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water
        - What did you read
        -  If you notice the word so you can explain
        - And where did you get that idea from within the text
        - Yes exactly where you found it
        - Was that a big clue for you
        - Well what paragraph, did you get that from?
        - I like the way you're thinking, can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used
        - And STUDENT, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that
        - But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        -  Yes, a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text
        -  What are some things that are listed in the text
        -  Did you see that in the text
        - Yes
        - Did you finding the passage
        - yeah which line it's
        - So, can you tell me like where you found this answer, STUDENT?
        - Oh, a lot, where do you find this information
        - Oh, where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph
        -  Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?
        - Yeah, that's right
        -  So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water
        - Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono
        -  So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word
        -  What do you think that
        - You're right
        - Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text
        - So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks
        - I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking
        - So I'm also going to follow the same question for you
        - So I'm glad you said that
        -  So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and STUDENT, what exactly what language or what part of that
        -  Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me
        - um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?
        - Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks
        - and where in the passage STUDENT, can we find one of those
        - Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists
        - yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3
        - hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on STUDENT could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer
        - Yes, and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text, which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph?
        - and where they found the evidence in the tax alright
        - Could you tell me where you found that in the text
        - STUDENT could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand
        - No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope
        - Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used
        - Well that's wonderful
        - STUDENT What in the text drove you to your answer
        - Right so STUDENT where in the text did you find the microscope?
        - STUDENT have you found were in the story you want us to focus on
        - Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that STUDENT because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text
        - That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that STUDENT
        -  STUDENT yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text
        -  Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either STUDENT or Farrah read that sentence for us?
        -  I saw you guys had some consensus
        - Seeing nods
        -  So why don't we start with STUDENT and Farrah
        -  Thank you, thank you
        - Can you tell us where in the text STUDENT you found this information?
        - Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text
        -  Our items, did anyone see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found
        -  I'm seeing a shake head from STUDENT
        -  And what made you think that from the passage?
        - Mm-hmm
        - it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?
        - Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence
        -  STUDENT where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?
        - Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us
        - awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence
        - hard to find an answer from
        - Shall we just go back and see together since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that so STUDENT, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from
        - How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph
        - but what did the text makes you think that was the answer
        - Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?
        - Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that
        - so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?
        - did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable
        - yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with STUDENT so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different
        - Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine
        - mm hmm that's true and where's STUDENT Do you remember, where the microscope part was
        - so STUDENT, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater
        - Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment
        - Okay, and do you have a specific sentence
        - Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence
        - Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident
        - What paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere STUDENT
        - Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and
        - Can you read that sentence, do you have it circle in your APP
        - Oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text
        - yeah and then STUDENT quick quick update with you what part of the reading, did you find that in
        - So STUDENT was that answer directly from the text first
        - yeah So could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out? So where did you find that information in this text?
        - so STUDENT, could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope
        - can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine
        - and did you circle that sentence in the text
        - STUDENT what you circle, you said you circle, the same thing as Farrah, can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled
        - Absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic So what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy
        - Would you mind, did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge
        - So you found that from the text right
        - And where did you read that
        - um, I also would like to know what you guys circled in the text
- intent: r230.3
  examples: |
        - So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome 
        - yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different
        - So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it
        - So STUDENT and Oliver, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together
        - and STUDENT i'll be with you in just a second
        - Oh okay STUDENT You said something like that didn't you
        - and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this
        - so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right
        - But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you guys sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers
        -  STUDENT yeah
        -  They can use what's on the man
        - Right, okay
        -  That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there
        - Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water
        -  Right
        -  And also, STUDENT was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it
        - Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel
        - From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there
        -  Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, back to STUDENT
        -  So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well
        - You're welcome and and STUDENT, you said that you had circled the same thing as Farrah
        -  Right
        - It, STUDENT, and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment
        -  You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space
        - Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment
        - So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks
        -  I appreciate that
        -  I do agree with you
        -  We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but
        - That we haven't seen it yet
        - And so, carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,
        - Am I correct STUDENT is that you're thinking
        - Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon
        -  We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead
        -  And that would make it valuable to us
        -  STUDENT
        - Hey everybody
        -  You said that you use the microscope to look closely
        -  I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  He said he thought it was in paragraph three
        - Okay, so, STUDENT just gave us an excellent answer
        -  She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from STUDENT
        - That's okay
        -  Thank you for raising your hand so STUDENT thought it was in paragraph three, and Jazmin thought it was in paragraph two,
        -  Um, you said using a small machine, STUDENT
        - You did correct your answer, but your answer
        - Very good
        -  And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Correct?
        -  She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Perfect so answering that STUDENT answered it perfectly
        - Correct?
        - You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more
        - Yes, that would be an option to maybe STUDENT Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read
        -  So, STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        -  And that's true
        -  Let's take care of that
        -  Let's then switch track
        - All right
        -  Let's see here
        -  All right
        -  So let's take a look right now
        - You got it all figured out
        -  We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  STUDENT I'm excited to hear
        - Addition there
        -  So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there
        -  You talk about a to look really close
        -  Your answer isn't ready yet
        - It's not ready yet
        -  To us yet
        -  So you said the water is not ready to eat
        -  Is that what you're trying to say
        - So I just wanted to clarify that
        - Nothing
        -  I can't remember who said it but you have saving way
        -  I think it was STUDENT right
        - So are all these things we just talked about that have value
        - Right, are all of these things, able to be done with water
        - Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes
        -  So these are all the things that you should listen
        - So let's look at your evidence so STUDENT and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked
        -  All of these are good pieces of information from our passage
        - At the craters on the moon and STUDENT was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine
        -  So, STUDENT says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found Chris, what did you want to add
        - Awesome
        -  Did they use to discover
        -  Okay, what equipment
        - She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things
        - So STUDENT is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon
        -  So STUDENT also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage
        - Very good
        - Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship
        -  So that is very good thinking,
        - That is very true
        -  They could have room for other things
        -  Yes, water is heavy
        - Machine was sent to investigate
        - Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space
        -  So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space
        -  Does that make sense?
        - Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water
        -  And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet
        - I'm jab and STUDENT you both wrote no to this answer
        - STUDENT has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and
        - And then STUDENT's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink
        - Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,
        -  Yeah, they did
        - Okay
        -  They need a lot of tools
        -  They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen
        - Yes, and you are exactly right
        -  They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon
        -  You guys said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable
        - So I see that STUDENT and Farrah
        - Yes, and I completely agree
        -  And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but
        -  It will take a long time
        -  You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        -  You definitely can't
        - Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer
        -  That is very true
        -  So it is very valuable to have the water
        -  And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - Also see where STUDENT, he added, kind of onto your answer
        -  So we need oxygen
        - I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space
        - NASA sent a small machine
        - They said that they wanted a microscope
        - Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that STUDENT?
        -  So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely
        -  So let's go ahead and get into those answers
        - Okay, well that's perfect STUDENT
        -  So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important
        - Exactly right
        - Let's see, STUDENT and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true
        - Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else STUDENT?
        - ,
        -  Um, let's see
        -  So those are very important things
        -  You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        -  STUDENT You said water can be
        - See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture
        -  So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct
        - Awesome
        -  Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there
        -  Awesome
        - Good
        -  Good
        -  So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat
        -  Okay
        -  Right
        -  Okay, so
        -  Right, so that
        -  So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now
        -  Um, so, STUDENT, you said not for a long time
        - read what you wrote your class
        -  Is that right, is that what you meant by that
        -  Yeah
        - Why it's going to take a long time
        -  Correct
        -  So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now
        -  That is exactly right
        -  We do need water to survive
        -  And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said
        -  Right
        -  The astronauts
        - You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        -  You can't survive without water
        -  You said water is is heavy
        -  So it's good
        - Yeah, I was trying to get to that
        -  So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there
        -  They don't have to carry it and ships anymore
        -  Correct
        -  That's good
        -  Yes
        - Okay, so let's let's think about your answer
        -  So you said they use Microsoft's correct
        -  Is that right,
        - STUDENT, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm Farrah
        - But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer
        -  You said that you could
        - Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there
        -  When you said that
        -  Right
        -  So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph
        - And I, I want to ask another question
        - Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle
        - Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Alright so Miss STUDENT
        - Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs
        -  There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable
        - So you are right in the fact that it is heavy
        -  And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource
        -  It takes up a lot of room
        - Okay, well, we'll go over yours too
        -  So you mentioned a small machine
        - Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water
        - Okay
        -  I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well
        -  And I agree with you, STUDENT
        -  Yeah
        - So the two verbs here where
        - Discover and equipment
        -  Okay, so let's take about
        - STUDENT and Oliver, both of y'all kind of said no it's not ready
        - There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time
        -  So it's good
        - And I'll see yourSTUDENT and you put water is heavy
        -  They don't have to curate in the ships anymore
        -  So I guess with your answer
        -  They found water
        -  That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so
        - You're kind of saying that it's important
        - And so, STUDENT, you've mentioned that it will be a long time
        -  It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water
        -  In other words, it's not available right away
        - Yeah, and that's certainly very true
        - Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important
        -  Astronauts have to carry it in space
        - That's right and STUDENT mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry Chris
        -  And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now
        -  But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable
        - Very good
        -  So that's very useful
        -  So that's a very good observation on your part STUDENT
        -  And then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people
        -  That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food
        -  And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you
        - That's a great idea
        - Okay
        -  It has no value, right
        -  So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it
        - You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water
        - and so STUDENT You mentioned that you can see water puddles
        - That's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do
        - Oh, good job
        -  So it's something that
        -  What about you, Demi
        - Needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right
        - So there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have
        - Okay, so they're making statements to make you believe something
        -  And that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated
        - You're very good drink it
        -  Right
        - Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right
        - So back to STUDENT
        -  And I think, STUDENT, you said you had the same answers her
        - STUDENT, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon
        - you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward
        -  Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive
        -  Um, it would be very expensive
        - Okay, well, good job, for sure
        -  Just because we don't really have anybody there but
        - Yes, yes, it's so you are correct
        -  Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable
        - Yes, yes it
        -  Good job
        -  STUDENT you Luis are on the same page
        -  Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future
        - You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon
        - Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?
        -  We can't see it with our
        - Okay, so it's really, really, really, really, really, really small
        -  Okay
        -  So let's think about putting all of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us
        - Yeah
        -  We know that the
        -  So we're going to put all of this together
        - Right, that we found on the moon
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits
        - Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine
        - Perfect, perfect
        - You can do some cool stuff with it and STUDENT actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it
        -  The astronauts and so water is very heavy on
        - You're right
        - Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts
        -  Is that true
        -  It sounds like you think, yes
        - From your evidence
        - Yes you do say yes answers
        -  There's an exclamation point
        -  So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it
        - STUDENT
        -  So, um,
        -  So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe
        -  So you put no, not for a long time
        -  So you're saying no
        - Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Waters, so it's good
        -  They don't have to Carry it in the ships anymore
        - And you read that in the text, that's fine
        -  Water is heavy
        -  Okay, so
        - Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable
        -  Now the STUDENT has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water
        -  So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope
        - Some of our other answers
        - So let's look so STUDENT, you said that the small machine
        -  You said the microscope
        - Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and STUDENT
        -  And we have a microscope
        - So we're looking so we've narrowed it down
        -  We have our small machine
        - Very true
        -  So, so we know that ice is the water
        -  Okay, so that's very good
        -  We're going to keep that in the back of our brains
        -  We know that the water that we find is very small
        - Okay, very good
        -  So where we're thinking about how small the water is
        - Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again
        -  So we know STUDENT oh sorry Oliver and Farrah, let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon
        -  Right?
        - Right
        -  So, very good, very good
        - Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space
        -  So we have water we have equipment
        - And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title
        - Why the microscope is not the answer
        - Very good
        -  So it comes first in the story
        -  And then we use the microscope to identify the water
        - Hey kiddos
        -  And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable
        -  I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable
        -  So looking at Question two
        -  We can also use the oxygen for breathing
        - Absolutely
        -  STUDENT, we can use the water for drinking
        - And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now
        -  And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important
        - Right, so we can use it to breathe as well
        -  We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what
        - Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it
        -  I think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do all these different things, especially if we can put a moon base on the moon
        - So I think, I think you guys have it
        - Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one
        - and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic
        - You are welcome and, STUDENT, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Right?
        - Yeah, so, STUDENT, you talked about the microscope
        -  So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in STUDENT You had mentioned equipment they had been used
        - One question for you guys
        - Yeah
        -  And so, so we know the water, the water is there
        -  Right
        -  I mean, STUDENT you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon
        -  So that was two of the ways that they could use it
        -  And as the fuel if they break it into two parts
        - So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink
        - Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic
        -  The question is this
        -  Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads
        - Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer
        -  So you have the same answer As STUDENT
        -  That's great
        -  You do use a microscope to actually see the water
        -  So I'd like to dress you both at the same time
        - So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was
        -  So we know that they sent up that small machine and STUDENT, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water
        - And STUDENT, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So I think you guys are on the right track with that and then STUDENT and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used
        -  STUDENT
        -  So it looks like so far, STUDENT, and Jazmin
        - Okay, that's a good job
        -  You guys have both talked about equipment
        -  And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail
        -  So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine
        - Sure
        -  STUDENT
        - They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        -  Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon
        - You're right
        - So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can
        - They don't have to put that water on the rocket
        -  So you're right that water isn't ready yet
        - Like what you've done, you got to that last paragraph, where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water
        -  They're going to have to STUDENTelop a plan to extract water so it can be used
        -  And I love how you guys are trying to think about this
        -  Both of these things up
        -  So let me help you with this
        -  Okay
        - You are so close
        -  You're telling me that I can split
        - To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon
        -  We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen
        -  So hydrogen and oxygen
        -  STUDENT You said that those two elements are can be broken apart
        -  Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart
        - Mr
        - You're left with hydrogen and oxygen
        - Yes, correct
        -  And, and then I loved and STUDENT, you said that there was craters full of water on the moon
        - And STUDENT told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet
        - Okay, now, so
        -  Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do
        - It is very heavy
        - now, STUDENT, and Oliver you guys mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water
        -  STUDENT, you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon
        - let's think about oxygen
        - yeah so you guys kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there
        - mm hmm so you and STUDENT had the same idea
        - STUDENT and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and Farrah thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it
        - Okay STUDENT so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right
        - Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right
        - Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right
        - And we'll start with a STUDENT this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct
        - that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah
        - Okay, so STUDENT and Farrah you guys did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um
        - So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine STUDENT, but Farrah was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope
        - So we're using your background knowledge on the word
        - equipment
        - And like tool you like
        - So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct
        - Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff
        - Awesome
        -  And STUDENT your response was just comparing to Farrah is which was a great point
        -  She was absolutely correct
        -  Thank you
        - Thanks guys alright so STUDENT we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs
        - so we know that STUDENT said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin
        - So STUDENT and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned -actually Luis you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used
        -  STUDENT you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so Luis yes
        - So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with STUDENT
        - let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to STUDENT's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did
        - so, as I was just saying to STUDENT she said that for in the future astronauts can
        - Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon STUDENT
        - That is STUDENT and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a Oliver
        -  Don't you?
        - Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space
        - You think it's the microscope
        - yeah so STUDENT and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you
        - yeah a STUDENT is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine
        - i'm seeing a pattern here, we all like the microscope in the orbiter
        - All right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and I want you to miss one you said I circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?
        - But what we did with STUDENT
        -  If you remember, if I had STUDENT Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really
        - Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more
        - and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because
        - If they do have that room on the ship, it would be very valuable because they could store more things, which is what it says in
        - The text so that's a great response
        - so you said okay well STUDENT said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the
        - i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon
        - awesome okay so STUDENT looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so
        - awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?
        - So, STUDENT you answered with NASA send a small machine
        -  So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine
        -  And that tells me that you understood it
        -  And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it
        - OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about
        - Awesome
        -  Good job
        -  That's, that's really good
- intent: r110.2
  examples: |
        - Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        - You're all right
        -  It is, I didn't say it was wrong
        - It is
        - The only person STUDENT is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable
        -  Um, we definitely need oxygen
        - Okay
        -  When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here
        - Your, your answer is not wrong
        - You need a microscope to be able
        - To see it
        -  You could if there's enough water
        - That is true
        - Well, STUDENT, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct
        - STUDENT I want to go back to your answer
        -  You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  And that is very, very true,
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water,
        - I like the connection you made there
        -  All right
        -  I'm so glad that you could clarify
        -  That's great
        -  Thank you
        - Yes
        - That's right
        -  So you weren't wrong at all
        - They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water
        - Orbiter
        -  They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here
        -  Good job
        -  So you said
        -  Okay
        - I don't
        -  Your answer isn't wrong
        - You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question
        -  Right?
        - They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?
        - Uh huh
        -  That's a good connection STUDENT
        -  Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you guys read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right
        -  Good job
        - Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely
        -  So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely
        - Your answer is not wrong
        -  Okay
        -  You're right about that
        - Oh, right
        -  So, it is a small machine that is correct
        -  So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space
        -  You are correct
        - Right
        - Exactly
        -  And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out
        -  And I did
        -  Awesome job
        - And STUDENT once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well
        -  So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text
        - Exactly, exactly
        - Right
        -  And that is correct
        - That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts STUDENT
        - I think what STUDENT Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text
        -  Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon
        -  So, you are right
        - Your answer is not wrong
        -  That's a very good answer
        - Very good
        - Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water
        -  So yes, that's something really good to add STUDENT
        -  STUDENT?
        -  Thank you
        - And I see it's the microscope
        -  Very good, very good
        -  Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        -  You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this
        - Absolutely, absolutely
        - And I think STUDENT did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that
        -  Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon
        -  It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so STUDENT talk
        - Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading
        - Now, they discovered the water
        -  You got that right on the nose
        - I would say that a lot better answers the question
        -  And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect
        -  We might include how those
        -  So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        -  I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there
        - You got a lot closer there
        -  That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right
        - Right, good
        -  What is that small machine called
        - A small machine, right, perfect
        -  So, which is a good thing
        - So you're both right
        -  That's great about working in groups
        -  We all participate and contribute
        -  You just didn't have the--
        - Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and STUDENT good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours
        -  So you're both right
        -  So they did using what they,
        -  I liked your answers
        -  Scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Well, good
        - You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air
        -  And if you don't have the heavy water
        -  Right
        - Okay, and STUDENT
        -  Your answer is not wrong
        - Yes, STUDENT
        -  Your answer was never wrong STUDENT's original answer was that scientist
        -  So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong
        -  You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - That's a very good point
        -  And they did
        - I would like to see if STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Oh, that would be awesome
        -  That is very good thinking
        - Yes, that is correct
        - And no one's answer is wrong
        -  Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further
        - Very good
        -  So, STUDENT
        - Well, it's not wrong
        - but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question
        - And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes
        - but you guys were right there at it so so
        -  Did you know the name of this orbiter?
        -  That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before
        -  I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks
        - Yeah a lot
        -  So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe
        - Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space
        -  So that was one equipment that they did use
        -  There's not a lot of oxygen
        - Well, that was right too
        - Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something
        - We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but
        - So I mean he's not wrong,
        - Perfect
        -  Okay, STUDENT
        -  Excellent
        -  Okay, thank you
        - Okay, they use several types of of of equipment
        - Exactly
        - Okay, I am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong
        -  Your everybody's answer is
        - Your answer is very right they did use a microscope
        - Let's figure answers STUDENT, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely
        - That is equipment, you're correct
        -  They have to use all those things before they can start their explorations
        -  That is right STUDENT
        - We're getting a little bit off topic here, but STUDENT you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that
        - It would and it would be really useful too
        -  STUDENT What about you
        -  So it might not be worked at
        - But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money
        -  STUDENT
        - I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words
        -  So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?
        -  We're just wanting to find kind of even more
        -  No
        -  No, your answer isn't wrong
        -  No
        -  OK? About it
        - Oh, I didn't say that
        -  So they sent mall machine
        -  You're exactly right
        -  That's the tool that we're looking for
        -  Yes
        -  That's right
        -  That's very good
        -  That's right
        -  I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer
        - Oh, good
        -  STUDENT
        - That is correct
        - And it does say that, um, does it
        -  So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?
        - Yes, it was the microscope
        -  Does everybody see where STUDENT found that in paragraph three?
        - Good job, STUDENT
        -  Did everybody hear that while STUDENT was reading
        - That was a wonderful answer
        -  Does anyone else want to add their answer to it
        - Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool
        -  Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as
        - Yeah
        -  Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong
        -  Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong
        - Cute
        - Your answer is not wrong, STUDENT
        -  Well, I don't think that you're wrong
        - A small machine
        - And so it's not that your answer is incorrect,
        -  So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon,
        - Right
        - Your answer is correct
        - Correct they did have to use the equipment so STUDENT and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters
        -  Okay
        - I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means
        -  So you answer that that NASA send a small machine
        - Maybe your answer is right
        -  And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there
        - I didn't say your answer was wrong
        -  So your answer was right
        - That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine
        - It's not that your answers are wrong
        - Right, so they
        -  Those are different types of equipment that scientists use
        -  So you guys are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water
        - So STUDENT
        -  You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean
        -  Good job
        - You're right
        -  You did a great job with with understanding what water is even
        -  How can it be valuable for us on the moon
        -  Those are great job, guys
        - Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake
        -  Thank you
        - And that is a great answer
        - I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct
        - Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon
        -  So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon
        - But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - just like STUDENT brought up about space
        -  He knows this is not just about equipment but about space
        -  He's looking into it
        - When I looked over your answer
        -  It wasn't that it wasn't wrong
        -  It is what it is
        -  There was some great points you brought about it
        -  So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate STUDENT, you said it again?
        -  And that's a good connection
        - Great
        - I like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever I asked you about the garden
        -  What makes you think you could, and you're telling me
        - I thought that was a great idea to be you
        -  Look at that
        -  I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy
        - Great
        -  And there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had
        - Okay
        -  Yes, good response
        -  So maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water,
        - Okay, you know what, STUDENT I
        -  That sounds like a good point
        - And we all gave really good answers
        - So your, your answer is not wrong
        -  Does that help you understand more
        -  I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it
        -  So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon
        - But nothing's wrong with your paragraph
        - This pretty good, but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does
        - That's absolutely true so far
        - So right now, your answer seems pretty solid
        - So, STUDENT, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect
        -  Your answer's your answer is correct
        - Yeah, that's a great point
        -  STUDENT
        -  So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon
        -  So yeah, you would need that equipment
        - STUDENT your answer is not necessarily wrong
        - You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong
        - And that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that
        -  Again, true
        - Yes, you, you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon
        - So I think you guys
        -  You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and
        - Are exactly right
        -  So, uh, equipment is a tool
        - The small machine are both equipment they are tools
        -  And in fact, our article today discusses the importance of oxygen
        -  And I appreciate you sharing that with us
        - And that is absolutely correct
        - So STUDENT your answer That they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer
        -  And it is mentioned here in the text
        - You did, um
        - So you were extremely, extremely close
        -  They didn't use machinery
        -  I think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong
        -  You were
        - I'm not saying I'm not saying it's wrong
        - You weren't wrong after all
        - It's not wrong
        -  So like STUDENT said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon
        - Very good
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        -  Your answer isn't wrong
        -  All right, STUDENT, and it's not wrong
        -  STUDENT Can you share what you underlined in paragraph two,
        -  All right
        -  Okay
        - Okay well we're going to get to that in one second
        -  We're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it
        - So you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true
        - Exactly, exactly
        -  We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water
        - So in essence kind of both of them are correct
        - In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it
        - You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything
        -  I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct
        - Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct
        - Yeah, so I would say based on our text here, they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon
        -  You look at paragraph three, you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope
        - Good job, STUDENT is exactly right
        - In fact, it is the microscope and part of the answers is right, it is the microscope
        -  And your answer is right
        - I will say, STUDENT
        - Hmm, I suppose it's in a large polar crater, right? Okay now your answer is correct, they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit
        - Okay, now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules
        -  Right?
        - With your answer is not wrong
        -  STUDENT?
        - Okay, so that could be a one use of water
        - So I love how you found that a microscope was used to find water,
        - You use those
        - It's not wrong
        - so you said you are 100% correct and it said NASA send a small machine
        - Everybody's answer was correct
        - I don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all
        -  It was a small machine
        - but you guys all gave answers that were very valid
        - yeah it was a good answer
        - yeah no that's a very well STUDENTeloped answer
        - but as long as we gathered all of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct, whether or not you think it is or not
        -  So, STUDENT
        -  I really did enjoy your answer
        -  You really picked up from the text and
        - I'm just going to go one by one
        -  I just want to start with you
        - You really picked the object, which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that I really appreciate it
        - Yeah
        -  You're right
        -  Your answer was right that the scientists did find craters full water on the moon
        - I don't think your answer is wrong, we did read that you do need a Microscope to look closely at the moon, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        -  I just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong
        - And STUDENT
        - yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon
        - Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water
        -  That's something we always want to keep with us
        - So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which - that's a great piece of knowledge
        - Alright awesome STUDENT I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon
        - So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for
        - um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon, they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes
        - equipment that you find whether it's in the text, or you think of it in your head
        - Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to
        - It is
        - yeah absolutely good job
        -  But yeah, this was a good start
        -  Yeah, good foundation
        - So yeah, that's kind of how you could have done it
        - You your applied to it was scientists found creators, full of water on the moon, so your sentence isn't wrong and you bring up a good point that
        - um the scientists found for creators, full of water on the moon on
        - So yeah just kind of thinking about more like that, but you did great you know it was it was a good answer you did awesome i'm
        - wow you're you're a super right and that was perfect timing, because your classmate STUDENT his his sentence was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank so two great minds think alike, am I right
        - i'm so STUDENT for your sentence, I have seen anything terrible wrong with it, but
        - yeah um but other than that I, I thank you guys, like all the guys, I think I understood the passages like Well, yes, that
        - yeah that's awesome I see it, right in the second paragraph NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer
        - Right
        -  OK, now that is correct
        -  I want to make that very clear
        -  We're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right
        -  No one's wrong
        - All right, no one's wrong
        -  So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why
        - That's right
        -  You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need
        - You're right on what you said
        - Answer is not wrong
        - So your answers not wrong
        - microscope yep that's right
        - Yeah, you are correct
        -  STUDENT
        - Actually, I think I agree with savannas answer
        - I don't necessarily think any one answer was
        - Just outright wrong,
        - So thank you for sharing Thank you
        - That is really, really cool information, and I know the text references oxygen tanks, too, so that is really awesome for you to bring up Thank you STUDENT
        - yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um
        -  They did send a small machine
        - Because, well your answer is not wrong
        -  You're definitely
        -  Well, you guys are all definitely right with your answers that you guys that they did use a microscope
        -  You guys all had responses that were definitely
        -  So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon
        - That's really, really cool
        -  Yes, STUDENT, you said you circled the same as Farrah
        - You guys were all mostly right in your responses
        - And that's right, STUDENT did choose a correct objects,
        - I understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon, but
        - you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right
        - you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great
        - Again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that
        - Alright, so I know this is a little smaller and I wanted to explain to you guys that before you get worried, I want you guys, to know that your responses were all great
        - Your answer is totally correct everybody has correct answers in this group
        - STUDENT your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct
        -  STUDENT, the scientists did find craters with ice in them
        - And that is true
        - And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct,
        -  I think all of you answer the questions
        -  I don't think any of your answers are wrong
        - Oh so STUDENT I let's clarify
        - I'm with a different type of answer, but I don't think any of your questions were wrong
        -  How are we doing so your response was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is completely true
        - All right, STUDENT
        -  So that's really great
        - Instruments, they used to find the water, which was microscope
        - So let's see your answer was NASA sent a small machine
        -  That answer is not incorrect at all, and I think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case I just think
        - When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct
        - um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water
        -  That is perfectly correct STUDENT and I don't think your answers wrong I just think
        - Right, you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer
        -  So that answers the question
        -  Nice work!
        - Right
        -  What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  That's great
        - So I don't think your answers wrong, I think you have a really, really great start to a strong response so in the text, it does actually say NASA sent a small machine
        - So I think that's a great start yeah awesome
        - Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for
        -  They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like
        - backed up why you said, because if you had just said that you put creator down I probably would have marked it as a wrong answer, but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water, it is a very good
        - it's a very good thought
        - Yeah, they definitely use those
        - It's not wrong at all
        - So that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses
        -  Yes
        -  STUDENT
        -  It had all the great all the good pieces in it,
- intent: r230.1
  examples: |
        - i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer
        - STUDENT why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said
        - All right, STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine
        - would be, can you tell me more about this small machine does
        - STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did
        - Okay, so STUDENT you had the same answer is Farrah, can you tell me why you put that answer as well
        - yeah so STUDENT you're right Those are all great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer
        - All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers STUDENT, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer
        - STUDENT and Oliver you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer
        - say more, why is it the answer to the question STUDENT
        - STUDENT was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different
        -  And does anyone know
        -  Can someone tell me what discover means?
        - That is absolutely correct
        -  We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words
        -  And what are those two different things
        -  What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson
        - Yeah
        -  And then we'll talk about the answer
        - Why are you confused
        - Right
        -  So did you say you have a new answer
        - STUDENT and were you a person who said no
        -  Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind
        -  Why would a microscope, help us see the water
        - Excellent
        - Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small
        - Can you tell me more?
        -  Aside from the question itself
        - Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting
        -  Is that what you said
        - You didn't find that in the reading
        - Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?
        -  Hey, STUDENT can you tell me a little bit more why you like Farrahs answer
        -  All right
        - I like the connection you made there
        - Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?
        - Thank you so much for reading
        -  So, STUDENT, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?
        - Why did you write down the answer that you did
        - OK, and STUDENT why did you, why did you put down the same thing in Farrah was your mind going the same way as hers?
        - I saw where STUDENT
        -  What made you change your answer
        -  Where you revised your answer
        -  what made you change your mind
        -  What made you change your answer?
        - So STUDENT
        - Okay, STUDENT and you revised you're in
        -  Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that
        -  So you put that the water
        -   What made you change to change your answer
        - What did you change your answer to
        - You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice
        - Can you list off some equipment that they used
        -  So I'd like to start with STUDENT
        - What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there
        -  So let's hear your answer
        -  And how do you think you got to that answer
        -  You could give me one moment, STUDENT, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on
        - That's okay
        -  STUDENT, absolutely you can
        - What were you looking for?
        - Well, let's look at what made you think of that
        -  And what led you that answer
        - Yeah
        - And how did you gather that information
        -  Did you read our passage
        - So STUDENT
        - And STUDENT then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah
        -  Will you tell me where you found your answer
        - What do you think
        - STUDENT What are you thinking
        - Okay, so let's talk about that
        -  STUDENT, did, why did you answer your question by using, by saying the words
        -  What made you say that
        - Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can
        - Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water
        -  Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        - She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small
        - Yes, that is what they sent
        -  And STUDENT, what did they investigate when they got there?
        - What would that be valuable
        - So why did you guys think that what was your opinion about that
        -  Well,
        -  Like, how did you come up with your answer
        - STUDENT, could you explain your answer to the rest of the group
        - All right, STUDENT
        -  I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and STUDENT try and explain why you picked microscope?
        - Well, STUDENT if you already know a lot about space
        -  Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did
        -  So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable
        - But I'm a little concerned with STUDENT and Oliver on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence
        -  Did you understand
        - Okay, so, STUDENT
        -  You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  Did you understand you answer?
        - Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        -  What did you understand
        - You understand that answer?
        -  Can you share with your, your students STUDENT
        - Yeah, how did you come up with that answer
        - Can you tell me a little bit more about that
        - Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine
        -  And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?
        - So that's one thing that they used
        - What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that STUDENT?
        -  How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - And why is that a big deal
        - Like what?
        - Okay so STUDENT, they do use microscopes right?
        - Right
        -  And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?
        - Do you know if it had
        - A more specific name
        - Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name
        - What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure
        -  So how can that make it valuable
        - and STUDENT Can you tell me a little bit about your answer
        -  You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment
        - All right, STUDENT
        -  So you talked about
        - and STUDENT
        -  Why did you, why did you look for
        -  Why did you say that they use small machines
        -  So you specified that they use small machines
        - So why did you say they use microscopes
        - Okay, very good
        -  Why did you say not for a long time
        -  You said no because not not for a long time
        - So, STUDENT, the water can be
        -  You said that water can be split into two parts
        -  Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts
        - Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question
        -  What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water
        -  So that would be good
        - Mm hmm
        - STUDENT, you talk to me about water being heavy
        -  Why did you choose to talk to me about that
        -  Why did you say they're not ready yet
        - They you said they're not ready yet
        - Okay, so it lands where?
        - So, STUDENT, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome
        -  Can you tell me what that means
        - Okay, so it is an equipment
        -  What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?
        -  How did you get to that answer
        - So when you are listening and answering this question
        - Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope
        - Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer
        -  What made that microscope stick out to you
        -  And what made you think about the craters on the moon
        - Very good
        - Wow, what were you using it to find?
        -  So let's talk about that just a little bit
        - Yeah
        -  So what made you choose that as your answer
        - Will you tell me what what
        - your thought process was for answering that
        -  What made you choose that word
        - What made you choose the word microscope
        -  Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else
        - I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger
        - So that is true
        -  It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that
        - You kind of both have very similar responses
        -  It's not ready yet
        -  So STUDENT Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no
        - So we need to figure out yours and STUDENT's
        -  So what do you mean by that
        - You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time
        -  Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?
        -  So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time
        -  How come you do that
        - So STUDENT, I see that you had circled the same answer as Farrah
        - So did you find that on your own prior to STUDENT writing that or did you kind of just copy that?
        -  It says, NASA send a small machine
        -  What was the name of that small machine
        - And then if you look at STUDENT's answer
        - Or how did you come to that conclusion
        -  Okay
        -  Can you explain what you mean by that
        -  Now, STUDENT, you said you circled the same response as Farrah
        - Good
        - Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion
        - Why do you think that
        - But if they could get to it
        -  What do you think
        -  And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it
        -  And why do you think that
        -  Right
        - STUDENT, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated
        -  Why is that true?
        - Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right
        - Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?
        - Say that we do have enough money
        -  And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?
        - So, STUDENT, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water
        -  You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope
        -  Why would they need to use a microscope
        - So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used
        -  What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence
        -  And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence
        - Right, right, STUDENT
        - Equipment water
        -  Okay, why did you circle equipment
        -  And why did you circle discover
        -  All right
        - Discover
        - Oh
        -  So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon
        - How did you know that water's heavy
        - What is it you know about space
        -  STUDENT But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon
        -  Thank you
        -  Now I did notice STUDENT and Oliver had the same response
        - Okay, so that sounds good
        -  So let's go back and look at our responses here
        -  So which one of you would like to explain your response
        -  So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this group, though
        - Okay, so I STUDENT so you think are you know a lot about space
        -  Let's see
        - Okay, so what's confusing you STUDENT
        - Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine
        -  What is it called
        - Okay, so what is, what is that thing
        - What do you know about microscopes
        - How is it used on the moon
        - Well, does it pertain to our article?
        - and how do you know this
        - Okay
        -  Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay
        -  So when you say the small machine
        -  Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?
        -  Do you know that phrase
        - And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before
        - Okay
        -  Do you know what a microscope is
        - Why do you think equipment is the most important word
        -  Why do you think water is the most important question or word
        - Water now STUDENT
        - All right
        -  And what do you have figured out
        - What are you confused about
        - Why do you think it is a valuable resource STUDENT
        - That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean
        - If we can refill up on the moon
        - What do you think that would mean
        - Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read?
        - Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title
        - Good job
        -  STUDENT, what made you come up with your answer choice
        -  How did you come up with that answer
        - STUDENT, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon
        -  Why did you underline discover
        - Okay, Justin
        - So I saw responses and STUDENT
        -  My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is STUDENT
        -  So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me
        - What do you say that
        - Wondering about that
        -  In what way
        -  Um, STUDENT, how did you come up with your answer
        - Hello
        -  So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT, what do you have to say about your answer
        - STUDENT
        -  What are you thinking
        - Okay, I'm going to start with STUDENT Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah
        - So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks
        -  You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Let's look at yours
        -  Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer
        - STUDENT
        -  So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer
        - STUDENT
        -  Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - What do you believe it means
        - Okay, great
        -  So what made you choose those two words
        - They need a small machine
        -  Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine
        - And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read
        - Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question
        -  Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen
        - And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer
        - Why does that make water valuable
        - and why does that make it valuable
        -  What's your thinking there
        - Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?
        - Do you remember what that machine was
        -  What is the microscope D
        - Awesome
        - Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon
        - What were those two parts that you said
        - Okay, so, um, Miss STUDENT, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  What do you know about a microscope
        -  Does anybody, anyone have the specific name of the machine?
        - Okay, so yes, they used a small machine
        - You want to explain that?
        - Mmmhmm, about what?
        - Not for a long time, why do you think not, for a long time
        - Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident
        - So where are you confused STUDENT
        -  That was really good
        -  However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?
        - That -you did discover that they use oxygen tanks
        - That was a great answer so STUDENT you circle, the same as Farrah what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used
        - What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon
        - Now STUDENT your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used
        - i'm so STUDENT your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz
        - STUDENT, why did you circle
        -  The same thing that STUDENT didn't
        - What was your reason
        - and, why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - and also how was your answer answering the question
        - yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - You do?
        - Can you explain what that means
        - Why did you circle the last sentence?
        - Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that
        - You could say, can you explain what you mean
        - Teacher:but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer
        - yeah what are you confused about telling me
        - What won't be ready
        - And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Can I just ask you what made you say that
        - So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that
        - And STUDENT
        -  Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question
        - Can I ask you why, if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer
        - Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？
        - Did you work with Savannh on this question?
        - Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that
        - Did you work with STUDENT on the question
        - Can you elaborate on that response
        -  You're using each other to help one another
        -  Do you need me to to re explain it
        -  What did you fully understand this question
        -  I mean, you were all working in a small group which is great
        -  But why did you circle, the same thing as STUDENT
        -  Why did you think it is a right answer?
        - So, STUDENT
        -  I see that you said that you
        - Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said
        - and STUDENT so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as Farrah?
        - Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools
        - So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?
        -  What is, what does that mean to you, why did you highlight that answer
        - So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Can you explain a little bit more
        -  Why you circle that
        - All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer STUDENT could you tell me what the answer was
        - For a couple of you guys so deb could you go more in depth with your answer, I know you did circle, the same as STUDENT, but I want to know why you did, or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah
        - awesome So what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly
        - Okay i'm STUDENT Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking
        - STUDENT do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house
        - I just was wondering, so you said no, not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well, I don't
        - Okay, what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah
        -  So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So let's actually go to you now, STUDENT
        -  What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?
        -  STUDENT, I see that you were talking about a small machine
        -  Is that the machine you were talking about?
        - Perfect, great
        -  I want to know a lot more of what you know about it
        -  So tell me about the machine
        -  I would just like to hear a little bit more detail
        - It's not wrong at all
        - That's really cool, I love that
        -  Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at all when you were at NASA?
        - The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the
        - Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer
        - Good and how did you come to that conclusion
        - Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that
        - Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to STUDENT, can you tell me
        - Why it's not ready
        - So what makes you think
        -  What did you, why did you circle those things?
        - You wrote the same thing
        - What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it
        -  So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that
        -  So you and STUDENT kind of have similar responses
        - Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life
        - What makes you think you got all figured out
        - So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text
        - What made you say that
        - What are you confused about
        - So, in your answer, why did you choose that
        - it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking
        - Really, so do you think they could use the Lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah
        - So let's STUDENT, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon
        - Why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  How did you get to that answer?
        -  So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  We're going to start with you
        -  So STUDENT, I see that you just answered the same as Farrah
        -  Did you read the article
        - Okay
        - Mm hmm
        -  Does it say what the name of the small machine is
        -  Very good
        -  Can you elaborate on that
        -  I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head
        - Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more
        -  And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts
        - Excellent
        - Either you can explain why did you circle that
        - So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it
        -  Think in your brain
        -  What made you answer that
        - But while I do that I was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer
        -  When you read the question what relied talk me through it
        - Well, first, STUDENT, before I became um what made you think that was the correct answer
        -  So I was wondering, what can you talk me through your answer
        -  Okay, it's STUDENT
        - Awesome
        - So STUDENT
        -  Can you talk me through your answer really quick
        - Why do you think that
        - Do you know what this machine is called
        - How did you guys arrive that you're thinking
        -  I'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer
        -  I like
        - STUDENT I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut
        - What do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable
        - Um, can you tell me more about this
        - Can anyone tell me how it feels, answering these opinion questions
        - And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  Why did you circle equipment
        - Why did you say equipment
        - Discover okay why discover?
        - Do you have a name for the small machine
        - Um, I know that does sound funny
        -  So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope
        -  But do you know why that is
        - Yeah, jazz STUDENT's answer was right
        - Let me ask STUDENT
        -  Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer
        -  And what made you say that
        - Okay, awesome
        -  STUDENT
        - Oh, okay
- intent: r420.2
  examples: |
        - Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer 
        - Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific STUDENT because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine
        - Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific
        - you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does
        - But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read
        - So take a second and write a new answer yes, STUDENT
        - Yes, STUDENT, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as Farrah, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her
        - So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail
        -  But they, It was a small machine
        - Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer
        - We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence
        - To discover the water
        -  So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer
        -  So I know where your answer came from
        - Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as STUDENT, but if you could find that in the text and circle it
        -  That would be awesome
        - I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me
        - STUDENT
        -  Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine
        -  Did you find that in the text?
        -  They called it a microscope
        -  That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now
        - Looking into and finding it for the first time
        - Can you look for that for me
        - Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question
        -  Right
        - You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth
        -  So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher
        -  You want to make sure I'm in for sure
        - Then I'm kind of in the dark
        -  Right
        -  Right
        -  So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer
        -  I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there
        - But it may be a smaller amount
        -  Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon
        - I think we can be a little more specific in your response
        -  Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there
        -  So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely
        - Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends
        - And we're very specific when we're writing
        -  That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are
        - A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way
        - And I think we can kind of change how that sets up
        -  So you could say, NASA
        -  I think would convey your meeting
        - Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically
        -  Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those
        - Yeah
        -  Correct
        -  So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring
        - So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine
        -  Right
        -  Well, that'd be a good strategy
        - So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more
        - However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like STUDENT learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right
        -  And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text STUDENT
        - Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer
        - But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need
        - How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon
        - So I think you would have your sentence was great
        -  Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable
        - Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text
        - I'm STUDENT, you wrote that NASA send a small machine
        -  That's very good
        -  So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called
        -  Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text
        - So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with STUDENT
        -  Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this
        -  And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence
        -  Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT
        - Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen
        -  Now let's go a little bit further with that answer
        - Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope
        -  So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it
        - But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does
        - So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable
        - But we want to say give like an a yes or no question
        -  If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving
        - They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart
        - Maybe, but you can also use the passage
        -  Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable
        -  Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more
        -  He said it could be useful because it can be broken down
        - Yeah, and that's what STUDENT said
        - And said what is valuable about breaking it down
        - That's the only thing I would have done
        - So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your
        -  Thank you, them
        - Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words
        - Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question
        -  What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you
        - Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine
        - So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer
        -  STUDENT
        -  You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total
        -  You're right
        -  Okay
        -  So your answer is almost there
        -  So NASA send a small machine
        -  It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - STUDENT your answer
        -  You just need to add a little bit more information to it
        -  So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay
        -  But sometimes we have to look around too
        - Yeah, sometimes that works
        -  Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article
        -  STUDENT
        -  So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation
        -  So we have to describe that
        - Exactly
        - Right
        -  But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?
        - No
        -  So we have to name it
        -  So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers
        - Right
        -  Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? STUDENT?
        -  It could be a machine
        -  It can be, words like machine or a tool
        - Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment
        - It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer
        - We need to restate that question in our answers
        -  Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question
        - Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment
        -  So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it
        - So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer
        -  So we could say
        -  It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it
        - The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter
        -  Yeah
        -  And yeah guys, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and
        - You did, and quite a few details
        -  Okay
        - Wonderful
        -  Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible
        -  So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment
        -  So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence
        - You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do
        -  Does that make sense
        - You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right
        - Possibly
        -  Do you guys understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers
        - So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response
        - Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is
        - So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable
        - And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it
        -  Does that help better explain it to you STUDENT
        - So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible
        - Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question
        -  You got to make sure you add all of your details, does that help?
        -  And when you answer your question
        -  What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine
        - So you could be looking for something more specific
        -  So when you're reading
        -  So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        -  You could you should name that machine
        - And looking for a specific question
        - In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to
        - To answer them
        -  So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks
        -  If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it
        -  The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines
        -  And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer
        - And the text
        -  Okay
        - And it answers the question better
        - You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here
        -  Like STUDENT, or a neighbor
        -  STUDENT, I see you have a question
        -  I want to hear what you found
        - So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it
        -  Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend
        -  Does that make sense
        -  We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be
        -  We can answer
        - Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers
        -  And so the more detail
        -  I mean, the more detail
        - but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day
        -  Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question
        -  And so maybe the substitute didn't have that
        -  Does that make sense
        - Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends
        -  Maybe if you working in partners of two
        -  So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific
        -  What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific
        -  So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that's the only thing I would add to yours
        - Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question
        -  Okay
        -  That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading
        - STUDENT
        -  So you could still say I agree with STUDENT, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her
        -  What is it that she picked that I agree with
        -  Does that make sense
        - Instead of just agreeing with STUDENT, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah
        - Yeah, okay
        -  Go ahead and think about why you might agree with STUDENT
        -  So if we rewrote our answers
        -  If we might do that in a minute
        - And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response
        - but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was
        - Alright, so, STUDENT, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer
        - So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be
        - So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose
        - So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific
        -  Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter
        -  I think for us to build on your answer
        -  We'd have a complete full answer to that question
        -  I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer
        -  So you have a good start
        - I think so
        - Yes, yes
        -  If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now
        -  And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just
        - but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right
        -  If we go back into the text
        - I but I think NASA
        -  We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer
        -  So looking in the text
        -  Where could we are, what could we add
        -  So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine
        -  You said NASA send a small machine
        - And so your answer
        - To expand
        - And give more details what top of small machine was it
        - I just, I would like to build more upon your answer
        - So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we all agree that is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  It's just what you think
        -  But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read
        - Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        -  Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true
        - So you don't want to have an opinion
        -  So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer
        -  Just be independent
        -  Not what STUDENT found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water
        - And STUDENT, I circled the same I Farrah
        -  Alright, so talk about what you found
        - And talk about yourself, not another student
        -  I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer
        - That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question
        - What would be helpful
        -  And what else, what identifies that machine
        - Yeah, tell me something about it
        -  So probably the machines name as well
        - Yeah, your name
        -  And just make sure your bringing it from the text
        - t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that
        - I love when students make the question
        -  Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer
        -  So what you'll do is
        - Yes
        -  So for example, you are going to restate the question
        -  So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that
        - Would say there is convinced
        -  There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Let me see you again, sorry
        -  So there you restated the question you answered the question
        - Then you would say in the text, what it says
        -  And then you would explain why that's important
        -  Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - The only thing I would like is just the restate the question
        -  You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it
        - Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon
        -  Can you guys and then you're off
        - And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you
        - Found the evidence from number six
        -  That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain
        -  So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question
        - Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought
        - I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good
        - See if you can find it
        - So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer
        -  Okay so y'all talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second
        - Yeah, so you and STUDENT
        -  Okay
        -  Y'all see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen
        - Okay
        -  Um, I have not heard that
        -  Did you have a question, your hand was up just a second ago
        -  Okay, so you and STUDENT and Chris Chris
        -  But let's think about this text, though
        -  But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter
        -  So STUDENT, you were on the right track
        - That is correct
        - And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?
        - talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to
        - That question by using the two words that you guys underlined as keywords
        - So STUDENT You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        -  How could you be more specific to the passage
        - Okay
        -  So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions
        - So I want you guys to look at the answer that you put for this question
        -  I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot
        -  You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name
        - Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer
        -  So that's when you would want to refer back to the text
        -  So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But yes, it's looking for something specific
        - That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask
        - Microscope and stuff like that
        -  But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer
        - We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon
        - I want you to help each other
        -  Understand the text
        -  And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you guys to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water
        - One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question
        -  So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you guys were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading
        - Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer
        -  Okay
        - Because we must always refer to the text
        -  The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel
        -  That's why it's valuable
        - but that detail you just added is critical
        -  So that's a great answer
        -  That's why it's valuable
        - So that second Part that you just gave me
        - So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned
        -  So we had to find evidence
        -  So we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions
        - Um, well, the question asked, according to the text
        -  So you might be right
        -  From what you know from your dad going to NASA, we have to use the text in order to answer the question
        - Yeah, you want to look back in the story and make sure you're answering the whole question that stories like your friend
        -  You want to keep looking back, and it has all your answers
        - And then STUDENT, I really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope, I would have loved
        -  If you give us another example, or maybe added on to Mars, Venus thought I definitely did like your answer and how you
        - Understand, maybe next time
        -  If you have the same idea someone, you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up
        - You could say that to like you can bring an example of
        -  Why do you think they're using microscopes
        -  Do you think it helped them to find the craters
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text
        -  Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process
        - I would have loved if you
        - Just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does
        -  Just like how you said previously, and then kind of
        - So what you could do is saying, NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter
        - They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that
        - might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple, like NASA said the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Yeah, like we should fill in the blanks, just to make our sentence a little Meteor
        - Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text
        -  Does that sound good?
        - You can always write that even scientists use a microscope
        -  Is that better?
        - But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see
        -  So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about
        - I just think that it sounds like you understand
        - Um, yes
        -  So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff
        - But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate
        -  So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks
        - Something specifically from the text
        -  Does that make sense
        - yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called
        - Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that
        - But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you
        - So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text
        - However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to STUDENT where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water
        - And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that
        - pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon
        - I would probably just expand your response, so you could
        - Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can
        - Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me
        - you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon
        -  Good job
        - I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start
        -  STUDENT
        - I think that you could have, you could have maybe expanded on a little more on instead of saying like I scientists found craters for water on the moon, you could maybe as is answer, while also kind of expanding upon it by like adding like blah blah blah
        -  I know it wasn't too long of a thing to read, so he couldn't really expand upon it as much
        -  You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box
        -  Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way
        - But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it
        -  I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box
        -  Your idea is not really working
        - So like when say like someone asked you to build a house right um and your ideas that you had before
        -  So you're kind of running out of ideas and sometimes thinking outside the box like instead of doing it like this normal approach like the typical way of doing it
        -  So the maybe expand on your point, which was a good point
        - The only thing I would say to add is maybe you could, because you said a lot of equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks
        -  You could say, like, they also use like special helmets and like a special like space suit or something like helmet
        - a suggestion I have for you
        - To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help
        - on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on
        - Pretty key to all this um
        - so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like
        - A reason why, like the thing that they found to be important in La um I know that's a lot,
        - A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say
        - NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them
        - So maybe like adding like a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence
        - But i'm just i'm hoping that you know that the challenge of having maybe a longer sentence or breaking it maybe breaking it into two
        - can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um
        - um okay um can you do, you tell me in your own words, why it's not ready, using using what's in the passage, but in your own words okay
        - I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse um so so STUDENT your answer was awesome like
        - um alright so STUDENT water, you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen great job on that um So could you kind of tell me why
        - Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen
        - um because, again, as I said, adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and
        - It was right
        -  But I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used
        -  There was us a little bit more details,
        -  I wish they had a little bit more details like for STUDENT and Jazmin
        - You guys had some really good responses for a couple of them
        - but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response
        -  So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it
        -  Does that sound good
        - Yeah, like your personal views, along with what you found from the text
        - But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views sound good
        - So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading
        -  So, STUDENT, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond
        -  Okay
        - Thank you
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now
        - That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more
        - what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task What you said is good but it's a little
        -  They use the equipment they use
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the machine
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use
        -  But so far, so good
        -  You realize that STUDENT had a good answer
        -  And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer
        - STUDENT
        - So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it
        -  Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on
        -  So you see how she said microscope
        -  They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water
        - Yeah, that's okay
        - You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text
        - Or if  you disagree or anything
        -  So we're not all saying the same things
        -  Just adding on to the discussion
        - My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response
        -  My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something
        - So I see where you agreed with STUDENT
        - It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track
        - Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start
        - I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer
        - Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly
        - Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully
        -  So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So what you want to say in your
        - Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment
        - Yeah, you have to write more stuff
        - We want to be using that
        - Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water
        -  Does that make sense
        - You have to add more words
        - You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific
        -  You want to use good examples from the text
        - so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers
        - So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer
        - So going back to what STUDENT said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine
        -  But what does it do? To answer the question in context
        - Right, so just that one little extra step
        -  That makes sense
        - Could really just push through your answer
        -  The second piece
        -  So you had part of the what you just needed
        - Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why
        - It's just we need more specifics
        -  You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read
        - Right
        -  So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics
        -  You need to be able to
        - So, STUDENT when you're looking at these answers
- intent: r120.3
  examples: |
        - And STUDENT Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?
        - Excellent and STUDENT could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle
        - And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around STUDENT, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one For the name of the equipment they use
        - Excellent STUDENT could you read the second paragraph, for us
        - STUDENT just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us
        - can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking STUDENT
        - One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me STUDENT
        - can you reread that chunk of the text for me
        - Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's all look back at our question
        -  Let's look back at number one
        -  Do you want to if you guys want to read this question for me
        - STUDENT, do you want to read it for me
        - So we are going to look back in our passage
        -  So I will everybody to get back into their passage
        - Okay
        -  Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        -  The water they found is microscopic
        - Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        -  If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - Go back to the text and look
        - The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate
        - Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment
        -  Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage
        -  Can you look at your passage with me
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters
        - And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        -  Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, STUDENT and and the group
        -  If you look at their paragraph four
        - So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?
        - Okay
        -  Would you like STUDENT, would you like to read the second paragraph?
        - So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?
        -  Can anybody tell me
        - Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        - Let's look back at the text
        - Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Can who can read that for sentence to me
        - Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot
        - Of work
        -  This would hold only 32 ounces of water
        - But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again
        - And I want to challenge, just like STUDENT, take a look at that question
        -  Can you read the question for me
        - Let me point you in the right direction
        -  Okay
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three
        -  Look at paragraph three
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        -  Again, STUDENT
        - Look at that question again
        - Can you read it out loud for me
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate
        - STUDENT, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph
        -  Question number one out loud for us
        -  Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read
        - Okay
        -  So could I have someone
        -  Will you read
        -  I saw your hand first
        -  Question number one for us, please
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  STUDENT, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence
        -  Can you, can everyone look back at number three on your document
        -  So let's see
        - Okay
        - I'm gonna stop you there
        -  We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        -  Can you do that for me?
        - All right, so, STUDENT, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading
        - so STUDENT, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?
        - So can you guys look back at paragraph two?
        - So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence
        - What does it say STUDENT?
        - Now, STUDENT, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?
        -  Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two
        - Let's see, STUDENT
        - And STUDENT
        -  Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        -  STUDENT It will you read the question back to me
        - But we look back at the question for me
        -  If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me
        - And then in the second paragraph, right there
        - Okay, so, but before we do that can STUDENT
        -  Will you read the question aloud to the group, please
        -  Would you read it aloud place
        - how about STUDENT Would you go back and read paragraph two for us
        -  STUDENT we read it to me one more time
        - So let's look at the question again
        - That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you
        -  So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now
        - So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response
        - So why don't you read that question for me again
        - Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so STUDENT wants to read the second question for us
        - So, but if we look on down in paragraph
        -  It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - In their paper with me
        - Okay, so everybody look at your paper
        -  STUDENT, can you just read that for me again
        -  Let's look at paragraph two
        -  What did you just just read it one more time for me
        -  STUDENT, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay
        -  So when you look back at your reading
        - And that they use equipment to search for things
        - The whole thing a paragraph two,
        - And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have STUDENT read that sentence for us
        -  Can you read the next sentence for me STUDENT
        - Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one
        -  And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three
        -  The water they found is, what's the word there?
        -  Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth
        - So if you look at paragraph number three
        -  I'm going to read it
        -  You follow along
        - Great response
        -  So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, STUDENT
        - Okay, and what else does it say about it
        - Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - All right
        -  Well, let's look at it together
        - Okay, let's see
        - Look at paragraph five,
        -  It says, water is a valuable resource
        -  I want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage
        - I want you to go back and look at the passage
        - STUDENT, are we rereading, make sure you're reading our passage
        -  This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day
        - Okay, so let's look back to paragraph
        -  So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource
        -  Let's see
        -  Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource
        - Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water
        -  Water is heavy
        -  And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - STUDENT
        -  Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon
        -  So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, STUDENT?
        - Right
        - But what does the first sentence say?
        -  Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those STUDENT, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine
        -  OK
        - Yes, those are great equipment words
        -  Awesome
        -  So can some, STUDENT or one of you, which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1?
        - Good
        -  Paragraph 1
        - Yes
        -  Go ahead, STUDENT
        -  Absolutely
        -  Are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert?
        -  Let see
        - Good
        -  Did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three? And then we'll talk about those four answers
        -  Let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3
        - OK
        - Yes
        -  So paragraph 3
        -  Who would like to read 3? STUDENT, would you like to read it?
        -  Very good
        -  But that's a very good start
        -  So let's keep reading paragraph 3, and then we're going to go back, and we're going it's kind of getting more information, OK
        -  Good
        -  Who would like to read three?
        - So paragraph three
        - So in the text, I think it was in
        - In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah
        -  Other questions, man
        - Oh gosh, remind me
        -  And while you're reading it
        - So read that sentence again for me
        -  I'm going to talk with STUDENT
        -  Let's all look at our text
        - and in our text when we look at our texts
        - So what machine was used to find the water
        - So I think we all need to reread the passage
        -  Okay, one more time
        -  I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again
        -  Okay
        - All right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?
        -  Now, STUDENT
        -  Yes
        - So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine
        -  So we're going to move down to paragraph number three
        -  Can you all find paragraph number three
        - Okay, awesome
        - So let's look back at
        - paragraphs three and four specifically
        -  Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute
        - A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk
        -  How's that sound
        - As a group, look back at paragraphs three and four
        -  Okay
        -  So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - The beginning of paragraph two, okay
        -  Let's look back individually
        - Let's look back, I'll give you guys about a minute or so individually
        -  So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits
        - Okay, yeah
        -  Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Let's look back at the text
        -  Okay
        -  So if you look at our original question
        -  Let's go back and Decode that question
        - Perfect
        - That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs
        - But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon
        -  Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,
        - water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Everybody look back with us and STUDENT read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine
        -  What do you see there?
        - Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read
        -  You could look at the sentence
        - It says rocket fuel
        -  It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways
        -  The second part where waters valuable resource
        - The part of the paragraph
        -  The article
        -  Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer
        - I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so STUDENT
        - Well, why would finding water on the moon useful
        - But if we go back in the text, and we just need to clarify
        - Teacher:STUDENT can We go to paragraph two,
        - Very first in its
        - STUDENT Can you read the second sentence and paragraph two,
        - but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading
        -  And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us
        -  Can I get you to read the question
        - STUDENT
        - All right
        -  Can I get STUDENT to read the question for us, please
        - Okay, so let's go back at a our article, so everybody look at your article
        -  Okay
        -  STUDENT, you had a great question there
        - All right, who would like to read the first part there
        - Can I get you to do it, STUDENT
        - Alright, STUDENT read that, the number one
        - Great
        -  All right, who would like to read number two
        - Okay, let's let STUDENT, will you read number two
        -  Can I get you to read number three
        - Alright, STUDENT
        - You, why don't you go ahead you and STUDENT, why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon
        - Teacher:And then also I would like you
        -  So can you read back the question for me
        -  We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question
        - they they use the small machine, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        -  These deposits are very small
        - NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater
        - And then in paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on Earth
        -  The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  And then if you look in at then at the next
        - Okay
        - Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so
        -  So what is the question we're trying to answer
        - So let's look back at the text
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look in the text
        -  Do you, can you guys see the text
        -  Okay
        - Let's look at the third paragraph
        -  Does anyone want to read that for me
        -  The second paragraph, under the moon is a desert
        -  So can you read to me, please
        - Okay
        -  Well, you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and all that good stuff
        -  Yeah, read the next sentence
        - Can you read that
        -  According to paragraph two, what does it do, again, what's the second sentence say
        - Um, what do you think it does
        - will you reread the question for me
        - And it can you continue for the next two sentences
        - The scientist, it says that they need a microscope to look closely
        - Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so STUDENT, would you go ahead and read the question to us
        - I want to look back at the question so STUDENT, would you go ahead and read the question for us
        - Okay, well I do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five, so I'd like everybody to look at paragraph five,
        -  So it says the moon
        - To look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work
        -  Water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Water could be useful in other ways
        - Okay, so go ahead and read that last sentence for us
        -  How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it
        - Well, that's fantastic
        -  So, STUDENT, why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us
        - Sure
        - Perfect summary
        -  Thank you so much for summer for us but I loved your summary
        -  And you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used, let's go back and look at paragraph one into
        - but read the question to me one more time
        - So, let's go back up the text has one, two, and three
        -  So in looking at the one, two, and three, they're short little sentences
        - Let's look at number two, the sentence starts with NASA
        - Okay so reread that
        - Okay, so that number two we just read, read
        - And it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small
        - So, reading back through and what STUDENT had just talked about with this small machine
        - But how about
        -  Oh, yes
        -  First, we go back to the question itself
        -  STUDENT
        - Would you be okay to read the final sentence there
        -  Oh, yes, yes
        -  STUDENT
        - What's that say
        - Yeah, the one starts with that the final sentence there
        -  My apologies
        -  Oh
        - Can you look back in the text and see
        - So let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me
        - Can you read paragraph two for me
        - So if you look back, paragraph two, can you read that for me
        -  So I want you to go back and I'd like you to look at paragraph number five
        - Okay, good
        - So we need to look and paragraph number two
        -  It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface
        - In paragraph number two
        -  The first sentence
        - Or the South Pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small
        - So the water they found is microscopic and it says, meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it
        - All right, STUDENT, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one
        - STUDENT saw your hand first
        -  Let's go with you
        - Hi, STUDENT, I saw your hand first
        -  Let's go
        - let's very quickly
        -  I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time
        -  I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        -  So, would you mind STUDENT, would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class, please
        - Yeah, I see, I see
        -  In the last minute
        - Let's look specifically at
        -  Well, I'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself, NASA send a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits
        - These ice deposits for very small sounds
        -  It says that one of the top 10 layers
        -  Okay, good
        -  That was for myself
        -  Thank you guys and that they would contain water
        - How about we look halfway down
        -  Do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton, you see that sentence
        - I'm going to read that for all of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        -  And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water
        - Well, let's look at paragraph three reading
        - Do me a favor, I want you to look at paragraph five,
        - Okay, so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind
        -  Okay
        -  I'm going to read you this paragraph
        -  The water they found is microscopic
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        -  I would use it
        - If you guys have your text handy
        - Okay, so let's take a look at the text
        - So see, let's see if we can look back and find the answer in the story
        - So if we look back in the story
        -  The water they found is microscopic meaning
        -  It wouldn't be able to see
        - under paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on Earth
        - See if you look straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  These deposits are very small
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for us deposits in a large polar crater
        - So paragraph two, says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - That means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth
        -  If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - Why don't we all take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me
        - yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay
        - It says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        -  So water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely
        - all right, can you read that to me please
        - We learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines
        -  NASA, which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon
        - Sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them
        -  And then we found the water, but the water is microscopic
        - I want you to like for everybody else go back and reread because in the small, the first paragraph, is where you got that from
        -  So now we're going to reflect on what STUDENT shared there
        -  Anyone want to read out loud, the first, second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter
        - So that's correct
        -  So I want everyone to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two
        - Alright perfect so i'll give you guys a second, if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely STUDENT
        - So before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them, I want you guys to reread and look at the paragraph four, five and six in your reading once you guys are done, we can look at, we can keep going with this lesson
        - What I want you guys to do is to look at that reading, one more time
        - So on the first text it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within moons create polar craters us craters are dark places that the sun never shines
        - I'll we know NASA has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        -  The water they found is microscopic Microsoft
        - For the third call it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - Microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it
        -  If you were looking straight at it, you need to scientific tool called the Microsoft look very close
        - The discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us
        - Um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us
        - All right
        -  So we, we just read the moon is a desert and I asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Hi, everybody
        - awesome I am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely, if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes, starting now to read
        - So i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you guys can let me know if you're done before that
        - So we have NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - but I want to reread it again I want to show you a sentence, and I think it's a
        - three, paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth, they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - would be a valuable or very important resource, it could be useful in lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is
        - Would you be able to read that last sentence for us, then, as a group
        - Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas
        - why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time, can you read it out loud for me
        - It did so, I want you to read read me the question out loud
        -  These creators are dark places where the sun never shines
        -  So scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters
        - So if we read, question number in the first response
        -  These ice deposits are very small
        - So now reading number two, so NASA send a small machine called lunar over order to investigate this order looks for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - Let's move on to the last one
        -  That means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on Earth
        -  You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2
        - Does anybody want to go back and read over in paragraph 5?
        -  Can everybody go back and read the number Paragraph to where it starts with NASA sent a small, can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph, please
        - But let's kind of read
        -  I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence
        - Can you read the sentence that you found that in
        - Yes, just take a second and reread it
        - Let's look at Paragraph two, where NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        -  Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two
        - So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now
        -  Actually let's start with just paragraph two
        - Yeah, maybe reread it once or twice, just to see, okay,
        -  Okay, now you can start to read the task now
        - Yeah, great
        - Teacher : NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        -  So, STUDENT, or Oliver
        - Teacher : The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        -  If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called or microscope to look really closely
        -  I'm sorry
        - Okay, and STUDENT can you reread that first question?
        - STUDENT
        -  Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer
        -  STUDENT
        - Can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me, please
        - and then STUDENT, can you reread the part about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Um, can you read the next two sentences for me
        - Can someone read reread paragraph two, for me, where it begins with NASA send a small machine, who can read that for me
        -  So can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me
        - but let's read the next step
        - So let's start by looking back at the question again
        - So can someone read the question out loud to me
        -  So the way that I would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text
        - That's a really good question
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Each ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day
        -  Could someone read that out loud to me
        - So why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time
        - So why don't we all work on that together
        -  So could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me STUDENT
        - You were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if I would suggest you revisit the question one more time
        - Can you read what that question is
        - STUDENT, can you read?
        - Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - The second one is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        -  And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth
- intent: r120.2
  examples: |
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes STUDENT
        - So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon

        - Yeah, I'm going to read the question
        -  Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon
        -  What equipment
        -  Did they use to discover that water
        -  All of you can take a look at the question again
        -  It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  If you can take a look at your passage
        - And in your question
        - Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, we've just answered what equipment
        -  Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's right
        -  So let's look at our passage and see what equipment
        -  Did they use to find that
        - Okay, but we're going to what equipment
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So let's look back at our question
        -  It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water
        -  So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water
        - Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right, so STUDENT, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right
        -  But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon
        -  The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon
        -  What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yes
        -  This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - Absolutely
        - But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water

        - because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and
        -  So what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        -  That's right
        - Lunar Orbiter
        - Now let's see is, does anybody want to share why they think water could be valuable?
        - Alright, so we just talked read the article water on the moon
        -  And the question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  But can you find what the what NASA used to investigate the water on the moon?
        - Right
        -  So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?
        - Exactly
        -  But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?
        - Right
        -  They sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment
        - Right
        -  So, and our question said that NASA
        -  Did they sebd to investigate water
        -  Okay
        - Okay, so now what does it say that they sent
        -  What did they send to investigate
        - Our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Because we need to know which
        - Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so
        - So what if I put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was
        - So, question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  That's our question to
        -  Okay
        -  Um, so my question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Okay
        -  Okay, so, um,
        - What equipment do they use to find the water
        -  So while I'm talking to
        - because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that
        - So do you think it would be
        - Important to have water on the moon
        -  Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look at our question
        -  So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Let's start off with rereading the question
        -  Right?

        - So I know I know, so the question said, is there evidence that water can be valuable
        - Okay, so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're going to focus on the question, what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - Who was that STUDENT what is it called
        - For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon
        - So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used STUDENT
        - So yes, they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks, but to discover water on the moon remember what they used
        - know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable
        - Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?
        - We're just trying to help
        -  STUDENT remember what the lunar orbiter was
        - Yeah, so you know what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  Oh yeah, STUDENT
        - because the question was what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you guys had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  STUDENT's answer was, NASA sent a small machine
        - So what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon
        - So we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon
        -  Um so first, I just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick
        - Awesome, thank you STUDENT
        - Just so I can make sure that everybody knows what the question is um So the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's great
        -  So after you guys read the article, we have the question to talk about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon
        - Okay, so now moving on to the second question, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon, excuse me, could be valuable
        - considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So you guys just answered what object did-- I'm so sorry
        - My name is Teacher 
        -  What equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon, right? OK
        -  We're going to talk about that STUDENT what's your question
        - Before even before I answer your question
        -  I'm just gonna review what we're going to go over
        -  So we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So let's look back at the question we're going to answer
        -  Great question
        -  And I think that might help answer your question, STUDENT
        - Sure
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So do you have anything to share about including evidence?
        -  We are talking about including evidence to support our answers
        - Oh
        -  Thank you, STUDENT
        -  Right now we are not talking about space
        - So now, we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer
        -  So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with STUDENT oh Luis you have a question
        - What that means is the question was what equipment, we used to find the water on the space on the moon, and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water
        - The question that's being asked
        -  So the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Right, so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon
        - question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but the question was asking what equipment
        - but then the question is, is there any evidence that water can be valuable
        - Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - But I want us
        -  And the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon,
        -  But the goal
        - was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Now your answer, yes STUDENT
        - I just wanted to clarify what the question was, so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the, on the moon could be valuable
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover?
        - So let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look, all together, we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter
        - Because it's microscopic awesome STUDENT
        - Okay, so, STUDENT, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  So the first question as a group is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - So let's look over our initial questions
        - So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - OK
        -  And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does anybody have any thoughts on that?
        -  So we're going to discuss the next question
        - Oh, good
        -  The evidence in the text, so that we can answer the question
        -  So I just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  And then we had a circle
        -  Okay, so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - No, we're good
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,
        -  So we're going to look at the second question, and the question just to reiterate, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Awesome
        - All together, we're going to go back to the question
        - And almost all of you, I'm going to ask you to really re examine the questions That you're asked about what equipment to the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That is also a really good point so let's go back to our prompt and want everyone to look at and see what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so it says we're entering question
        -  Okay
        -  One question one is about the equipment
        - What else do people think is water valuable why or why not
        - The question is, what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon
        - But let's look at a question
        -  Again, the question is asked, What equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon
        - Teacher : So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon
        -  Yes
        - You as well
        -  STUDENT Do you have a question
        -  So our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  And I'm going to give you a minute to do this is I want you to reread the question
        -  So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so my first task that I would like you to do
        -  It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if we look back at that question
        -  So let's reread the question
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so our question is,
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Oh
        -  Does someone want to
        - So you guys answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  STUDENT You have your hand raised
        -  You have a question
        - Do you want to go first then STUDENT about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Talk about what they said
        -  For when they answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon
        -  I want you to be thinking about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover
        - And while you're listening
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So the first fact is that
        - So the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - For everybody so feel free to answer
        -  And the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text
        - Wow, I'm sure you know a lot of space
        -  But let's go over what our discussion question was, and that question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  I see that you guys have just answered your question your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon
        -  STUDENT
        - Good, thank you
        -  Yes
        - Let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon
        - Good
        -  Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  And you said, NASA sent a small machine
        -  So now if we look at your answer to our question
        - I'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find
        - So I saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so can we look back in the text
        -  STUDENT
        - the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  Yes
- intent: r530.1
  examples: |
        - Great job everyone, so how has your thinking changed, I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity
        - alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation
        -  STUDENT So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning
        - Exactly
        -  What's another way you might answer that question
        -  So can you see, um, you know, how we can approach that question a little differently now that you've kind of looked at it
        - Yes, yes
        -  How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking
        -  Can you go back to that
        - About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking
        -  Were you thinking about that a little differently
        -  So what made you what, how did I change your answer
        -  That's great
        - That's great
        - Okay, so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer
        -  So how did you go about correcting your answer
        -  Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be
        -  Now that we've discussed it
        -  So what kind of helped us find our answer
        - Yeah
        - So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your think
        - How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently
        - OK, so now that I have given you guys some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking
        -   Then, how that changed
        -  So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did
        - Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer
        -  Can you help me figure out the why
        - So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning
        - So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change
        - STUDENT, has that change your thinking a little bit?
        - Alright so let's all think what did we learn about changing our answers today?
        - Do you see any ways does your mind kind of changing
        -  Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your group
        - Alright
        -  So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response
        -  And now I think this way because And then you can tell me
        -  So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what
        - Okay
        -  So, reflect on that process what that was like
        -  You started out thinking a certain way and now you think
        - Yo, yo
        - So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process
        -  I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank
        -  So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now
        - Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you
        - Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer
        -  But now what they know is the right answer
        -  Does anyone else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
        - Great
        - Does anyone else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
        - Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers
        - Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so STUDENT what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have
        - Okay STUDENT, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change
        - yeah so I want you guys to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future
        - So I would love to hear from STUDENT Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you guys just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can
        - Alright cool STUDENT so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response, a little bit more specific to what you read today
        - awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas
        - Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer what was different about those two
        - Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?
        - STUDENT
        -  what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
        - mm hmm so let's just think about as a team like What did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? STUDENT
        - So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
        - OK so STUDENT do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking
        - Great so STUDENT now that you're participating already Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response
        - is there anything else did anyone do anything different when they were revising their answer
        - First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions
        - yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that
        - And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
        - mm hmm and has your thinking changed at all about how they found it
        - Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think
        - What was different about your first answer and your second you said
        - So how can I ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer what was what was different and how other than just writing more, what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer
        - How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think
        - Thank you okay so STUDENT do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions
        -  Whatever you think it's Okay, if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you all are thinking so take a moment before our conversation I thought this after our conversation I thought this
        - Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, but just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think
        - has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this STUDENT sorry I saw your hand was up
- intent: r410.2
  examples: |
        - Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be
        - but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right
        -  You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely
        - So STUDENT with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great
        -  But when you tell me about the tool
        -  What are we trying to do to the water, guys
        - So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water
        -  So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water
        - Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer
        -  What small machine? What was it called?
        - You could have been looking at her paper
        -  You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does
        - okay and in your answer
        -  Does your answer tell what discovered the water?
        - but it's not quite the only thing that they used
        -  You're right
        -  There are a piece of equipment that they used
        -  And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool
        - So scientists do use those type of things
        - Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific
        -  So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer
        - I asked STUDENT over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text
        -  It's answering a different question
        - But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us
        -  So even though your answer is true
        - Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific
        - And that is very, very true, but it's not exactly phrased in the way that answers the question
        - Thinking back on what I just told STUDENT, does it answer the question that we are asking
        - Well, just because you need to have a deeper understanding doesn't mean your answers wrong just that you could probably put in a little more detail in your answer
        - And that's a it's an equipment, isn't it, but we look in the passage for a specific small machine and it tells us in the passage that there is a it gives us the name of the small machine
        -  But it's not the specific machine
        - And STUDENT That you put scientists found is using a small machine so that small machine is correct that small machine could be any sort of tool
        - So all those facts are right that you guys had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay
        - So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you STUDENT, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to Farrah, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and
        -  So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?
        - So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity
        -  If we were more, a little more specific, I should say
        - But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding
        -  So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically
        -  And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at
        - but it's still wrong
        -  We want to know about this equipment
        - The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but
        - If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space
        -  They absolutely do
        - Yes, yes, they do
        -  But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story
        - So we got to make sure that when we're answering
        -  We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were
        -  And that is really close to what we're looking for here
        -  So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine
        -  So, good job
        - Yes, so NASA did send a small machine
        -  In this case, STUDENT was a little too vague
        - Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for
        -  This is how you go about doing it
        -  We're talking about NASA specifically right
        - We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon
        -  We're talking about someone that's already done
        - But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific
        - but can I ask you another question about that
        -  So is that convincing me that water would be valuable?
        - Okay, so that is true
        -  That is something that we read in the story, but does it answer the questions about what they used
        -  Let's see
        - That's true, but we want to focus on the text
        - I think we just need some more to it
        -  But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - Wow, that's very possible and STUDENT, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy
        -  That is true
        - So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting guys to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water
        -  Does that make sense
        -  But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too
        - You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon
        -  Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space
        -  I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water
        -  I don't think the intention is for it to discover water
        - The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts
        -  It's just a little bit incomplete
        - So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me
        -  It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent
        - So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete
        - Because some of us are, you know, technically correct, but not not super correct like STUDENT over there said oxygen tanks
        -  Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to The moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water
        -  We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine
        - And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true
        -  It's a little bit more detailed than STUDENT's
        -  And could you discover water with that specific tool
        -  Could you go into space
        - I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now
        -  So my suggestion to all of you would be to maybe
        - So, back to you
        -  Svannah and STUDENT the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water
        - I think
        -  I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific
        -  But I do think water is valuable
        -  Nancy STUDENT
        -  Yes
        - So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment
        -  Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that
        - But you focus on the article
        -  But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon
        - Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that
        -  It's really cool
        - They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable
        - So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with STUDENT, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it
        -  Right
        -  So when we look at our key words and then our key words there in the passage
        -  We know that it's got to be more than just that
        - Right, we would think that, but when we look at our key words from the text we got to remember, it's telling us the answers in the text
        -  And we got to look for the specific answer
        - lets people know what you're talking about
        -  Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter
        -  We're not going to which question
        -  It goes to
        - Master breathe with and they use different equipment for different task, but we needed to know specifically what they used to discover the Water Rat
        - Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter
        -  They're not going to what we're talking about
        -  What if we put
        - Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text
        -  It didn't talk about that
        -  So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is
        -  Does that make sense
        - And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters
        - Yes, you need to be just a little more descriptive in your response
        -  But once you add that little extra bit of adding the official name of what equipment was used, then you're going to be on the right track
        - but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that
        - answers the question better
        - but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely
        -  It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it
        -  I think you need to add a little bit more
        - So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph
        - When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things
        -  Does that make sense
        -  So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story
        -  Does that make a little bit more sense
        -  So their ships wouldn't have to carry it
        -  Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it
        -  So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon
        - So is it heavy
        - Uh, your answer is technically correct
        -  The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter
        - Okay, STUDENT you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery
        -  Right
        -  You just picked the wrong one
        -  We're not talking about space, though
        -  So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that
        - Well that's good that you know a lot about space
        -  Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text
        -  While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster
        -  We want to see what they say
        -  So we want
        - Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine
        - But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon
        -  Do you understand that
        -  So let's look at the question again
        -  So your answer doesn't really relate to that question
        - But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes
        -  I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        -  But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that
        - So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space
        - So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics
        - Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?
        - oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you
        -  STUDENT So it does talk about oxygen
        - No, you're right
        -  But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment
        -  So we know that one doesn't answer a question
        - Correct
        -  So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water
        -  But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen
        -  But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool
        -  That is correct
        -  This scientist used to discover water on the moon
        -  That is a tool that they use
        - Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yes, it should be a good answer there
        -  But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out
        -  Okay
        - Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on
        - But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out
        - I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water
        - It doesn't have enough water, but it hasn't not enough of something else that we have to have do me a favor
        -  STUDENT?
        -  So, you missed one part of that because it works as a group
        -  Okay, Mr
        - Yes
        - They don't really say that, is where Mr
        -  STUDENT talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts
        -  It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks, do they do use them
        -  STUDENT?
        -  Yes, but not in this text
        -  Mr
        - You just needed the name of the item that they used
        - um I it's not wrong it's just you can add a little bit you can add more to it and have it be a more complete dot not that isn't like a complete thought, but like
        - But yeah i'm so STUDENT had a good answer it could have been longer but
        - Your answer is not wrong but it's not correct, you said yes, they use a small machine and the Lunar orbit is a machine, but it was not as specific as I would have wanted to hear
        - Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it
        - I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope
        - And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,
        - And, as I talked, as I said, to STUDENT she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah
        - One part you were missing, though, is
        -  So what were they looking at closely
        - What they were looking at
        -  I really want to hear
        - So I didn't
        -  I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as STUDENT
        - So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that STUDENT circle, the same one as you
        - But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know
        - But I want to hear more specific answers in that
        -  What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like
        - I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading
        -  Right?
        - STUDENT, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words,
        - I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as STUDENT
        - I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators so did you go and highlight two types of equipment
        - And STUDENT had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth, I want to know what Oliver found in the reading I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great
        - So your answer is right, but you will have -didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name
        - I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in class but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say
        -  But I think what I was looking for is a little bit more information on
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA send a small machine which is completely correct
        - So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards
        - When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text
        - And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question
        - That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and STUDENT were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship
        - Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the
        - Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was
        - Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used
        - But we need to highlight the equipment
        - and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it 
        - Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of
        - whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could
        -  One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question
        -  So
        -  And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one
        - That is a really good answer
        -  So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to all of our answers to make them a little bit stronger
        - but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see
        - But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?
        - That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because
        - And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving STUDENT um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question right like how Is that why water is valuable why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why
        - Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question
        - I just wanted to see where you found it
        -  I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the class knows where to look
        - AND then STUDENT
        -  so your response says that they found craters full of water
        -  But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters
        -  When I heard your response
        -  You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine
        -  You were a little vague
        - Now, STUDENT
        -  You just stated evidence
        - Okay, so STUDENT your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence
        - Because your answer could have gone either way
        - You could have said no
        - Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume
        - just like STUDENT he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree
        -  That's great
        -  And then so STUDENT, you said you circled the same as Farrah, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer
        - Perfect
        -  Perfect
        - In your answer it's very vague, so it just says a small machine
        - But I was hoping that maybe we could work on adding a little bit more detail to your writing because someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is right
        -  Right
        -  But what has already been discovered on the moon
        -  I'm concerned about your tense because you kind of address, you said you need a scientific tool
        -  So when I was reading that I thought you were talking to me
        - I'm a little bit concerned STUDENT
        -  It didn't really restate the question
        - I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer
        -  STUDENT
        -  So the way that you worded your answer
        -  You just said I circled the same as savannas I it doesn't help me know if you understand the question, or the answer really um
        - I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything
        - So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail
        - But what made you say that, my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        -  And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        - Yes
        - But you need a little more specific
        -  Okay
        - Teacher : Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon
        - Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term
        -  So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks
        - Teacher : But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks
        -  Our question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Small machine
        -  My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine
        - Right, so you have the answer
        - It was more that we just need to build more on it
        -  So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step
        - Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic
        - However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text
        -  Does that make sense to you?
        - If you provided that information that you just told me, STUDENT, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question
        -  However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer
        - And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used
        - When we provide information from our own background knowledge
        -  The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information
        - So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response
        -  And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right
        - but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules
        - The person who's reading your response
        -  Don't know where you got that information right
        -  You may question where you got that evidence
        -  So if he was reading your response
        -  However, maybe STUDENT doesn't know that
        -  And if it's truly valid right
        - For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it
        - Absolutely
        -  But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water
        -  If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen
        -  That is correct
        - Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details
        - But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so STUDENT
        -  That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this
        -  I really appreciate that point and you are correct
        -  So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed
        - But there weren't any astronauts present
        - But the focus
        -  Question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and we need to answer that question using the article
        -  There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer
        - STUDENT your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence
        - So you identify why water is valuable
        -  But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon
        - So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be
        - I'm concerned that that we need to find something a little bit more specific
        -  And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for
        -  STUDENT So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Yes, a new answer
        -  So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail
        - Another the main equipment
        -  Okay
        - I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer
        - What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you guys found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think
        - but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take
        - yeah that's absolutely right, I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any
        - i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story
        - yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question
        - but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story
        - i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your
        - So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks
        -  But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text
        - And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence
        - Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading
        - I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here
        - You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine
        - You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK
        - But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so
        - But we wanted to use the text
        - They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text
        - At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample
        - i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts
        - But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery
        - In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon
        - because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component
        - If somehow you looked at STUDENT the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space
        - You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right
        - We look at the text that you have we want to see what equipment they talked about from the article so that may be true, on space exploration, that we do need
        - yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though
        - That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right
        - But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?
        - However, there was another machine you guys that they also used
        - Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every all your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help
        - mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself
        - Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah STUDENT
        - So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question
        - So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question
        - Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly
        - i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today
        - well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so
        - And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts
        - and i'm concerned that the responses that you guys chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon
        - All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking
        - I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess
        - But the question here is based on the text that we just read
        - So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time
        - Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small
        - But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but
        - But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was
        - So you STUDENT took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article
- intent: r430.2
  examples: |
        - Absolutely, and you are, you are, you are correct and, but when we're asking you in this question is to circle, the evidence, so we want you to draw your answer from something specifically that you read here
        - STUDENT was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use
        - But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that
        - so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words
        - so STUDENT and Oliver both circled microscope
        -  that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely
        -  STUDENT, you have a question
        - so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover
        -  I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter M, if that's helpful
        -  You can look back in your reading for that
        -  I would love if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is
        - And STUDENT NASA send out a small machine
        - Well, they used a lunar orbiter
        -  But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for
        -  So a little more in depth
        -  They did send a small machine, right, that is, but it was asking specifically
        - So your answer
        -  So could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment
        -  What that piece of equipment's name was?
        -  But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about
        -  That's very good
        -  So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct
        - That's very good
        -  So in the article
        - Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there
        -  Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water
        - Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment
        -  I think that we could even
        -  So this is kind of for all of us here
        - Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters
        -  I think he would be on a great, great track
        - And STUDENT might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there
        -  If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question
        - So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that
        -  You can use this to do that
        -  Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well
        -  Why don't we change the subject
        - Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water
        -  We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water
        -  So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close
        -  Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a
        - So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine
        -  I need to dig a little deeper
        -  And what else does the passage
        -  So with your answer
        -  Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable
        - Good
        -  What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen
        -  Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT
        -  So you want to say yes it's valuable because of all the things that you were saying
        - You guys are all close but you want to get an exact answer
        -  So you want to expand your answer a little bit
        -  So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage
        - It was a small machine, STUDENT
        - I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down
        -  And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down
        -  So that's the only thing I would add to your answer
        - and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used
        - Make sure you back things up, it takes like STUDENT Farrah, you know, like in your answer
        -  You didn't really back it up
        -  I want you to read that last paragraph for me, STUDENT
        -  Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read
        - They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon
        - Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking
        - So, STUDENT and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track
        -  But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer
        -  Does that make sense
        - You, you just said I circled the same as STUDENT, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did
        -  So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But there's, it's more descriptive
        -  But what was the machine called and what did it do?
        -  And you're right, it is a small machine
        -  They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine
        -  So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        -  You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific
        - It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it
        -  I like that you
        -  To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you
        -  So can you come up with a new way
        - However, if we were talking just about our reading passage
        -  Those are not necessarily in there
        -  It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer
        -  A STUDENT, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote
        -  Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's
        -  So next time
        -  OK?
        - Okay, so next time
        -  Does that make sense
        -  You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water
        - In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question
        -  Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was was the name of that small machine small machine
        - but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific
        -  That is an excellent point
        - Why would that be useful
        -  So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence
        -  So what is that next sentence say
        -  But I want you to think about why that would be useful
        -  Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And STUDENT What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen
        -  So instead, let's focus on your opinion
        -  So is there
        -  So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon
        -  So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific
        - So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question
        -  You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid
        - What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine
        -  We need to make that answer specific
        -  So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  Yes
        -  Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question
        - Yes
        - So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        -  : Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable
        -  But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question
        -  So all you have right now is evidence
        - And then you explain that evidence
        -  What was the name of the small machine that was used
        - And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you
        -  Okay
        -  So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer
        -  What was your answer to that question
        - In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so STUDENT
        -  Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself
        -  Is it wrong
        -  What was that small machine used for
        - Well, your, your answer
        -  I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used
        - You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own
        -  You just said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        -  So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in STUDENT's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it
        - Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon
        - Um, well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying, NASA send a small machine, but, um, you could have talked about what that machine was and how it But, um, yeah
        -  So you weren't you weren't wrong
        -  Oh, it's just, I'm a little too broad
        - um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks, you can maybe mentioned, like the soup thing where because that's also equipment, because they needed to be up there on
        - But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote
        -  So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly
        - it's a wide range for an answer, so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay
        - was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra
        -  You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA
        - You did
        -  You said I remember your response
        -  We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text
        -  But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific
        -  Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you
        -  I still want you to say an answer, because I want everybody to be giving an answer
        - And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer
        - Tool a microscope to look really closely
        -  That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific
        -  You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon
        - you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water, I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer
        - but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail
        -  So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information
        - To the moon
        -  So, that's correct
        -  But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon
        - So you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon, but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response, you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like STUDENT and Jazmin added
        - However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that
        - My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and
        - so with  your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it
        -  So we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text
        -  Instead, your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading
        - but I would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text
        -  Like for example, we know that NASA used the Rover to find water on the moon
        -  Maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer
        -  And we want to go a little bit further, we want to dig a little bit deeper
        - But we want to explore a little bit further
        -  Ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read, could they learn that information from your answer
        - Your answer isn't wrong STUDENT
        -  I want you to expand your answer
        -  I want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine
        -  Is that OK with you
        -  Right
        -  So I want you to find your answer in the text because I want us to practice that skill
        -  But I do want us to practice being that reading detective
        - Totally and and that's very helpful
        -  Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer
        -  I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence
        - It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer
        -  And why can you tell me if this is good or bad, and why
        - I'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing
        - But my concern is, would you look carefully at the passage I think you have targeted the right place in the passage
        -  You just need to be a little more specific
        -  You want to use the text for our answers
        - We don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable
        - yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too, so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals
        - The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine
        - In this way, that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so
        - Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and
        - but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?
        - i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question
        - Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water
        - To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used
        - Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use
        - Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again
        - Yes, oh, you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions
        - So what i'm noticing in STUDENT's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon
        - But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used
        - but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think
        - To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question
        - so STUDENT is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture
        - So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick
        - I am wondering if we could get more specific STUDENT right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this
        - And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay
        - You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text
        - So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be
        - STUDENT I loved your answer
        - well
        - Absolutely STUDENT um
        - I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is
- intent: r510.1
  examples: |
        - so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence
        - Absolutely that's great that is a great definition of what evidence is right when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question
        - so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use
        - All right, um STUDENT, can you explain to me what evidence is
        - But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us
        - Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers
        -  We just needed to look more closely at our text
        - So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were all really close
        -  Yes
        -  It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for
        -  STUDENT
        - Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question
        - It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say
        - So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question
        -  More flow through this
        - The first time you scan it right
        -  You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah
        -  Does that make sense
        - And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again
        -  So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question
        -  Right
        - But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking
        - Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer
        -  Thank
        - You the strategy I talked about
        -  Right
        - Say, practice makes perfect
        -  So if you want to be good at something, you keep john over and over and over
        -  We found a key what
        - So remember when we looked at our question
        - You remember what I asked you to find
        - Keyword to help us and to answer the question
        -  Did we need to answer this question
        -  And what key word
        -  It is so important
        - So always find and identify a keyword
        -  So you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text
        -  She used the passage that we provided to find her answer
        -  I like how STUDENT was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and Luis that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond
        - That's very good
        -  Again, I like how she's very specific
        -  She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text
        - Yes, so we look really closely at those key words in our question
        -  Okay
        - So remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text
        - So remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words
        - And then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer
        -  It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next
        - Yeah
        -  So often when we read it will tell us a sequence
        -  So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
        - Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence
        - Well, what I do agree
        -  What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something
        -  STUDENT?
        - When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on
        -  So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name
        - Okay
        -  So I think we've all kind of like learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
        - Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT?
        -  We know we all know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given
        - Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper
        -  So we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words
        - Mm hmm
        -  Yeah
        -  Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question
        -  Who thinks that they they can explain to STUDENT What what keywords
        - Alright, so let's look back at our question
        - But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings
        -  So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer
        - Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence
        -  And then what happened
        - Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text
        -  You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question
        -  So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened
        -  And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was
        -  I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific
        -  So we went
        -  So, so you built off your answer
        - Yes
        -  Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct
        -  We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for
        -  And this is what it was doing
        -  And much like with STUDENT earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question
        - Okay, again, so
        -  And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components
        - That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together
        -  And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
        -  So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
        - So I really like to do is the race format
        -  What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        -  I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking
        - So for example, when I read
        - So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank
        -  And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment
        -  Where are we using yes STUDENT
        - But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific,
        -  So you can be give the best answer
        - So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords
        - See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
        - Yes, that is exactly what I would like
        -  And that goes for everyone, not just STUDENT
        -  So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading
        - great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer
        - What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question
        - Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water
        -  So that was a really great response
        -  So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well
        - Great
        -  You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why
        -  What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using
        -  Yes STUDENT
        - There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before
        -  So a lunar orbiter a microscope
        - yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions
        -  Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning
        -  That was a perfect or smart
        -  Good job
        - Really Alice
        -  It was very specific
        - So to find evidence
        -  And she said, paragraph three, so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading
        -  STUDENT quoted
        -  We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that
        - And in our responses we want to use academic language
        -  It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers to use
        - I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you
        -  It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning
        - and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water
        - STUDENT, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking
        - You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable
        - If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay
        -  So STUDENT, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer
        - Great
        - So when we're answering comprehension questions like this
        -  We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information
        - I am going to give you some sentence starters and
        - This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies
        - So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question
        - So STUDENT, and then you when you change your answer to what Jazmin also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        - She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon
        - Can You Do you remember
        -  Can you restate what their strategy is
        - So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer
        -  And you were able to find another part that you could add to it
        - Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing
        - and I think that that's an excellent strategy for anyone to think about when we're reading a text is to think
        - yeah STUDENT it's great all right i'm so glad that you have so much background
        - When you're trying to answer this question is just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph and then find us as they're seeing the paragraph here just located
        - When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
        -  So that's a great process
        - So that's great that's a great segue
        -  So what I wanted to ask you guys, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically
        - So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important STUDENT, you have something to add
        - are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question STUDENT, what do you think
        - I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text so i'm
        - And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components
        - Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two
        - What i'm going to suggest to all of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
        - so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading
        - That can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it
        -  We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers
        -  All right, who's ready to start
        - yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists
        - Did anyone else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers
        - okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely
        - So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so
        - I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique
        - that's good yeah the thing about the thing about reading for keywords and sometimes authors will use synonyms so two words that mean the same thing, so when we're thinking about discovery definitely found or
        - yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
        - yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with STUDENT I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response
        - I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go
        - Fantastic so I really appreciate coming STUDENT just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here
        - The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response
        - I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text
        - so I think STUDENT you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two
        - yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy, you can use in response questions
        - Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so
        - But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text,
- intent: r410.1
  examples: |
        - But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - Absolutely and that's something that like STUDENT put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us
        - Also, STUDENT, your question or your answer
        -  Had to do with equipment as well
        -  But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main
        -  It was the Lunar Orbiter
        -  But that's not what the, um, that's not what
        - They do
        -  The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon
        - But I think you may be confused on the question,
        -  Right
        - And the question I think we need to be a little more specific
        - And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking
        -  But the question is actually specifically pointing toward
        - Right
        -  And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it
        -  What's the potential value
        - They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space
        -  So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space
        - but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water
        - I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money
        -  The question was, is water valueable
        -  But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment
        -  I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we all had
        - Because he answered, whether it was a good investment
        - Stop right there
        -  So although you're, you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely, what it equip-- They're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it
        -  But did they discover the water with the microscope?
        - So they use the microscope, microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water
        - but is the question asking is it right now
        - but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable
        -  Not that they're ready
        -  Would it be valuable to
        -  But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically
        -  So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together
        - Yes, very good
        -  What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment
        - But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so
        -  And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that
        -  It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water
        - A little bit
        -  But for this specific question
        - However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense
        - Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope
        -  That's very good
        -  It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        -  But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking,
        - That's right
        - Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So when we look at yours, you don't necessarily answer the question i can i can tell what you're getting at by reading your evidence, but you don't actually specifically answer the question then provide evidence and then just explain it
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon
        -  That's what the question was asked
        - It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples
        - If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar
        -  Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up
        - Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect
        -  You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question
        - That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used
        - we're talking about the equipment, so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment
        - yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked
        - Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water
        - But you didn't talk about the equipment
        - The question asked for you to talk about the equipment
        -  This is for everybody, not just STUDENT, when you are talking about
        -  So when you guys are
        - So you guys are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated
        - STUDENT you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking
        - So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking
        - Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so
        - Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear
        -  We're looking at when they used to find the water
        - Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one, so, while they do use those equipment, that's not what we're looking for for this question
        - So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon
        - What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so
        - Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked
        - which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon
        - But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry
        - But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is
        - But, that doesn't truly answer the question
        - Alright STUDENT, so, when we look back at the question
        -  While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        -  Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?
        -  It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that
        - So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,
        - That is true and it's basically just what I told STUDENT, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water
        - but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines
        - To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water
        - but do you think that that's answering the question
        - What
        - part of the question do you think you're missing
        -  Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question
        -  Do you understand?
        - So your - STUDENT, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found
        - but in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water
        - And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon
        - Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use
        - But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-- is that a type of equipment?
        - The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically
        - We kind of need both
        -  So although I really love your answer
        -  And it did teach me something I do want you to answer the question
        - Yes, the water is an overload along a passage
        -  The key words like equipment do agree
        -  But my concern is other students and they circle
        - You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future
        -  This is the next step after they discovered water for the morn, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one
        - However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly
        -  The main question
        - So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        -  So I'm going to give you guys 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it
        -  And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question
        -  And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer
        - So I want to ask all of you guys take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think: What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question
        -  Can you tell me that
        -  So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for
        -  Are you able to tell me what the question is
        - But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text
        - Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us
        - The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts,
        - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon, so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using STUDENT, did you have a follow up about that
        - But another really important part of his question is the action
        - Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking
        - So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon
        - Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then STUDENT for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right
        - So they can be types of tools, yes, you know equipment gear all those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right
        - And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found
        - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it
        - I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water
- intent: r430.1

        - so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water
        - So in the text, you should be focusing on what would answer that specific question not not pre knowledge
        - So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water
        - You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question
        -  So another suggestion is, once you have
        -  And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon
        -  They are using the microscope to look at the water
        - That is true
        -  However, I like how STUDENT really looked at the question
        - That's a good place to start
        -  So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question
        -  Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions
        -  What did they use to see the water
        -  Okay
        -  You did say a fair point
        - So you didn't quite answer the question there
        -  So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use
        -  Did they use
        -  What type of equipment
        -  What type of machines
        -  But the question really was
        -  And you've told me where on the moon
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  Right
        -  The water was discovered
        -  So what can you add to your thoughts to just make it a little bit stronger
        - Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment
        -  Please read the question again do you have another key words like the action in the words in a sentence action word?
        -  So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is
        - All right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly, it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically
        - To what the scientists use
        - So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once
        - What was the equipment that they use to find the water, so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water
        - The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time STUDENT what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements
        - My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment
        - Can you read locate the text and find the STUDENTice that leads you lead the scientists to the water, I think that would make more sense with this particular question, but I think you did
- intent: r420.1
  examples: |
        - All right guys I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question
        -  Yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it
        - Yes, I can
        -  I want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and I want you to find the most important word or the key word that you think is most important in this question
        - In the question what which which which most important word
        -  Did you pick out in the question
        - A microscope is equipment
        -  Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word
        - So right now, everybody to find action word and underline
        -  That is a synonym for investigate
        -  So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question
        -  That's good
        - Find would be the same
        -  Okay
        - So when we're answering questions we need to make sure we're answering the question that's being asked
        -  Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see
        - Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that
        -  If you look at what it should be
        - But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you
        -  Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer
        - What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer
        -  So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question
        - So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question
        - So again, let's look back at our question and look for two key words that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage
        -  Yes, yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question
        - So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to STUDENT
        -  I want you guys to look at question number one
        - OK
        -  OK, so what I want us to do is just a minute
        -  Okay
        - I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth
        - but I want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two key words that are important, that might help you answer the question
        - So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other
        - What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is
        - Saying what specifically
        -  Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for
        -  Once you reread that question
        - That's right
        -  So, but let's look at the question again
        -  So you get that information
        - As you're reading the test
        -  You're the question is trying to answer so SCAM, IT LOOK AT THE QUESTION
        -  And then read to answer the question
        -  So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence, I want you to go back and think deeper about the question
        - What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word
        - Okay, so what words, did we find in our text that helped us answer our question
        - There any words that we circled or underlined in our text
        -  Is that I would read the questions first
        - Yeah
        -  Then I'd read the passage
        -  So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions
        - but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering
        - Yes
        -  And let's think about what key words
        -  Do you hear when you are reading that question
        -  So think about that on your own real quick and then we will discuss what keywords, we see
        -  So let's think about that question together real quick
        -  Okay
        -  Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important
        - There's two words that are very important in this question
        - Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that
        -  When you've circled your two key words
        - If you will just look up at me when you're finished
        -  What do you think
        -  Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words
        - That's all right
        - 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words
        -  So let's
        -  What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover
        -  Looks like we're finished
        - Right
        -  Um, so what do you guys think what is another word for equipment
        -  Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so
        - We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it
        - What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question
        -  The two main action words
        - Or verbs in this question
        -  So I'll give you about
        - 10 seconds
        -  And I want you to take your pencil and just circle
        -  The two action words in the question
        - All right, so what I think we should do, after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question
        - That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text
        -  So if y'all looked at that question
        -  The first question I answered a
        -  Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question
        -  What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question
        - Okay
        -  So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session
        - So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes
        -  Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you
        - Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure
        -  So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute, take some time and look back that question and circle that okay
        -  This is confusing to me
        -  Miss Teacher what about this word
        -  What's to that to you about that question, something about it
        - Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about
        -  First, I want you to look about that question
        - Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that STUDENT used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that
        -  And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions
        - So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of STUDENTs and savannas answers
        - Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text
        -  So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay
        - Okay
        -  Is there anyone here because I want to make sure we understand the question
        -  One question I want to ask, is there anyone here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means
        -  STUDENT, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question
        -  All right
        -  All right, is there anything we have here, right
        -  There are some words that you weren't sure about
        -  Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one
        - We need water to survive
        -  So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you
        - Okay, well I'm very glad to hear
        -  now STUDENT, what's your question?
        -  But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give
        - By throwing in a little something that could be the answer
        - But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question
        - It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers
        -  Does that make sense
        -  We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response
        - But let's look back at the question that was proposed
        -  So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer
        -  Would anybody like to reread that for me
        -  Thank you
        -  So does anybody have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for
        - Okay, great
        - At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question
        - Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words
        - Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to
        -  I think you'll be able to better
        -  You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense
        -  And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely
        - plug it back in
        -  Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question
        - and looking for the keywords in your question as well
        - And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question
        -  That way we can answer the question
        -  You guys are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text
        - But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one
        -  So take just a second
        -  What were the key words
        -  But what were, what was the keywords in number one
        - And your answer is closer to a correct answer
        - And I want you guys to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key
        - Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question
        -  So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question
        - But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how
        -  So what keywords help us answer this question
        - About what words, can we underline in that question to help us answer the question
        -  So just for a second here
        -  Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it
        - What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence
        - So if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points of circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer
        - I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right
        -  I have a timer going right now
        -  All right
        -  I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that
        - yeah so STUDENT and Farrah that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response, so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that
        - you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future
        - But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely
        - So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text
        - when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer all parts of the question and that you're specific as possible
        - so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need
        - now before you share the answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled
        -  Can everyone do that?
        -  I want to do that for one minute and then come back
        - So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important
        - My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used
        - yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment
        - What I suggest, what you guys do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for
        - So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner
        - And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question
        - Where Am I find these words and the passage alright, so you have two minutes, with your partners
        -  You two can start working on your second answer
        - When you go back, I want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves, what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text
        -  It's looking for
        -  Very good
        -  Go back to the question and reread it, please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note Of what kind of answer
        - STUDENT, you identified the main idea of this passage
        -  So I want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment, the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question
        - And STUDENT again
        -  I did you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject
        -  Yeah
        - Identify what kind of answer the question is asking for
        -  See if or reviewed your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text
        -  Okay
        -  It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do
        - And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion
        -  OK, so now please look at the question again, you are going to find out to look keywords all the most important words in a question before you answer it
        - Yeah
        -  So I think you guys understand what I'm saying
        -  Thank you for your response
        -  I saw STUDENT and Oliver not nodding their head
        -  Okay
        -  Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question
        - Okay, great
        - Please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the keywords all the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important in a question, the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - And I want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important
        -  I'll give you a minute to do that
        - That's right
        -  Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for
        -  Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question
        - Can you tell me what they want you to understand
        - So we want to make sure to understand the whole question
        -  So we understand what they're asking us
        -  And so just like I mentioned to STUDENT and Jazmin is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question
        -  Good
        - Yes
        - I think that's a great point, though, STUDENT is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us
        - So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence, who can give me the action word
        - So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question
        - But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, STUDENT
        -  And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking
        - I would like for you guys to think about that question
        - So What words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question
        -  So when you know what's being asked of you, you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer
        - Is very important to know what is being asked
        -  So going back to the question
        - Yes, once again, that's also very important
        -  But when we answer questions we need to make sure we answer on what's being asked of us
        -  And that's good information
        - But before we start to answer this question, I would like to dissect it with you guys and figure out what are they asking us what is it that we need to look for an order to answer the question, you can
        - I would like for us to break down the question and figure out what are they act in us, because once we figure out what's what their accent us we can figure out How to answer the question in what's the answer the question with Oh is it convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence
        -  Evidence is important and what's another important piece of this sentence, and upon part of the sentence that we need in order to answer the question specifically
        -  So you said evidence
        - Thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - And I'm looking for one more piece of the sentence
        -  One more piece of the question
        -  What are some strategies that we can practice before we even answer the question, what are some strategies that we can practice to make sure we are answering the question that's being asked
        - Thank you
        -  So when reading the question, what are some
        -  STUDENT for helping him out
        -  And why should we look at the most important parts, someone can raise their hand or STUDENT
        - Yes
        -  STUDENT for answering
        -  When answering the question we want to look at important words they manage, do you have something else to say
        -  That is very true
        - Yes, thank you
        - But in another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the key words in our question so i'd like all five of you actually to
        - and i'd like you to circle, the key words in our question our action words, the most important words in our texts in our question here, and once you have a key word, you can raise your hand
        - circle some keywords for me
        - tell me what this question is asking, or what this question is asking you to do
        - Let me know what this question is actually asking what what
        - Okay
        -  So can you tell me where the main words of this question?
        -  But first of all, I want you to pay attention to this question, hey, pay attention to all the words in the details
        - You know, like we have to pay attention to another key word that is in the question
        - So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question?
        -  We have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for
        -  But remember, in order to have an answer
        -  Okay, so what are the main words of this question
        - And pay attention to these question
        - I want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is, and circle that okay?
        - everybody take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is
        - Did everybody take a second to pre read the question and circle the most important part
        -  Okay
        - But it's important to look at the language of the question and say, oh, is this the is this, am I looking for an oxygen tank
        -  Is that going to help them find water?
        -  Now you can raise your hand, but I will wait 15 seconds to let everybody think
        - And identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text, you can use that word to think about to help you answer the prompt or the question, if you have an answer ready for me
        - I would like you some of the tools that help us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information and our reading is to look at the question in this and figure out what is it asking us
        -  So I'd like you to take a minute
        -  What you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for
        - Take your take your pencil and circle
        -  So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled
        - is really instead of going straight to the text let's really know that we understand the question so before we turn that to the text  let's Can someone tell me exactly what the question is asking what is it asking us to find
        - If we don't have a really solid understanding of what is being asked so with That said, what is the question asking us to find in the article that we read
        - yeah so a really good way to think about that, when we're reading Our question is it says, did they used to discover water on the moon, and you can look
        - So looking for keywords like that
        - So i'm going to give you all about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question
        - So, right now, I want you to identify the object that we're looking for from the question by circling equipment
        - underline the last part the scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - So I think the most important thing is you already got the most important on the equipment we're going to underline the equipment
        - and underline to discover water, the moon right
        - But let's look at the question again let's see what is the key word and the question are using that's really important everybody look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two key words that you think the question that's important and the question
        - So what do you think the most important words in that question are? What words are kind of giving us clues as to the answer that they want?
        -  What other words, do you think it's going to help us to figure out exactly what the question is asking
        -  STUDENT?
        - and I can see one other word in that question that gives us a clue as to, or is going to help us figure out what we're looking
        - Yes, I will describe it to you so in with this particular question in order to make sure it's fully answered you want to make sure you're one answering the specific question that's being asked
        - Look for those little clues in the text in the question
        - Of the strategy that we just did with Question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for
        - Right, so if the question so sort of what we you know when you when you analyze things you read, we can look at specifically what the question is asking and
        - Like a treasure hunt right So what if you could take a second and circle, the words in the question that you'd be looking for STUDENT
        - so this leads us into a good activity where I want you all to reread the prompt and I want you to circle, the most important word in the process so just take a minute and go ahead and do that
        - and you're right, it is small, and they do need a microscope but my concern is that your response, need the piece of equipment that made the initial discovery right,
        - about what exactly the question is asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question
        - All right back to the question at hand, everyone I want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for
        - But one thing I want you to focus on at that you as well, because you to have pretty similar answers I want you to focus on the key action word, so we have that word discover right
        - cells to do that let's go ahead and look back at the first question, and what I want you to do this is like a really like he tip that would be super helpful and you could use later on to
        - So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it
        - So look back at the question and then I want you to read it and pick the most important word that will help us answer the question take 10 seconds and then we'll come back
        - So what I want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three key words and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that okay let's start
        - Can everyone circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it
        - To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question
        - what's the important word in the question
        - But actually i'd like us all to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself Read over the question and maybe circle some key words or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that
        - can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me, and maybe just two or three words, what is the question asking
        - Great that is completely correct and I want you to focus on two pieces of that question I want you to focus on that first word which is equipment and the second one, which is discover
        - Okay, so what According to scientists use discover discover water on the moon so what's an important part of that question that we need to what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about
        - so you can follow that thread to the correct response
        - um STUDENT um
        - So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question
        -  STUDENT, you have a question?
        - cool so going back to our question like STUDENT said what are some key words or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question, what are we looking for, and the question does anyone know
        - Nice cool cool good good so with that you know what we're looking for with the equipment can we break that down a little bit more what are some words or some key words that we can relate to equipment that will help us find
- intent: r210.1
  examples: |
        - An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water
        - Okay, do you want to share your answer with us
        - Right to help them survive
        - Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right
        - Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate
        -  Okay
        - Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?
        -  Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy
        - Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time
        - I can't really can't carry
        -  They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the
        -  That's right
        -  Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful
        - Yeah, they used to go home
        - Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how
        - But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence
        -  But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope
        - What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter
        -  So your answer actually would be correct
        -  But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters
        - You would need a microscope
        - But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live
        -  And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen
        -  And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things
        - Yeah, that that was a very good answer
        -  You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen
        -  So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen
        - Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen
        -  And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe
        - And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things
        -  For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it
        -  Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have
        - Okay, they do use that in space
        -  But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water
        -  So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water
        -  Find, is a perfect word
        -  So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time
        - That's absolutely right
        - To address STUDENT question, I would just like to clarify
        -  So when we talk about NASA here were first of all two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here
        -  So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground
        - Water on the moon be valuable
        - Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this
        - Each each STUDENTice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks
        - The question was looking for the specific STUDENTice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for
        - But is that the specific STUDENTice used to find the microscopic water samples?
        - Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space
        - Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it
        -  You could just say a rug
        -  You guys have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them
        - Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house
        - Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that STUDENT as well
        - Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter
        - I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but
        - Yes
        - on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how
        -  So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it
        - Right
        -  So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment
        - So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable
        -  This is a a question that asked for your opinion
        - So, people might have different opinions, but all opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text
        -  Some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions
        -  That's okay if you disagree with each other
        - So we might disagree with each other
        -  Does anyone know what a partial answer means?
        - Okay, so I put all of us into this group because everyone here has a partial answer
        - Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water
        -  I was like, Well, I thought about this all night
        - that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA
        - I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have all these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph
        -  Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well
        - And that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment
        -  You need different tools for different tasks right? STUDENT
        - Possibly
        - But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans
        - So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?
        - yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA
        - That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,
        - and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there
        - So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water STUDENT and you find something yeah okay
        - Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while
        - yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks
        - And that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong you guys had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers
- intent: r120.1
  examples: |
        -  Do you think you know it
        - STUDENT
        - Does anybody know
        - So look back at your answer
        - Is that all that they used?
        - Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle
        -  You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer
        - STUDENT Let's talk about your answer
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool
        -  Did they have to use
        -  Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate
        -  Did you find that answer in there?
        - STUDENT
        -  So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - Hi everybody
        - STUDENT, what else do you think?
        -  Can you gues do that?
        - So STUDENT and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and Luis I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used
        -  How do we answer this question
        -  What was your response?
        - So STUDENT our science expert, out of paragraph two
        - Okay, perfect
        -  So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - How about you and STUDENT kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Okay
        -  Let's discuss your answer real quick
        -  The paragraph number
        - Number three
        -  Read again number three
        - Okay, do you have something to add to STUDENT's answer
        - STUDENT, you want to add something?
        - What do you think this STUDENT?
        - Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon
        - But what did they use to find actually water on the moon
        -  But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon
        -  What do you think that should be a good answer to that question
        - Yes, that is an answer
        -  Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over
        - Let's see, STUDENT
        -  Would you like more time?
        - What is the question actually ask us
        -  No
        - Using this strategy
        -  How would you answer that question
        - Would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer?
        - Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer
        - So we can go ahead and go back
        -  I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up
        - Is there anything you want to maybe add to that
        - But I want us to go back and look at that again
        - To see if there is convincing evidence because
        -  I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer
        - And so let's look back and see
        -  So, STUDENT and Oliveron
        - but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing
        -  Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon
        -  Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon
        - So, STUDENT, and Jazmin
        -  You guys have been working together and STUDENT, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?
        - But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water
        -  Did they use to find that water
        - So what machine
        - What do you guys think about that
        - I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it
        -  So look back in paragraph 3
        - OK
        -  So STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  But what else did you need to know?
        - Right
        - You guys look
        - Back at the sin to me
        - Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for
        -  Do you think it would
        - So re rethink about that
        -  Did you find any more information
        - Allright STUDENT while you were reading
        - Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better
        - and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it
        - All right, STUDENT, um, what was, what was your response
        - but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water
        - You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers,
        - Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read
        - But what did they use on the moon to discover water
        -  Do you know what that that tool was called
        -  So, STUDENTon Farrah
        -  What was the tool that they used on the moon
        - Oh
        - Does anybody have an idea
        - Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs
        - Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment
        - Um, what is the question asking us
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Can you just tell me what that question means
        - So on there, you can make that on so again
        - Raise your hand when you find find an answer
        - So what's another word
        - STUDENT, what is the second heading
        -  Everybody taken another second
        -  I'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text
        - Yes, let's go back and look
        - What did you get out of the question
        - What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though
        -  So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon
        -  Okay
        - Good
        - Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think
        - So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use
        -  Is there any other equipment that we need
        - What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it
        - Was there anything else in the text
        -  STUDENT I want you to keep thinking and Miss to
        -  STUDENT, Mr
        - So Mr
        -  I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see
        - STUDENT
        - You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?
        - and I have your answers so STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        -  Did you see any other tools that you may need
        - Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it
        - but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon
        - Alright, so, from what I read what other
        - item that they need on the moon
        - Alright so STUDENT Can you help me out after reading the story again
        - Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text
        - Can you find a different one?
        - That wasn't STUDENT or Luis's answer?
        - So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question
        -  STUDENT what's up it's your turn
        - it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include
        -  So STUDENT, do you want to try?
        - So I want someone else to answer my question again
        -  Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time
        -  Maybe STUDENT, do you want to try it? Farrah, do you want to try
        -  OK
        - Does anyone else want to try the question again besides STUDENT? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time
        - Okay, what else?
        - Ok
        -  What else?
        - So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay
        - Give you time to think about it
        - Okay, I'll call on you in a second
        - So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found
        - That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?
        - Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger
        - so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of
        - An answer for that
        -  How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed
        - Okay
        - Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that
        - And that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me?
        - Good so when you go and you look through the text, I want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay
        - What STUDENT?
        -  Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT
        -  Huh
        - Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully
        - Well that's, well, that's great
        -  So, STUDENT, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?
        - Uh-huh
        -  Oh, you know what else?
        - And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer
        - So well I check in with STUDENT
        -  Do you think that you could work on that a little bit
        - I think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use
        -  What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question
        - So maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer
        -  Okay
        - Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer
        - Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey
        -  STUDENT I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer
        -  What did we learn
        -  So after reading that statement
        - Thank you, STUDENT
        - You can, did you want to give that a try
        - Can you try
        - Try again
        -  Huh
        -  Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text
        - I see some few shaking their head
        -  No
        - And see if you can find something different
        -  Please raise your hand and let me know
        - Okay
        -  We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used
        -  And when you get to that part
        -  Okay
        - What do we think they used
        - I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,
        - So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share
        -  Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text
        - Water
        - Can you remember what was that?
        -  So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out
        - Yeah
        - Yeah
        -  So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research
        - So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer
        -  So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that
        -  Are you able to do that for me
        -  Yes
        - Great
        - If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine
        - let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water
        - um do you STUDENT or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about
        - Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that STUDENT helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using
        - so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water
        - You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure
        - You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something
        - Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon
        - STUDENT, can you add on
        - so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us
        - Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use
        - Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down
        - Right and
        - Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start
        - So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence
        - So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water
        - Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?
        - Remember, something else
        - but um let's let's keep building on that right good STUDENT
        - Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph STUDENT do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer
- intent: r130.3
  examples: |
        - No
        -  What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So, to make our answer better
        -  We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Okay then not full of water
        -  Once they found it
        - So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it
        -  You had to use a microscope
        -  You can't even see it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny
        - It is
        -  But they didn't use it to discover the water
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose
        - They might
        - Use
        - The microscope is used for a different purpose
        -  They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon
        - They do, yeah
        -  But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose
        -  We're trying to figure out which
        -  That makes sense
        - Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon
        - So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource
        - It would take a long time
        -  But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as STUDENT, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So that should have been your answer
        -  They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water
        - No
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful
        - Well, they didn't send a microscope
        -  They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right
        - They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon
        - And see the surface of the moon
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - equipment that they used
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry
        - Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it
        -  They had to use a microscope
        - Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope
        - So we were looking for
        -  They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  They sent the lunar orbiter up
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that
        -  Right
        -  So instead, it it checked for water on the moon
        - And it went
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon
        -  Yes
        -  Right?
        - Mm hmm
        -  And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope
        - Things like the microscope
        -  Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean
        -  Right
        - And the Lunar Orbiter
        -  We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things
        -  Okay
        - OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - and the ice deposits
        -  That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        -  They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things
        - So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water
        - Yeah
        -  So first they had to find it
        -  And then they could investigate using the microscope
        -  But as they were as time goes on It could be
        -  I think that it could be valuable
        - Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet
        - Yeah
        -  So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future
        -  It can be valuable
        -  Does that make sense
        - So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one
        -  That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water
        -  And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water
        - Yes
        - So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter
        -  And that's what they used to see the ice deposits
        - Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off
        -  So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow
        -  Right
        -  So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - looks for ice deposits
        - And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had
        -  But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon
        - And that was the orbit
        - NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin
        -  It's am from our end
        -  I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage
        -  Correct
        -  They talk about NASA as STUDENT was talking, they do send a small machine
        - Okay, but in the top of the reading
        - And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which STUDENT brought up and Oliver
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water
        -  Okay
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they helped find water
        - Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink
        -  So that's a valuable way that we could use water now
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water
        - That isn't what they used to discover it
        -  They sent a machine up there
        - Um, I don't think so
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen
        - So you might have circled water as well
        - So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water
        - But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        -  Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter
        -  The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter
        - So even though we're not using the water right now
        -  So in this case, they didn't
        -  It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope
        - But there's other ways to detect it
        - but they use a different tool on the moon to discover
        - When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon
        -  But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time
        - That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely
        -  And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely
        - Right
        -  Yes
        -  And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, STUDENT, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay
        -  Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Okay, yes
        - but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, STUDENT was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father
        - So when we write our answer
        - We would, we would say
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        -  What does it do was
        -  they're looking for
        -  It's not capitalized like your name, STUDENT's capitalized, Chris is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not
        -  But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer
        - And that is the name
        -  So in the text
        - Nope
        -  It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits
        -  Correct?
        - However, I think that they have a plan for the water
        - and based off the paragraphs as STUDENT said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons
        - So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate
        -  It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope
        - What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely
        - Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        -  So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine
        -  It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use
        - I don't really think they could have
        -  So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are?
        - But if we were to choose one answer to be correct
        -  Right
        - However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there
        -  I would probably go with the lunar orbit
        -  That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it
        - And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon
        - we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        - Yes
        - So that's where you found about the microscope
        - Close
        -  I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there
        - Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?
        - So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something
        - You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water
        -  However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope
        - Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water
        - But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water
        - Like STUDENT, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter
        - Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes STUDENT
        - yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter
        - But the last passage has our answer in it
        - Do you, you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water I think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators
        - yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose
        - is to travel around the moon and discover
        - new findings
        - So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent
        -  Those are some options
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - That is, that is correct
        -  So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water
        -  Does anyone have any questions about that?
        - but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign
        - All right
        -  So yeah, you're right
        -  They did send a small machine, but just so everybody knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon
        - So there's actually two answers
        -  So that's another tool
        - So if we look in the reading
        -  We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use
        - is actually called a microscope
        - And that's what actually finds the water
        - yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water
        - when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water
        - that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water
        - So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too
        - um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes STUDENT
        - but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter
        - or microscopes when looking for the water
        -  When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter
        -  OK?
        -  And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter
        - So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture
        - But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter
        -  STUDENTon? I mean Oliver, sorry
        -  And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope
        - So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening
        -  So like you, STUDENT
        -  But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  You explained that they sent a small machine
        - It's a Lunar Orbiter
        - But they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity
        - And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter
        - Even though lunar orbiter is, which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists, a closer look
        -  What we want to actually
        - Think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used, which is the Lunar Orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text, it looks for ice deposits in large craters
        - Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes STUDENT?
        - So what I thought would be the answer I was answering it would be the Lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water, so I thought it would be both
        - And they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome,
        - There's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon
        - So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?
        - Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon
        - that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate
        - You know, we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the Lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead
        - and on paragraph two, you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water,
        - so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two, I saw that I found a lunar lunar orbiter
        - No
        - Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?
        - we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter
        -  But it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water
        - So a microscope is a piece of equipment
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        -  So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water
        - Right, there were two
        -  But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use
        - Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer
        - So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink
        - it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water
        -  They use all that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general
        -  So that was helpful for them to be able to be there
        -  And then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to Discover that water
        - Mm hmm
        -  Exactly
        - The lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water
        -  Mm hmm
        -  Awesome
        -  So that's all you would have to add to your answers, just that you can have more of its supply to you so they can drink it
        - Right
        - Teacher : Um, but it's a small machine that's called Old Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - But we also need STUDENT's part of the answer that
        -  How did they even get the water down here
        -  They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it
        - That's right
        -  So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes STUDENT
        -  That's right
        -  Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them
        - So even though this astronauts went up there
        -  They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope
        - Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - But with this specific question the answer that
        -  is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water
        - The right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what NASA sent on to investigate the water on the moon
        - It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon
        -  So that should have been the answer that we wrote down
        - But I just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing
        - The correct answer is a lunar orbiter
        - But the first the first equipment that they sent discovered is water was the lunar arbiter
        -  The Lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine
        -  Okay
        - But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter
        - awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does
        - you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well
        - Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture
        - and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water
        - so that's why you know the Lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question
        - We actually do have water and craters here on earth
        - they put the microsope
        - it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water
        - And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water
        - Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water
        - Yes, yeah it's true when you go swimming you go, you have to go through in the deep water, so that you know you have fun, but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not  in the deep water they went to the
        - Oh yeah but I don't think they This time they sended those kinda equipment equipment, because on the moon, they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches, but not this time I don't think
        - yeah scientists found the evidence, but scientists found the evidence, but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and  then found the thing right
        - They went sent the machine to put the moon and , then they found some water right, yes, STUDENT
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way I know all I need to know
        - Because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water
        - yeah so that will be the answer
        - Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter
        - so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two
        - uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three
        - the scientists in this paragraph, according to the text, they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface
        - So the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up, if you agree with
        - so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water
        - If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,
        -  Totally right
        - But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second STUDENT I wanted to talk about Luis's note Luis's answer on the oxygen tanks
        - The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery, can you see that now, and the response
        - they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right
        - they have a satellite go up right to do all of this
        - To investigate right
        - Investigators is the same thing as discover right,
        - The lunar orbiter right
        - about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon
        - Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay
        - fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah STUDENT
        - yeah but um I if we're looking at this question in particular right, we do need to focus on  that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was
        - Well, I think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary, that the machine is called a lunar orbiter
        - they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter
        - The surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland, so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water
        - you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters, but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water, instead of full of water,
        - so the craters are not full of water, they contains water yeah
        - um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic
        - so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text
        - So for you to
        - Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for
        - So you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely STUDENT
        - Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater
        - That was just something that was on the moon
        - So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article
        - into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable
        - No, so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in
        - I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well
        - yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter
        - There we go yeah good job, so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit
        - And um I also noticed, you know STUDENT like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find
        - That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope

        - Okay, so whenever we're reading We want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question
        -  So as we're reading, if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking
        -  You can use that strategy over and over for the rest of your life
        - To all future questions in the text
        -  Right
        - What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
        - So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question
        -  And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do
        - And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us
        - You are correct
        -  So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific,
        - So now that you've figured out the full answer
        -  What will you do next time to when you're looking back in the text
        - Alright so next time
        - Go back and look in the story to find your answer
        - so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better
        - And how you will apply what you learned in your next task so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering
        - So we can start with STUDENT and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second Luis, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question
        - we're just going to go around STUDENT, what do you think first you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task
        - And last but not least, STUDENT What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
        - So next time you answer a question like that
        -  What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using,
        - Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at all, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge
        - Right that's good that's why we're in school right because we don't know everything I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write
        - Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are all the way there yet
        -  So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information
        - Right, so you went back and read
        -  What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
        - I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this
        -  I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook
        - And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future
        -  That's excellent
        -  So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text all the information there
        - That's right
        - So next time we have, we're answering
        -  Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do
        - Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text
        -  What are you going to do that
        - And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy
        - You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence
        - Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay
        - Specific name and of the things that you described okay
        -  Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question
        - Yeah
        -  We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion
        - or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these
        - Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question
        - And what about that, and when you guys are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?
        - So what do you think you would do next time to
        - What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?
        - what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text so here i'm going to give you a new question if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question you ready?
        - How, what did you learn right What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this person
        - Great Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine
        - So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers
        - Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
        - Okay, what could you do next time
        - What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
        - Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said
        - How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down
        - Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question
        - Hi Welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it i'm STUDENT as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, yes, Ehtan
        - So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and
        - So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text
- intent: r430.3
  examples: |
        - Okay, so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph
        -  So let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question
        -  STUDENT
        -  Does that make sense
        -  Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon
        -  So instead of oxygen tanks
        - Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment
        -  See ifyou can find equipment that helped scientist, the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water
        -  That's a key word in the question is equipment
        -  This time, can you also look and see if you can find the equipment
        -  Does that make sense?
        - Okay, so you are right NASA did send a small machine, but instead of looking for the machine
        -  So we're looking
        -  Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon
        -  Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment
        -  The same thing applies for yours
        - Okay, so they did that is true, they did find water on the moon, but now
        -  And you using context clues to find that exact name for that equipment
        - But they also had to use the more specific tool to look at the water itself
        -  So yeah, you guys all had similar good answers, but you wanted to dig a little deeper to find the exact answer
        - But that's not what they used to discover it
        -  Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon
        -  Can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water
        -  Can you go ahead and look there and give me a response
        - I just want to make sure we understand
        -  So maybe in the future use that information
        -  But just make sure inside of whatever given takes that you have that you take it, maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that
        -  Sure
        -  So what it's asking
        - But not necessarily applicable to this specific text
        -  I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher
        - It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time
        - question if you're confused and look closely at the passage
        - If you look at what the positives are it might outweigh the time that it takes, so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon  so STUDENT can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon
        - But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon, if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used
        -  So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks
        - But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question
        -  So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also
        - But I do not believe that was in the article itself
        - So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior
        -  I want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for that specific answer that you need
        - But I am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text
        -  Do you want to try that
        - I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right
        -  So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words
        - What I'd like you to do, though, is look a little bit closer in the reading
        -  I want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that shows what tools they use
        -  So as you're reading and you're making those real world connections
        - So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon?
        -  Okay
        -  I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water
        - How they would get to the water on the moon
        -  So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon, why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water
        - But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right, and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water
        - But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text
        - But you want to base your answer off of the reading you don't want to go off on your own path, just in case it isn't right now, you might have thought it was one thing, but it's not actually what it is, so you want to face what you see in the reading and then put that into your answer
