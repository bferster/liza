        - that's awesome that's awesome before we get started, I want to ask, if you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group
        - Has he told you about these kind of thing
        - Oh, that is so awesome
        - When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month
        - Does that make sense?
        - So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes
        - Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end
        - Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?
        - Have you ever seen something through a microscope
        - Yes, what thing that you see
        - That's really good
        - Well, it sounds exciting
        - Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - Well science videos, my family
        - We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,
        - Um like a refrigerator
        - Kind of how I think about it
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade
        - I wanted to be an astronaut
        - But, you know, that was my goal
        - So obviously I didn't live up to that
        - Kennedy center, or--
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F
        - Was it fun?
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy
        - I'm gonna go back to Luis because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts
        - Is a while you're looking at it
        - but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?
        - Has anyone ever use a microscope before?
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        - Invite me
        - To the next time
        - What do you say,
        - How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game
        - So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at
        - Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories
        - You're sitting there were at school
        - All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know
        - So what's an equipment you have right now
        - Thats helping you with your work, Chris
        - But right now, you every one of your student at school, right
        - And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets
        - Now, just like when they did their research
        - You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing
        - So did you enjoy reading the passage
        - I don't want you to write down what all you know about space
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        - I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let Farrah, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space
        - Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space
        - Alright, so let's go over
        - It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close
        - Yeah, like a magnifying glass
        - How many of you have ever seen a microscope
        - All right, so Chris
        - Where did you see a microscope at
        - What do you want me to tell me about space Luis?
        - Oh you already know a lot about space
        - You are correct
        - When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment
        - I went to NASA as well
        - I had a great time there as well
        - Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert
        - Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert
        - It seems like you learned something today
        - Oh, well, that's great
        - Tell me what you know about space
        - There's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others
        - But if you read it
        - Where do you read it up
        - Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible
        - That's super cool
        - Anything could happen
        - Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening
        - So I mean, at this point in time and this year
        - So give me some examples of tools
        - Debbie had your hand raised
        - Can you give me an example of a tool
        - Is there anybody else that wanted to share a tool
        - That's absolutely right
        - What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip
        - So if you drive very far
        - You are right, think about like a gas station
        - They wouldn't get stranded
        - And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station
        - You won't run out of gas
        - And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station
        - We're not gonna turn back around, right
        - We'll just get more gas and keep going
        - Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer
        - Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher
        - So like an ant
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes
        - Oh, like organisms
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr Oliveron
        - We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O
        - Okay, so where we left off
        - Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope
        - Yes, you do
        - what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?
        - Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not
        - that's really cool fact Chris, where did you read that
        - Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,
        - How did they get to the moon
        - Well, since you've gone there
        - Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there
        - That that's really cool
        - I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that
        - That's really cool
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something
        - Does everybody here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you
        - Yes, Farrah
        - Is there anymore knowledge you guys have
        - You went to NASA? Really?
        - Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so Luis has as well
        - Yeah, yeah
        - would anyone ever want to go to space
        - And experience this
        - What about you, would you want to or would you not
        - The water is hiding in the craters
        - Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time
        - So you like to read
        - Do you like to garden yourself Jazmin
        - That's, I love that answer
        - You know all about space really where did you learn about space
        - Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum
        - Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older
        - You are so passionate about space
        - How is everyone doing please raise your hand
        - Good afternoon, everyone
        - Oh, thank you, Oliver
        - Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward
        - That's pretty amazing
        - Luis I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter
        - So can you tell me what what do you know about space
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know
        - I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base
        - Go ahead
        - I like that shirt I have the same shirt
        - Actually, that's a really cool shirt
        - I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters
        - But we never think about how it would be to actually exist
        - There are walk around on the moon
        - So I agree with you
        - I think that's a really cool thing
        - Were you surprised Farrah, that the scientists found water on the moon
        - I think that's what the scientists thought too
        - Yeah, me either
        - how about you, Oliver
        - Were you surprised
        - How about you, Jazmin
        - Were you surprised
        - That's a really good reason to be reading current news
        - That's it
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new
        - How about you, Chris
        - So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me
        - I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night
        - Me too
        - I thought this was great
        - Me too
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there
        - Luis or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article
        - So Luis did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts
        - yeah and Jazmin like was this the spark any interest in you or yes
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on
        - awesome thanks Luis okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday
        - Luis, why do you want to go to the moon
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone
        - Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know
        - yeah so in Spanish it's Luna
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why Chris, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact
        - yeah Luis Do you know anything else about the moon
        - What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity
        - No way Chris that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see Farrah
        - that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible
        - what's your favorite thing about space Luis
        - Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - Oliver, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?
        - Oh, what kind of stuff did you see
        - Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon
        - Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer
        - Oh, what do you know about space
        - Jazmin could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?

  examples: |
        - that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in
        - i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge
        - yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to NASA that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and I think you and Luis probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing
        - Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group Luis
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn
        - um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um Luis
        - Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question
        - Well, that would be awesome
        - I didn't know that you taught me something
        - So I'm glad you're here with us
        - You don't think you should be in this group
        - Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered
        - So Luis Can you help me understand
        - I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space
        - Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way
        - You know all about space?
        - Luis, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them
        - Oh, nice
        - Thumbs up
        - I love that you know about oxygen
        - That's awesome
        - For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks
        - I'm sure they do and I bet that Luis could probably tell you more and you can share that information together
        - Luis, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about
        - So I know that you can really help us out here
        - And I know that you know a lot about space
        - And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there
        - So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better
        - That's wonderful
        - Does that sound okay
        - Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently
        - What a fun experience
        - That's a great connection
        - How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that
        - Yeah, that's great
        - We need you in here to help help us out
        - Oh well, Luis, and that's exactly why we need you in here
        - Okay, thank you for that
        - Luis Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this group today since you know a lot about space
        - Now, Luis, our science expert
        - Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing
        - Oh, you were there
        - Maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there
        - That is really cool
        - Wow, that seems really awesome
        - That's why you know a lot about space
        - Luis your dad is an astronaut
        - So maybe today or in another class, you can share something that you have learned from your dad
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class
        - You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share
        - Well, even
        - So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it
        - Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about
        - I'm happy to hear that
        - It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,
        - That's very exciting
        - That's incredibly exciting
        - I would hope that that's the case
        - And with water here that could help us in our future exploration
        - We're very excited to see that
        - I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge
        - We know that Chris did visit NASA
        - You can help me out with the other kids
        - How about that once you just chill out for a minute
        - What you have Luis is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic
        - That's great
        - Okay so awesome
        - Awesome so Luis used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome
        - Awesome Chris, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage
        - So, and Luis was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment
        - Can we all agree on that
        - So what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies
        - And Chris, that's really cool
        - Well, maybe you can help the others
        - It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading
        - And so that's a great thing to share with the class
        - And so Chris when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them
        - Does anyone else have an experience that similar?
        - Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help
        - So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it
        - Or maybe you could see if your classmates
        - Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions
        - Okay, that would be great
        - Thanks for for helping us out
        - Or maybe you could help us out
        - What do you think
        - So we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more
        - Well, just like last time you had something to contribute to the group
        - and you'll be able to share all your knowledge
        - And I'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you
        - So we are going to listen to our friends
        - Okay, thank you for your input
        - But every time we learn something we continue growing and learning
        - Luis You use very good background information
        - We know that you know about space
        - Okay, we are going to use your
        - Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us
        - With more information about what we're learning
        - Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet
        - We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us
        - Do you really?
        - Right, Chris and that's sort of what Luis said too, right? So that's great that you're using your background knowledge
        - Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this group so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better
        - That's very neat
        - I bet that was-- I've seen some of this equipment
        - Thank you so much, Chris
        - So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it
        - Well, we can always learn new things about topics
        - Oh, that's okay
        - Oh well, I really need you to stay in our group and and you can help me with like information and things
        - You can help you can be my helper
        - Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away
        - That is awesome that you know all the extra stuff
        - And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your
        - Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - Okay, well, maybe you can help us
        - Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is
        - Alright, well I'm glad you know all of that information
        - There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space
        - Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA
        - That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes
        - Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible
        - So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use
        - Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but
        - maybe you can help your partner's out Luis I think you would be a great addition to our group
        - That you know all about space
        - Oh, well that's really great
        - Maybe you can add to our conversation
        - That's, that's awesome
        - But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive
        - And it will help you
        - I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that
        - Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this group then
        - Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in
        - But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?
        - That's great that you know that stuff
        - Yes, but you can help some of the other students
        - So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well
        - You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses
        - And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay
        - Right, Luis, so you'll be able to share some information with us
        - Luis What was something that you said that scientists use
        - Your right and so, Luis, said the same thing, right
        - Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space
        - And no, you are not wrong
        - Chris and Luis I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources
        - And I think that that's awesome
        - So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this
        - and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge
        - Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material
        - I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need all the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today
        - I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today
        - That's a good point
        - Okay, so, and Luis brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that
        - Now in school right and we're learning differently
        - Alright, so let's go back to our question
        - Some things are different
        - And you guys have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners
        - Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance
        - Thank you, Luis, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work
        - I bet Luis could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?
        - That's great, Luis
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        - You know what you gave me a great idea
        - Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space
        - It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates
        - So when we cover more about space
        - Maybe I'll have you been one of our group leaders
        - Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward
        - So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts
        - Okay, so maybe you and Luis could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space
        - Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this group to help the rest of us
        - If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space
        - And maybe we could learn from each other
        - Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates
        - That's really cool
        - And that obviously shows your understanding of space
        - So that's really cool that you have that experience
        - I've never been the NASA
        - Okay, so we read it aloud
        - You read it for us because you know everything about space already
        - That I love that
        - I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away
        - But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so
        - I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there
        - That's super cool
        - Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about
        - Okay, so
        - And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group
        - For me response
        - You do know quite a lot
        - So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here
        - So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too
        - Well, thank you for letting us know Luis
        - Hopefully one day, Kevin
        - Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well
        - So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it
- intent: r150.1
  examples: |
        - So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right? All right
        - Does that sound okay
        - Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah Farrah
        - yeah so Luis we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis
        - Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means
        - Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples
        - Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def
        - Does that make sense?
        - Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is
        - does that make sense?
        - [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today
        - I'm Ms
        - So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers
        - So we have a lot of different answers
        - So let's look back in our texts
        - Let's think about it
        - And let's see if we had the best answer
        - Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question
        - So did anybody talk about that? Let's see
        - You get it?
        - Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said
        - So do you understand how we could improve your answer?
        - So that makes sense?
        - Anybody have any questions about that question?
        - That make sense?
        - Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed
        - Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers
        - so and you guys had varying levels of understanding
        - And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow
        - Um, Farrah and Oliver
        - Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer
        - And I don't think you had
        - Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,
        - Yes, Jazmin
        - Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - You understand that
        - Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused
        - How Does everybody feel after you read that passage
        - Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right
        - So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?
        - But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too
        - Chris, it's totally okay when you just-
        - So, that's okay
        - So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them
        - Do you know what that means
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?
        - What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?
        - There's always things you can learn
        - You guys see that?
        - So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you guys about your answers that you guys put For question number one
        - Yeah, I want you guys to just look at the question
        - And I want you to keep that in your mind
        - Just a minute
        - Does that make sense
        - So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is
        - Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?
        - So, let's look
        - So what did we, what did we look at and very closely
        - Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response
        - Did you have questions
        - Let's see
        - Let's look at that
        - Hey guys, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me
        - So let's take a quick look at our responses
        - I think you may still be confused Farrah
        - Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something
        - The moon and we are going to share our answers
        - So let's talk about your answers you already read the article
        - In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there
        - So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to
        - But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article
        - So you kind of see where we went wrong?
        - Today, Luis, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today
        - Thank you for your help
        - What was the Oh, pardon me, Chris, Farrah
        - And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so Chris
        - So that's good
        - Yes, question
        - That's an area we can improve
        - And you think you've got it out
        - So there were some room for
        - Does that make sense
        - That's okay
        - So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff
        - You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any
        - Does that make sense
        - Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question
        - Alright guys, any more questions can be any other way
        - So I'm Chris or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer
        - stop right there
        - So did everyone, did everyone read that with her
        - Did you read that Farrah with her? Okay
        - Chris, id you read that you
        - Luis So maybe we could look at this together
        - Appreciate that answer
        - And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        - But let's talk about this for just a minute
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way
        - And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today
        - We're going to talk about our
        - Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers
        - Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever
        - So we answered our last question
        - So we're going to move on to a new question
        - Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done
        - Alright, so let's look at the question, right
        - And let's look at your answers
        - Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer
        - Does that make sense?
        - Are there any more questions
        - Yeah, so I understand
        - And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer
        - That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text
        - So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for
        - Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading
        - What do you guys have questions about so
        - For instance,
        - So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example
        - So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to
        - So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to
        - Does everybody see that sentence
        - So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking
        - Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different
        - So we are going to think a little bit
        - Okay, so, reflecting in our answer
        - Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject
        - Okay, don't feel it's wrong
        - Thank you for for your input
        - Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more
        - And you can connect that with what you are learning
        - Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA
        - Does anybody else have any questions about their answer
        - So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does
        - You guys think so?
        - Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing
        - You guys found in the article
        - And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today
        - So I really liked reading all of your answers
        - Yeah, you got it?
        - So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers
        - It is cool
        - Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so
        - So remember back to our question
        - We just have to find convincing evidence for its value
        - And like you said, we've done that
        - We have tons of ways that it can be used
        - I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question
        - Does that make sense?
        - So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood
        - Think we all should be here
        - So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments
        - Okay, Farrah, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer
        - And that's what we're doing right now in this class
        - We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers
        - Does that sound good
        - See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence
        - I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody
        - Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route
        - I'm going to look at your responses, real quick
        - In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time
        - And that's a good response so
        - So let's think a little bit deeper about that
        - And so, so we've decided and
        - we have a lot of good information
        - Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to Luis to you read and see if you can find something different than Farrah
        - Does that answer your question, Luis
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit
        - And let's just see where we get
        - Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there
        - Did you read it for me
        - How about you, Luis
        - and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words
        - You see it?
        - And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future
        - Well, we might can look just a little bit closer
        - Would that be okay?
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys
        - Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use
        - That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track
        - So what machine discovered water
        - A lunar orbiter
        - But we could have made it just a little bit more detail
        - So do you understand how your answer was right
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better
        - Does that make sense now
        - Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter
        - So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at
        - We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it
        - Alright, so you have all shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here
        - That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn
        - Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn
        - That's awesome
        - So the question is asking us
- intent: r130.1
  examples: |
        - that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope And that microscope was used so actually sorry um
        - So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things
        - Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        - But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon
        - You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - It is semi right
        - And that is very close and
        - But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage
        - However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits
        - Then once they figured out that there was
        - Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there
        - That there was water on the moon
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope
        - It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - Not completely wrong
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment
        - And Luis you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - That's right
        - But we're going to look for one more thing
        - Could you tell me what word another word that you circled
        - One more
        - Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word
        - Other key word in the question so Farrah
        - And that's absolutely something that was in that reading
        - That is absolutely true
        - Chris scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here
        - One is kind of a version of the other slits
        - Think about it
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct
        - Yeah, and that's right, they do use that
        - So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon
        - If it were astronauts on the moon
        - That's right
        - The astronauts use all that you are correct in that,
        - So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in
        - So, that is correct
        - Everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again
        - Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points
        - They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question
        - And that was right too
        - But that was not enough for that question
        - Jazmin says that NASA sent a small machine
        - Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but
        - So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response
        - Um, I think that we can do even better
        - You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me
        - Luis So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you
        - We're almost exactly where we want to be
        - That was really, really good
        - But we're so close now
        - We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there
        - So thank you for your
        - That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope
        - And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question
        - So let's look at your answer
        - Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do
        - That's very knowledgeable of you point that out
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead
        - And we're going to dig deeper
        - Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer
        - You are right, they, they set that small machine
        - And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        - Okay, Farrah and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely
        - Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there
        - That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?
        - and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more
        - So if we put Jazmin's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer
        - Okay, so that's that's part of an up
        - The answer is that we could have more space having more room
        - And let's see
        - So that's a good start on your answer
        - Luis had a good start on his too
        - Well, it's not completely wrong
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close
        - Um, so yeah, good job
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope
        - So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer
        - That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing
        - Because yes, they would use all of that  but
        - You just need to elaborate a little bit more
        - No, it's not wrong
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon
        - That NASA sent a small machine
        - Does that make sense?
        - It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space
        - I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction
        - So I want everybody to look at the text
        - So you've got part of the answer, right?
        - In the polar craters
        - You've got a piece of it
        - Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was
        - They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it
        - Well, you're right
        - But what you have is a great start
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now
        - And that is correct
        - So you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,
        - They do need that
        - So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe
        - Okay, so they did find
        - Craters water on the moon,
        - You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong
        - And Chris, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - They did
        - In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water
        - Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer
        - And because Luis just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this
        - And so, Hey Luis I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct
        - So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space
        - Okay, yeah, you're right
        - And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question
        - Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct
        - And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like Luis said
        - So looking at your responses
        - I will say this, Jazmin
        - You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response
        - Chris, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, they did find craters with water
        - All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right
        - Okay, good
        - So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it
        - Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - But they did find water in some of those places
        - That's not entirely true
        - We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you guys said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things
        - What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope
        - So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool
        - So great job
        - So you were right in that it was a small machine
        - So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet
        - So you're absolutely right
        - Those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon
        - There's definitely no oxygen in space,
        - And that would be that would be correct
        - It's part of the answer
        - Well, it's part
        - Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine
        - That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was
        - And Chris, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water
        - Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon
        - So, good job
        - Yeah, yeah
        - I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden
        - Did you look at discover
        - It's not that it was the wrong answer
        - It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question
        - They're using a microscope to see the water
        - So you both are on the right track here in the equipment
        - You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is
        - So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine
        - NASA does use all types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things
        - So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits
        - So, you are correct
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope
        - So you're partially right when you kind of say that the
        - I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a
        - Oh, that's really interesting
        - Let's talk about it, Luis
        - So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's
        - I can tell you read part of the text
        - That's true
        - So again, that's true
        - And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water
        - All right, but you're definitely on the right
        - You guys are really thinking and I like where you're headed
        - Farrah and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon
        - And you guys are both on the right track
        - Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use
        - Those are some great observations
        - But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I think you we're on the right track
        - And the scientific tool
        - Her perfect so Jazmin, you were absolutely on the right track
        - You're absolutely right
        - So a lot of equipment is huge
        - They do
        - But what we have to do
        - I think you guys did a great job and you were on the right track
        - They absolutely do
        - Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking
        - Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there
        - Was not with that microscope
        - So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I think that with all of her answers
        - We're all getting on the right track
        - You are getting to the right answer
        - They use the microscope to look closely at the water
        - Yes, I know what you mean
- intent: r110.1
  examples: |
        - And Oliver I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.
        - hi Jazmin I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you
        - yeah awesome so you identify and equipment
        - Yes, ice and ice deposits, yes Chris
        - Yes, good the investigation part is good, let me look at the question again
        - Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah
        - All right, i'll let you think about that question, while I work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay
        - yeah that's a great answer Jazmin
        - Luis can I have just a second
        - yeah they do Chris
        - yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords
        - Absolutely, what about you Jazmin
        - Chris, what about you
        - That's really cool
        - But let's get back on topic
        - Um, well, you're right
        - Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question
        - Farrah, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope
        - That would be really cool
        - A, then, what were you gonna say
        - You did some great reading Oliver
        - Let's just hang out for a minute
        - Let's talk about some things
        - Okay hold on just a moment
        - Yes, and Jazmin
        - Yes, they did
        - He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Also Chris's answer
        - All right, thank you for your answers
        - You're right, you're right
        - I appreciate you guys coming in today you've all done a very good job
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And that question and you answered it
        - So you guys did really good writing down an answer
        - I'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph
        - All right, well, that's awesome
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what Farrah had said
        - Thanks, Jazmin
        - I'm so glad you're ready to help
        - Yes, there is a lot of equipment that gets used
        - Yes, that was really interesting
        - I love that
        - What a good observation
        - That is really cool
        - I love all of those answers
        - Yeah, that was a big question
        - That's a really good observation
        - I love that
        - Okay, I like that answer a lot and Chris, would you like to add anything to that
        - That's very true
        - Jazmin, what would you like to add
        - Oh, let's wait your turn, please
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - You're doing a great job of listening
        - Thank you for clarifying that
        - Okay, let me let me talk with Jazmin for just a moment and I'll come back to you
        - You're absolutely right
        - Is that what you put
        - I have written, I have that you put scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay, while are you looking for
        - I'm going to talk with the other four
        - I'm really proud of you guys for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - Oliver, you put the same thing I Farrah
        - So I'm Farrah
        - What I have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close
        - Okay and I'm going to talk with Chris and Jazmin and Luis
        - I saw you, that you put NASA sentma small machine
        - Jazmin in your answer
        - So very good job, um,
        - And I do want to give you guys a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers
        - Just looked at your revised answers
        - So we'll talk about that here in just a minute
        - Yeah, NASA does have
        - Thank you for your input, Luis But I just asked Farrah a question
        - Would you mind letting her respond?
        - Ah, there we go
        - Very good, thank you
        - Thank you for sharing now
        - There you go
        - Very good
        - So that is the answer that we're looking for
        - That is correct
        - Thank you
        - And I think, Oliver you had said the same thing is Farrah
        - Then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that Astronauts use
        - You said that they use lots of equipment
        - Luis Thank you for reading that again for us
        - So you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely
        - Well, that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer
        - And Deb, you had the same answer
        - Didn't you
        - Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah
        - That was something super interesting
        - That would be really, really great
        - Ooh, that would be awesome
        - Good awesome, amazing
        - Good and Farrah?
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and answer
        - Okay, thank you
        - The next class about that topic, but I think that, yes, it's a very good topic
        - Maybe, maybe, maybe we can read another article
        - Thanks, Chris
        - That's a very good answer
        - Thank you
        - Thank you, Farrah
        - Thank you
        - Good answer
        - Thank you
        - Yes, that's a really good answer
        - Yes, mean you are right
        - Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon
        - That's very good
        - That's very good
        - Um so,
        - I'm proud of you
        - That's good
        - That's good
        - Luis you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and Jazmin knocked it out of the park
        - Um, and I think another real benefit here
        - Chris and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like Luis had there and--
        - All right
        - So, Chris, what's up man, how are you
        - I appreciate it
        - That means just paying attention
        - Good job
        - That's very smart picking that up,
        - All right, good job
        - And I know that's that's
        - That's, you know, that's interesting way to think about that question
        - Let's go back to Jazmin and Luis over here while you're looking at that
        - Why don't you
        - Very good
        - That'd be pretty cool huh
        - Oh that is just around the corner
        - On Musk is doing great things so
        - You know, they're working on it
        - Thank you
        - Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope
        - So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found
        - So you found that the craters are full of water
        - Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water
        - Yes, and survey, Anna
        - So I want to go back to what Farrah was saying
        - So you all were the same
        - So when you def
        - So let's go back to what Luis Do you have a question
        - Tell me about your answer
        - Let's Jazmin, let's go back to each for just a minute
        - Keep your thoughts, just for a moment
        - Okay Luis Let's hold on just a second
        - Chris, can you hold that thought for just one moment
        - That's a good answer
        - Farrah, what would you like to add to the conversation
        - What was that question that you had?
        - Okay, Harisson, what, you had your question, a question just a few minutes ago
        - That is correct
        - They did send that
        - So we could drink it
        - Luis said we could break it down to oxygen, hydrogen, we could breathe it
        - We could use it for rocket fuel
        - That is awesome
        - Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, so that could be one thing that's useful
        - I really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it
        - So let's go ahead and talk about it
        - Alright, thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers
        - And let's see, Farrah, you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, well if you hold on to that
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        - Let's see
        - You said that you circled the same as Farrah
        - It's right on to that
        - Hold on just a minute and
        - Um, and now that we've talked about it
        - Alright, so let's see what Chris wrote
        - He recently wrote scientists found craters full of water on the moon,
        - It is important
        - We do agree on that
        - Good job
        - See that I'm glad you're still staying with our group, because that is some good insight
        - All right, let's see
        - Um, I think that would be valuable to
        - That's pretty cool
        - Um, yeah, I think, I think you have pretty good answer
        - Okay, I'm Chris
        - Well, I think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here
        - So you did have the small machine is what you said
        - Your answer was actually really close
        - so like Farrah and Oliver you guys said that you needed a scientific
        - tool called a microscope
        - Oh really, that is awesome
        - Well, I am glad that you know a lot
        - And you're right, and then also Luis also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split
        - So you guys you in depth said no and then Jazmin and Chris said yes
        - And then Luis kind of gave some details
        - Well, you might not need help, but you might be able to help me help the rest of the group
        - That is very
        - A very good way to look at that
        - Well, that's really cool
        - Oh, that's really cool
- intent: r310.1
  examples: |
        - awesome so Farrah and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points
        - amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on Even better answer
        - and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to
        - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well
        - I love that you brought in that background knowledge Luis that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
        - Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story
        - yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
        - yeah so Oliver I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
        - yeah I love, how you summarize that are Chris, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris
        - yeah Luis that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so
        - yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
        - So um Jazmin what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
        - right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon
        - Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece
        - I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
        - So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
        - Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space
        - Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that
        - So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
        - That's a good way of thinking about it, Jazmin
        - You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
        - And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that
        - And they did
        - That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
        - I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together
        - But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also
        - I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see
        - Yes, Jazmin
        - Thank you
        - And I appreciate that answer
        - You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text
        - That was one of our right answers
        - It was a right answer
        - Well, I appreciate that
        - I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that
        - And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
        - So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
        - Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money
        - Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy
        - I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
        - Um, so I can see Chris I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source
        - You did a good job
        - Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence
        - Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,
        - That's a very good point
        - So you could circle convincing evidence together
        - Yeah, that's a great idea
        - Well, that's okay
        - And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
        - Even if it's not valuable right now
        - Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
        - Now, but in the future
        - So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable
        - It would be
        - I love that Farrah, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if
        - I love that you cited where you found it in the text
        - So Farrah, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true
        - Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
        - And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing
        - You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
        - I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from
        - Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true
        - Chris, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out
        - And I'm really proud of you for finding that
        - Oh, what a nice way to explain that
        - Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small
        - Which is great and you all refer back to the text
        - You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
        - Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use
        - Thank you for that
        - That's a some awesome prior knowledge Luis
        - So I can add a bit of background info here
        - Um, so, Luis Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space
        - And you offer a lot of insight,
        - That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from
        - Well, maybe I phrased that poorly
        - Very good
        - I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
        - I think that's very good
        - I like your use of detail there
        - And that's, that's very good
        - I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
        - You give really good strong details on that very specific part
        - So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
        - Okay, that's, that's great
        - I think you've got the main idea
        - And so at the heart of your answer there
        - And that's really exciting
        - We found some water on the moon
        - Thank you very much for listening
        - Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
        - So I appreciate that
        - That was very good
        - What I said there
        - Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
        - That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out
        - But when we look back at the question
        - Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as Farrah, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking
        - And that's a good skill
        - I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and Jazmin were able to look specifically in the text
        - To use our background knowledge like Luis used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right
        - We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
        - Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer
        - And that is a great answer, our passage
        - I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it
        - Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned
        - And I see why you would say that,
        - Okay, I understand
        - I see where you get that answer,
        - I like your thinking that is awesome
        - You use details from our text to support your thinking
        - So, that's awesome
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well
        - Yes, Chris
        - It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things
        - So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is
        - Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience
        - What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
        - Good thinking, because we are talking about water
        - Okay, that's good
        - We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more
        - Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us
        - So let's see
        - Water is a valuable resource right
        - One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
        - Because that has the words we were just talking about
        - So that was just the right place to look for that
        - And you did find some evidence, didn't you
        - All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look
        - So you guys are all given really good details
        - So you guys are given really good details for that
        - I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
        - Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment
        - So I think that you justified your answer and
        - So I think that you and Chris and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable
        - And I spoke to Oliver
        - So he justified his answer
        - So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
        - You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right
        - Um, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason
        - I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
        - But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated
        - Of the water and how the water could be used
        - you summarize very well okay and about the craters
        - You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer
        - That is great
        - I like that answer
        - Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading
        - And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information
        - That's absolutely right
        - I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, Jazmin
        - They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
        - And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
        - Um, Chris
        - But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
        - That's exactly right
        - What about you,
        - I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - You are good
        - That's exactly right
        - You are good
        - So like you said your answer
        - And it looks like you've done that in your answer
        - Jazmin, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why
        - So great job
        - That's exactly right
        - Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right Farrah
        - I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water
        - But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool
        - That was very good
        - I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that
        - Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text
        - And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
        - I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
        - Yeah, yeah, you're right
        - That's awesome
        - So try to think about
        - Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer
        - I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
        - Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters
        - You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
        - All right
        - And you also found that they both talked about water
        - Now what did the question ask us to find about water
        - You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good
        - Very good
        - They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,
        - That is true
        - I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know
        - So right after that the paragraph
        - We want to be in, you're exactly right
        - Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes
        - Okay, so you did find some important information where
        - So, you made a really important
        - Good, I agree that they're not ready
        - No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know
        - They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
        - They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question
        - That's awesome
        - And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence
- intent: r210.2
  examples: |
        - So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember
        - It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense
        - Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean
        - Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that
        - Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof
        - Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer from that source
        - Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it
        - So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - We're not trying to look at it, Chris, did you have something to tell me
        - We're trying to discover it
        - What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right
        - And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that
        - Yeah, all those things are really important
        - But in this article
        - So what does equipment main guys
        - So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water
        - Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question
        - That means the same thing
        - Does anybody know a synonym for the word investigate
        - Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking
        - They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right
        - We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So when we look back at our text
        - So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object
        - You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment
        - So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters
        - But what tool where they using?
        - It's telling us to talk about what equipment
        - But if we look back at our question
        - So we need to find the equipment that they used
        - They did find water
        - But the question wants to know what equipment did they use
        - But what equipment did they use to find it?
        - That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        - But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon
        - They need oxygen
        - It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used
        - It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment
        - And the question
        - What are the ways that it's being used
        - Or how can it be useful
        - If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking
        - That would be your question
        - What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it
        - And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment
        - So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?
        - Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,
        - It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon
        - That scientists use
        - But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph
        - but we said when we circled in the second key word
        - In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word
        - It's something that they did
        - But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you guys to find was evidence and valuable yes def
        - So we know where it was
        - I wonder, it's asking about the equipment
        - So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it
        - But now we're asking about the machine
        - So they're synonyms of each other
        - So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym
        - You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool
        - do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking
        - So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?
        - Finding it but planning it for the first time
        - And remember, we're looking for equipment
        - So we're discovering water on the moon
        - but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it
        - Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon
        - We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist
        - Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of
        - Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for
        - Did they use to discover the water that's what Farrah is saying
        - Okay, what equipment
        - Yeah, so that's a really good question
        - Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like Farrah says the equipment that's used to discover the water
        - Good job
        - Equipment discover and water
        - So you guys picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover
        - Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and
        - Do you guys know what discover means
        - Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon
        - He is to discover water on the moon
        - So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist
        - So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon
        - But let's look more at that question
        - So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?
        - Specifically, right
        - but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment
        - Did they use to search for water on the moon
        - I'm sorry
        - They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment
        - They're looking for quick the equipment
        - So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon
        - let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars
        - Can you remind me what the question says,
        - But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering
        - I'm glad we're able to see that
        - A Luis Do you think that's a good idea
        - It talking about more than one piece
        - So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there
        - It could be more than one
        - But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural
        - And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water
        - Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water
        - So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water
        - So putting that together
        - Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable
        - It has the potential to be valuable
        - That means it may it that is going to be valuable
        - The water on the moon
        - What am I doing
        - So when I think of that word discover
        - And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something
        - What are we doing Jazmin
        - When I first discover something
        - I'm looking for it
        - So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water Jazmin
        - I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it
        - I remember Jazmin said when we discover something I'm finding it
        - So what what might they have used to first discover
        - So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right
        - So what equipment
        - Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon
        - Did they used to discover
        - Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things
        - But the key was what equipment
        - So, so we needed to find the equipment
        - So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it
        - So the key was what equipment
        - Did they use to discover
        - So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text
        - So what does discover mean
        - Jazmin, what is discover mean
        - Yes, that is a very good question
        - So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically
        - Okay, so what do we think valuable means
        - So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable
        - What do you think that means
        - So this is asking could water from the moon be useful
        - Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful
        - So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist
        - You think yes or no
        - So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?
        - So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing
        - Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms
        - Who remembers what term
        - There's a term
        - And the question that we're looking for
        - In the question
        - Mm hmm
        - So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right
        - Water is important
        - Yes, because the question does ask about water
        - There are key words
        - And there's one more word that we use a lot in science
        - All right, I'm convincing is good
        - Okay, so what is evidence
        - So all those equipments
        - But we was looking for the tool for water
        - But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water
        - So yes, you're right
        - Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them
        - So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage
        - So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage
        - Teacher:I feel like the way the question was phrased
        - They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um
        - I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water
        - Because the question
        - I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water
        - You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water
        - You know why its valuable
        - It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons
        - In the actual passage
        - So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable
        - That would be very beautiful, very
        - Did you find that in the text Jazmin
        - So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon
        - So is there convincing evidence
        - So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article
        - That water on the moon could be valuable
        - What it says directly
        - Now this is a tricky question
        - Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word
        - So what is the meaning of valuable there?
        - So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?
        - Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water
        - But how did they discover the water
        - I know they can look at the water with the microscope
        - Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space
        - So in the question asks us
        - But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space
        - It says what equipment
        - Where did they find it so
        - Did they use not
        - But in the question
        - So I agree
- intent: r410.3
  examples: |
        - Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon
        - yeah you you so maybe I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope Go ahead
        - Luis when we are asked to answer a question
        - It's very important that we go back in the text
        - We're back to number two
        - You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yes, Farrah
        - There's where Farrah found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it
        - They would have to use a combination of all those things
        - But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use
        - And what we can do with the water once they found it
        - but they didn't say, full of water
        - You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting
        - A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon
        - I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested
        - I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading
        - but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon
        - So, that is right, Chris
        - They do need a lot of equipment to get there
        - But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process
        - You know, a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters
        - However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text
        - You're right
        - The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?
        - I just want to kind of add some detail to it
        - They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable
        - Yeah, they definitely need space suits to be in space, but I think they might have used a specific tool in the text to see if there is water on the moon
        - But what we're looking for is more of what's in the text
        - So talking about the microscope or the lunar
        - However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading
        - But in your answer
        - Does that make sense
        - I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon
        - But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon
        - And they definitely do need to use a microscope
        - Does that make sense
        - But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part
        - This did use a lot of equipment like you said what you use your background knowledge, instead of the evidence from the text that you were supposed to eat like I wanted
        - And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water
        - Farrah, you had a great response
        - So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us
        - It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for
        - With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough
        - Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay
        - And based on your answer
        - Luis I remember in your response
        - Like Luis talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text
        - But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text
        - You, you talked about how they use equipment
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good
        - And Luis, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks
        - So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage
        - But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions
        - Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading
        - And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind
        - But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it
        - but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered
        - But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water
        - You use those
        - I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question
        - However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find
        - They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon
        - So we did use that, Luis
        - You're totally right about that one
        - That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like Farrah, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic
        - But they never said they need to use a microscope
        - But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope
        - Okay, so let's start with you
        - Luis So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon
        - So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks
        - They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage
        - but I just -did you -this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used
        - So did you have questions about the passage?
        - I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely like did you did you have questions about it?
        - Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?
        - Because we want to make sure that when you are working
        - Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of
        - and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case
        - So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know
        - I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading
        - You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then
        - Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right
        - that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just
        - Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says
        - um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object
        - person it's really great job i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert
        - Does that make sense to you
        - I want to know that you understood the reading that we did
        - But I want to know
        - But I'm a little bit concerned that you're not finding the answers in the text
        - If you'd like to follow along with me
        - Teacher : But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks, but it does say in part number two
        - I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water
        - So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading
        - That's an important information and it's good to know what is a microscope, a microscope and but there is another equipment that they use in the beginning for this Discovery
        - Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it
        - Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question we focus on what we see in the reading
        - I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like Farrah said is microscopic
        - I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned
        - That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon
        - You know there's actually very little water really on the moon
        - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text
        - but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,
        - or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth
        - I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye
        - That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it
        - It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water
        - that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?
        - So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,
        - right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it
        - but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water
        - You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it
        - That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters
        - On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope
        - when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size
        - but they didn't they didn't send a microscope up to space okay
        - So in this particular experiment they didn't send that they didn't have people go up
        - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage
        - Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so
        - Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters
        - So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four
        - So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention
        - One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about
- intent: r420.3
  examples: |
        - Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?
        - and we're going to keep our eyes open
        - I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text Luis
        - so, can you look at the text Jazmin and see what the machine does
        - awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay Luis i'm ready for you
        - awesome well Luis I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis
        - At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment
        - So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word
        - So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example Farrah yeah
        - who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that Chris do you have a  question
        - So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, yes
        - Okay guys, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water
        - But let's look back
        - It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something
        - Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage
        - And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment
        - So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable
        - Can everybody look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be
        - So, Chris I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable
        - It's important
        - Can you do that
        - so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable
        - Can you go back in the text and look for specific equipment that they use
        - and maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water
        - So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?
        - Um, how can I say maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use
        - So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,
        - I think the article talks about being able to find water and
        - Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there
        - You have a question
        - So that's one of the great things that we can do, since we're in a class in a learning environment, we can use our skills to reread some articles and we can look back and we can try to find these details if you give me one moment Chris yes def
        - That's okay
        - Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question
        - Once you try it
        - The first thing is to always find evidence in the text
        - And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that
        - Okay, Chris, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and
        - Can someone see what they brought
        - Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate
        - Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it
        - So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six
        - So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question
        - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine
        - When we find,
        - Yeah, the reading and the question
        - You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words
        - And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again
        - So equipment
        - So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read
        - So like this question
        - So go back to all the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,
        - This help discover water on the moon
        - So what equipment
        - Okay, so next time we need to read it again
        - Okay? So we understand clearly what are the tools that they are using and the equipment
        - Can we do that
        - I want you to underline two things and raise your hand
        - Once you're done
        - And if you want to amaze me
        - I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back
        - I want everyone to do that for me
        - So when we find evidence, what do we have to do with that evidence
        - Alright, start thinking about detectives
        - So we have to be detectives
        - There's an "I" word in the article, you find it?
        - But, and so when we have evidence
        - Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with
        - Let's see if you guys can reread and find what
        - So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things
        - And he says,
        - What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together
        - Chris, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water
        - Okay then
        - I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you
        - Go ahead and look back
        - So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that Jazmin aright, Farrah and Oliveron
        - But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it
        - So you keep you look down and you read about the
        - I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does
        - Did you find so in the text
        - Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers
        - But look in your text Jazmin
        - And look, just a few more words
        - What did they call this small machine
        - Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource
        - So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water
        - specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water
        - Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about
        - You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water
        - Something they used
        - Although might have some other knowledge
        - Let's look at specifically at the reading
        - So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for
        - Maybe in one of the headings or sub headings
        - So look back on your article and look for that word valuable
        - Do you see it anywhere in there
        - Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon
        - Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?
        - Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space
        - But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water
        - Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it
        - Would you like to maybe give it another go
        - Scientists found on the moon
        - Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water
        - So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we all to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us
        - Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question
        - Well, I appreciate your honesty
        - So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question
        - So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment
        - Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is
        - What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
        - That is perfect
        - I love that synonym Oliver, you are spot on
        - So if you guys could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools
        - So I see a lot of hands going up
        - I'm going to give everybody a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see
        - Okay, I see some hands going up
        - Chris What equipment or tools did you find in the text?
        - And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon
        - I want you guys to first think about equipment or like Oliver said tools that would be used
        - So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon
        - Those space
        - But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon
        - Oh, we've already get some ideas
        - Helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon
        - Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools
        - Jazmin, what do you see what do you think?
        - So let's look back in the text
        - I want you guys to focus on some key words
        - So I want you guys to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words
        - To find water that's absolutely right
        - That are equipment
        - Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that
        - Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text
        - Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text
        - I want everyone to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph
        - Excellent job
        - Thank you
        - All right, stop right there for me, Luis
        - And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover
        - Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph
        - Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick
        - Why don't the three of you go back together and Underline in the text important things that water can be used for the astronauts can use it for
        - Um, well, Farrah, Oliver and Chris
        - Now that we've kind of talked about the paragraphs that our information is in Jazmin found hers in four Luis found his in five
        - So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage
        - I'll give you about two minutes
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that
        - I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it
        - What is that
        - It tells you what we need to be able to see this
        - And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line
        - Now the next step
        - All right
        - Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question
        - I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question
        - I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important
        - And while each of you had really good thought processes
        - Alright guys so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion
        - So, Luis, if you would
        - And if you don't, what is mentioned
        - Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned
        - So I want you to look for that Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon
        - I want you to find in the text where it talks about the water being so small that you have to use that kind of told hey
        - There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text
        - No if you remember back in the article
        - See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question
        - So let's look at paragraph two, and see what other tool we need
        - So you can talk about your background knowledge
        - I know that you understand what we're talking about
        - Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way
        - But in this particular text
        - So maybe next time
        - We're learning about one specific thing
        - If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay
        - Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me
        - So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them
        - So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water
        - Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question
        - But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place
        - or ask a question if you're confused and um because Farrah also
        - and for your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph
        - To see the exact equipment they used
        - You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used
        - Similar to Chris, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use,
        - If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers
        - So if you guys are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text
        - So for the three of you Farrah Jazmin and Luis when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind
        - And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water
        - so Farrah I want you to go back and look for anything that in the passage that the passage reads not any information that you know from outside just specifically in the passage that water can be valuable to us
        - So um that can be useful useful helpful something any kind of detail
        - But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage
        - So I want you to so as I just said to Farrah and to all of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful
        - drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence
        - Chris what's up
        - Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses
- intent: r130.2
  examples: |
        - awesome awesome okay Farrah and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks
        - Oliver are you are you on board with that
        - now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes Oliver
        - awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon? Yes, Luis
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead Farrah
        - yeah and when you're done why don't you and Luis talk about Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people
        - yeah Farrah and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis
        - So what investigate mean does anybody know
        - So did anybody say like a title?
        - What do astronauts use it for Jazmin
        - is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource Farrah
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and Oliver work together since you were you had the same answer
        - And you can talk about it
        - And I'm going to speak with Chris for a moment
        - Chris, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used
        - And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use
        - Did you circle, those two words
        - Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and Farrah and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope
        - I want you guys to look back at your reading passage
        - and if you finish before I come back to you
        - Go ahead and work on the next question
        - I wonder, maybe Oliver can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer
        - Farrah, would you agree with what Oliver said?
        - So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question
        - So let's talk with Oliver and see if we can work together on that one
        - Let's see if we can figure it out because Oliver had the same answer is you
        - Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to Farrahs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay that's a great question
        - Okay Luis What do you think?
        - Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that
        - Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?
        - Jazmin, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with Chris, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry
        - Okay Luis are you able to help?
        - And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover
        - Luis what did you get
        - Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines
        - But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - You guys look at that together
        - How about Oliver and Farrah
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        - How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer
        - If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three
        - So maybe Chris and Jazmin
        - I think that may help if you reread that okay
        - What do you think, Jazmin, what do you feel about what Luis said?
        - Um, to kind of build off that Oliver
        - Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here
        - But what was the microscope attached to? Help Farrah out
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, Luis, and I appreciate your feedback
        - So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?
        - Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and Oliver, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah
        - Not really, but that's a good guess
        - Chris, what do you got?
        - I'm Question you
        - Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses
        - But we're still missing the point
        - What do you got?
        - Does anyone else have a different response than Jazmin
        - And then why your elbow partner agrees with you
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from Farrah, and why you found what you found
        - Would anyone else like to build on his response
        - I want to see what you two can come up with together
        - Why don't Chris, you talk with Jazmin
        - Jazmin and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer
        - I would like for the four of you, and Luis can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with
        - So, Jazmin was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope
        - So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers
        - To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, Luis Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        - What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you
        - So if you got the right answer
        - And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group
        - What might help your friend
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think Farrah
        - What do you think
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        - Maybe we'll discover it together
        - Let's work together to see if we can find this answer
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together
        - So let me see
        - Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together
        - and let's see class
        - They found craters full of water on the moon
        - Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement
        - so let's see who can add to that
        - So eventually I think should go along with what Oliver said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - So you and Jazmin you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out
        - So you think that you could work with Luis?
        - So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon
        - See if you can look in your text and you and Oliver can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too
        - yes Chris
        - And I'm sure that Farrah and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool
        - Do we agree with her answer
        - What could, Can somebody help Jazmin
        - Did we read about that
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out
        - Can somebody help
        - Farrah, can you help him out there?
        - can anybody or Farrah
        - Can you tell me
        - Does the rest talk with Luis about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        - I think you have the answer
        - So, talk with Luis and help him discover which one it is
        - So, Farrah
        - So what did Chris, you say about the water
        - So then Luis Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon
        - Do you want to answer
        - Luis's question
        - Okay, well let's ask your other classmates
        - So let's break it up into groups Farrah and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and Luis
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - Group members, while the first person is sharing
        - So we're going to start with Farrah, you will be our first person to share
        - You are just listening to them
        - Debbie will be the second Chris, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer
        - And then, Oliver
        - So, Farrah, if you will go first
        - I'll tell you when when to start
        - After that, okay, so you'll share with the group Farrah
        - Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can
        - So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates
        - Also, do you have something else to say
        - Do you agree
        - Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is everybody else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words
        - So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource
        - So, Oliveron Farrah
        - You guys and Chris can work together and Jazmin and Luis You can work together
        - So just paragraph four or five and six
        - Anybody can answer
        - How about Farrah and Oliver show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well
        - That's a claim that Luis said, right Luis?
        - Well, let me, let me ask Jazmin, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine
        - What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help Chris with that one
        - Okay so Luis You know a lot about space
        - Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?
        - So do you guys think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon
        - What did the scientists, fine
        - And so what did that small machine do? Chris, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?
        - Okay, so Chris, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?
        - Does anybody else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts
        - Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with Farrah
        - Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment
        - Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out Luis?
        - So, based on what Luis just read about a lunar orbiter
        - Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver
        - So, do you know what paragraph or
        - But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article
        - So what do you think about this Oliver
        - Did you all hear what I said to Luis?
        - So does anybody else see any other equipment
        - Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to
        - If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer
        - Thumbs up if you agree with Farrah thumbs down
        - What do you think, do you agree with Farrah or no
        - Okay everyone, Oliver
        - Anybody else have a different answer
        - So we're, we're, we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right
        - And then Chris was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter
        - did anybody find a different word than equipment in question one
        - What's another keyword somebody else found
        - Somebody help Chris out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text
        - And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one
        - Convincing what? what are we being convinced of
        - Does anybody have a word to go along with savannas word convincing
        - Yeah so convincing is an important word
        - What is it convincing
        - Also convincing
        - Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment
        - So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space
        - So, Farrah and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and Jazmin, you can talk
        - I would like for you to turn to the person beside you
        - Okay, now that you have circled your keywords
        - And then eighth and you can share your answer with me
        - I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that
        - I want you guys to talk about with that same partner,
        - So, Farrah and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then Luis You can you can talk with me
        - So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi
        - So, Farrah and Deb, you can work together
        - Chris and gel together and Luis You can work with me
        - Okay, so take a couple seconds
        - Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment
        - So you can have what we talked with Farrah, and Oliver here, right, which, if you don't mind
        - So Chris, do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes?
        - Your answer was that NASA send a small machine
        - Does anyone know
        - Does anyone agree or disagree with Oliver
        - You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way
        - Does anyone else have any questions before we begin?
        - Oliver, what you got to add?
        - We're not entirely there just yet
        - Well, we are absolutely on the right track
        - Jazmin, what do you have to add?
        - Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about
        - Okay, well let's see what Chris and Luis thought as well
        - Okay, that's a really good thought
        - Jazmin, would you like to go next
        - I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms
        - And so let's hear from Luis and see what he has to say
        - And we'll come together with a group response
- intent: r110.4
  examples: |
        - that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine
        - nailed it yes Jazmin high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great
        - Totally You got it
        - Equipment is a great word
        - Did anybody else put equipment
        - So that is a great word to underline, did anybody else underline anything else
        - Yes, Farrah
        - So we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good
        - Those are both very important
        - So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?
        - That is exactly right
        - And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Discover, that's great
        - So guys, I want you to think
        - That's absolutely right
        - So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - So good
        - Right, you use it to look at the water
        - Once they found it
        - It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - They did send a small machine
        - Okay, Jazmin, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine
        - Yes, they did
        - Yes, it does
        - You two are correct
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - So you are right there
        - And I'm but yes you are
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - Just those two pieces of equipment
        - Okay, wonderful
        - It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it
        - They did find water on the moon
        - SO let's look there
        - Yeah you Jazmin
        - That is correct
        - That is exactly right
        - That's right
        - That is the small machine
        - I think a lunar orbiter is really key here
        - Without that sort of orbiter right
        - They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon
        - That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and
        - All right, Farrah, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater
        - You did very well
        - That's how they actually examine the water and the craters
        - It's the Lunar Orbiter
        - That is correct
        - Yes, Farrah?
        - They could breathe it
        - Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time
        - Awesome job
        - Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment Jazmin
        - What else
        - Okay, good
        - Yes, you're right
        - So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that
        - Yes, and you need water to survive
        - Yes, you're right
        - Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon
        - Okay? NASA sent a small machine
        - That's right
        - The lunar orbiter
        - You are exactly right
        - And you're right we so we do need that
        - Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        - Yes, those are important as well
        - Oh, and move
        - So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important
        - I know what I mean
        - Good, good, good
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - and you put it out perfectly
        - It could be useful in lots of ways
        - So it could be very important
        - That's exactly right
        - A lunar orbiter
        - So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating
        - So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter
        - Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable
        - Chris you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore
        - You are correct
        - Yes, Jazmin
        - So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment
        - Let me hear from Chris Chris, what were you gonna say
        - OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter
        - So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone
        - Yeah, so that's that's the small machine
        - They sent
        - It's discovering water on the moon
        - A lunar orbiter
        - So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter
        - Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large
        - So they were really small
        - That is excellent
        - Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon
        - Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water
        - That's exactly right
        - Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment
        - Yeah, a lunar orbiter
        - So you're absolutely right
        - No, you're right
        - Farrah that
        - I think you, you're absolutely right
        - It is find water
        - So we can use water as rocket fuel
        - Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel
        - I do believe that that is a correct answer
        - So, good job there,
        - Yes, NASA used a small machine
        - that would also count as a piece of equipment
        - So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said
        - So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine
        - They do need oxygen
        - That is true
        - so Luis you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Very good, very good
        - Mm hmm
        - Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found
        - They actually use that to find it
        - So you're right
        - They do need a small machine and,
        - I just mentioned with Jazmin right that water is heavy
        - Exactly and Chris, you got you got to that part
        - This is the
        - That's what we were looking for
        - Alright, so, Jazmin was back in the story, and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter
        - So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon
        - Alright so next time
        - yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen
        - Alright perfect awesome
        - right there you go Oliveron or Oliver
        - awesome job Jazmin
        - Yes, which you did, so awesome
        - amazing that is just what I was looking for
        - I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um
        - awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for
        - Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome
        - Oliver, yes
        - So that is the equipment
        - Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect
        - I think you've convinced me
        - Yes, that's a great example Oliver, thank you for explaining that to us
        - Yes, that's a great example, thank you Oliver for that
        - Yes, lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, there you go
        - So, that's awesome
        - and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and
        - It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter
        - So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have,
        - So great job
        - The equipment was used to find water on the moon
        - So yes, that is one of the answers to that
        - yeah that is correct
        - I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go
        - So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter
        - That was a perfect response
        - Good job, Luis
        - Great job
        - Great job
        - Great job, Chris
        - Great job, Oliver
        - A lunar orbiter
        - Good job
        - Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon
        - We already had the Lunar orbiter part
        - In the craters
        - To find water on the moon, and because
        - Again Farrah kind of touched on it and her answer
        - To look at the water
        - Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer
        - So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters
        - There you go
        - So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon
        - You're right
        - So you have the lunar
        - Thank you for sharing Chris, so the water was found in this craters
        - Okay, great, great job
        - Yes, you are right
        - So the small machine is the lunar
        - Yeah, your right
        - Your right
        - Yes, you are
        - All right, the lunor orbiter
        - Yes, you are right
        - So the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens
        - Luis So the Lunar Orbiter
        - Nice work, Luis
        - That's exactly right
        - They still had to use it
        - Yes Oliver
        - Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Nice job, Jazmin
        - Good work
        - That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon
        - Yeah, that's absolutely correct
        - So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water
        - Yeah, that's exactly right, Oliver
        - Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom
- intent: r210.4
  examples: |
        - Do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?
        - yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know
        - I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?
        - yeah and what does the machine call
        - tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in
        - And what form so so, is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't
        - What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came
        - That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment, but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right
        - did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water
        - awesome Luis and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.
        - awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon
        - yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that
        - yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do Jazmin what is the machine doing
        - They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it
        - So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right
        - So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called
        - So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together
        - So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you guys want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?
        - Yes, Oliver
        - And while I'm reading, we are looking for
        - We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you
        - So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay
        - So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - If you were looking straight at it
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely
        - So what is that microscope, helping them do guys
        - So what is the name of that machine called?
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So let's look back and see if we can find it
        - Because it's in our passage
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So let's read the sentence
        - But let's look back and see what that's called
        - Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Yes, the small machine
        - Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?
        - Does anyone know what discover means?
        - So you have to find the water before you can look at it right
        - Before we can look at it
        - And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it
        - Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first
        - Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water
        - If we look at number two
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?
        - Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text
        - What equipment did they use?
        - So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and
        - Let's go back into the texts and look
        - It says it in the text
        - If we go back and look
        - In the text
        - Go back and look what's another word that we can use Jazmin
        - All right
        - And what was the name of that machine
        - Yes, a small machine
        - So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use
        - The water on the main for
        - What do astronauts use the water for
        - So why is it a valid valuable
        - But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source
        - So resource
        - What does it say
        - All right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater
        - I think right?
        - Yes, and that's where they found it
        - That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits
        - So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters
        - I guess it was really cold the
        - It landed on the moon South Pole
        - So tell me, just reading our passage Jazmin
        - Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment
        - So you underlined equipment and discover
        - Did the scientists discover water on the moon with
        - but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small
        - So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there
        - Yes Oliver
        - We also read in paragraph three
        - That word could that's in the second sentence
        - Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways
        - So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful
        - And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?
        - Let's stop for a second
        - Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?
        - Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?
        - Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it
        - Okay that is moisture
        - But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon
        - We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that
        - Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink
        - In paragraph three, what does it say about
        - When, when it says we're not able to see it
        - What does it say right after that
        - Can't wait
        - So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that
        - We can see that there's something in our glass
        - So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here
        - Do you know have you turned before naked eye
        - We can't see it with our naked eye
        - Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater
        - So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small
        - So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that
        - Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water
        - Did it say that it was there
        - So they can be found
        - But this passage was only talking about
        - So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen
        - What they found on the moon
        - The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want all of you to look in paragraph three
        - What does it say about the water in paragraph three
        - So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see
        - If you look in paragraph to
        - The fourth sentence
        - Can you look down at the four sentence
        - My cup right here is 30 ounces
        - Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which
        - I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass
        - so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find
        - NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine
        - Okay, and Jazmin, you are correct
        - Did anybody see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph
        - A lunar orbiter is doing a different job
        - They called a lunar orbiter to what?
        - Did they discover water with the microscope?
        - Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second
        - They didn't talk to anyone on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues
        - So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues
        - And what did they find with the lunar orbiter
        - Discovering orbiting, looking around
        - Used to investigate
        - A lunar orbiter
        - Jazmin remind me what investigating means again
        - Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon
        - They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water Farrah
        - Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water
        - Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading
        - Was there any other equipment that they've talked about
        - What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope
        - What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?
        - They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called
        - And you are exactly right
        - Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called
        - How many of you guys were looking for the word water in the in the passage
        - So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water
        - So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, Jazmin?
        - And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small
        - So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there
        - So let's look back in the text
        - Now let's go back and look at that text
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So it is asking in the text field like back in the text
        - There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right
        - So do you think the microscope to help them
        - Look for water while they're physically on the moon
        - So if you look in the text
        - This is it
        - They use the lunar orbiter right
        - And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water
        - See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon
        - So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment
        - They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water
        - And then we're looking for what?
        - Well, they were looking for water on the moon
        - And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water
        - So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer
        - and, let me read this, um, you said, it, Luis, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?
        - Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely
        - What do you think that they need to look things really closely
        - Yes, that's amazing
        - So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small
        - For example, why do you think that they you a microscope
        - If you read the text again
        - Let's get even a little more basic there
        - So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?
        - Very good, very good
        - I'm glad you're seeing it
        - So let's take a look back, Oliver noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us
        - So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,
        - What makes it very interesting to read
        - But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory
        - While there is some water there
        - It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water
        - Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes
        - So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right
        - So we know that they're kind of the subject
        - They're kind of who this article was talking about, right
        - And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon
        - But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters
        - Once you take a quick glance at it
        - what did they find these with
        - But what is the text tell you about it
        - And what's the small machine called
        - That is correct
        - Okay, NASA send a small machine
- intent: r210.3
  examples: |
        - Farrah and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first
        - but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one
        - awesome so Jazmin how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information
        - Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope Farrah
        - Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment Chris Chris does your answer mentioned equipment
        - We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis
        - My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon
        - So Oliver if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence
        - But let's look at our discussion question
        - You're right you did talk about the water
        - Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?
        - Need you to narrow down your answer more specific
        - Okay, Farrah, which what, what, where did you circle or words
        - Did what important word or words did you circle in the question
        - And they do use that, but I'm just like with Chris
        - I asked him, did they use that to discover the water
        - How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters
        - When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us
        - Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future
        - But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon
        - Yeah, which that really isn't telling us
        - What the machine was right
        - Luis Did you find anything was talking about oxygen
        - Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?
        - And I think Luis That you had told us about oxygen tanks
        - Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else
        - Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon
        - Luis Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question
        - So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?
        - Do you think--
        - And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?
        - And she said, NASA send a small machine
        - Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer
        - What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?
        - Couldn't it?
        - Bus a small machine that could be anything
        - So what else could you put in your answer?
        - Do you know what the small machine was called?
        - It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade Farrah
        - As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that
        - So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but
        - Improvement and tell me what changes
        - Did you make
        - Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine
        - Um, depending on size
        - How do you feel about your answer
        - I think a Farrah
        - What might you say instead
        - Just to kind of circle back a little bit
        - Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there
        - If you were giving it another shot at it
        - Now, what was the microscope attached to?
        - You didn't actually name the machine, right
        - Does that answer the question
        - So if you look into your statement
        - So that's going to be very valuable
        - So what else can be valuable there
        - It talks about in there
        - How are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it
        - What else, what other purposes
        - Does this takes point two for that answer
        - Right, so it can be used for what else
        - And they have, what do you know, there's one more
        - I think
        - Very much and Farrah
        - There's one more
        - But did the microscope actually find the water?
        - So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable
        - Did you hear that somewhere else
        - So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen
        - Is there any other words that are important
        - Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at our question again and see if that answers
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So it's good
        - But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable
        - It says it's good
        - I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information
        - Um, so do you
        - What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think
        - Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use
        - We want to learn more
        - Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon
        - But we're we're expanding our thinking
        - What could we do to improve that response
        - Improve that in response
        - Can anybody else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water
        - Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?
        - But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope
        - Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?
        - But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?
        - But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?
        - Or is there a better answer?
        - There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?
        - Does anyone know
        - However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?
        - Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?
        - But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?
        - They use a lot of equipment
        - While that's true, is that what they used?
        - And just like Luis, he had mentioned some as well
        - So does that say that that's what NASA sent though Farrah?
        - Guys, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - But does that say, that's what they sent
        - So they used, how can we
        - How could we restate this question
        - How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a
        - What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about
        - How could we restate that question
        - Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or
        - Let's see, let me think about that
        - Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while
        - How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while
        - Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about
        - Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important
        - Yes, Jazmin
        - Now try to think about that next time
        - Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space
        - Does that tell us
        - But it just says that they found evidence that there was water
        - Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there
        - Does that mean that there's a lot?
        - Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?
        - But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon
        - So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water
        - They use it to examine the water
        - Yet, that's right
        - So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it
        - Okay, water could be one
        - Do you see any other words that could be important
        - But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource
        - So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and Oliver
        - I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not
        - So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything
        - No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon
        - Moving forward, this could be very valuable
        - So what does the oxygen tank do Luis
        - And one way
        - astronauts could do what with the water
        - But if there was water on the moon, but that help us
        - But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon
        - And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall
        - Do you need water to live on Earth
        - But let's say for example the do you need
        - But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me
        - They might actually help out astronauts?
        - This can anybody does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon
        - Is there enough evidence
        - But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future
        - You know, you know, at least going forward
        - If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there
        - Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific
        - Okay, so when we answer something
        - That way there's no confusion
        - So you, how do you think if we took your answer
        - They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about
        - So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?
        - That we need to expand upon some of the answers
        - And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope
        - What did it show us
        - So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water
        - And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you
        - I'm gonna say Jazmin
        - It's, you just need to support it
        - No, it's not
        - So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon Farrah?
        - So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment
        - Let's look at back at some of our answers
        - So I see that we have
        - Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage
        - So, Jazmin that you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment
        - Did you find
        - In why microscope wasn't the best choice
        - because the microscope was a tool
        - In fact, so
        - So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool
        - But how did they discover it or another word
        - How did they find that water
        - So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - Right? So the microscope does help us see the water
        - But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place
        - So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right
        - My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split
        - What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you
        - But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon
        - Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today
        - Oh, Farrah, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down
        - It says that the whole time throughout the article
        - Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water
        - So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - That is very true
        - Did people go up on the moon, though
        - Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read
        - Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article
        - Is there a title of that machine
        - Is there a name of that machine in number two?
        - That is true
- intent: r120.4
  examples: |
        - So let's see Chris what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share Their answer and what they were thinking
        - yeah so Luis What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me
        - hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from Farrah all the way down to Luis from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question
        - Farrah repeat for me what your answer was, real quick
        - Great Thank you
        - and you Oliver?
        - Nice and Jazmin
        - Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle
        - Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is
        - Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?
        - Okay, so what's your answer?
        - Luis, what do you think?
        - Chris did you find the answer
        - nd first I'd like to address Farrah Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us
        - Okay, Chris, would you like to read your answer
        - Okay, and Jazmin, would you like to read us your answer
        - and Luis that would you like to read as your answer
        - Okay Luis What do you think
        - So let's talk about some of your answers
        - Would one of you like to volunteer your answer
        - Can we start with your answer
        - Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer
        - I wanted to just Farrah
        - If you remind me of your answer
        - Chris was that you
        - Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea
        - What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer
        - Did you guys circle, a word
        - Who would like to tell me what word they circled
        - Did you circle in your question
        - What word
        - Farrah, let's start with you
        - How about you, Chris
        - Can someone tell me what two words that they circled
        - So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage
        - Chris, what did you underline or circle
        - Okay, Farrah, you know, what did you underline or circle
        - All right
        - Then what did you underline or circle
        - Would you remind me of what you had told me before
        - Can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading
        - So I'd like to start with Farrah
        - Maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading
        - So, um, I want to know from you all
        - What about you, was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading
        - What about you, is there something really interesting about the reading
        - And, um, Chris
        - Thank you for raising your hand, would you like to share something interesting about the reading
        - Luis You said you knew a lot about science
        - Was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you
        - Okay I saw savannas hand first
        - What do you think, Farrah
        - Chris, do you have something you'd like to add
        - I'm sorry, Jazmin, what was that?
        - Do you remember put for that?
        - What did you put?
        - All right, do you have anything else you want to add?
        - Say that one more time
        - Um, what, what did you correct it to what did you write down again
        - And let's just see what you guys got Farrah
        - Did you find one
        - Did you get the chance to revise yours?
        - Um, and then Oliver
        - Would you remind me of your answer again
        - I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
        - Can you repeat that?
        - So who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment
        - Was it informative for you?
        - What do you think about the reading
        - What do you think about the article Oliver?
        - Was it interesting for you?
        - Will you like to do that
        - Farrah, what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today?
        - Thanks for raising your hands there
        - What equipment do you think that they use
        - What do you think Jazmin? What equipment did they use?
        - What equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so, Farrah
        - What was your answer
        - Let's see
        - You know all about space
        - So even if I remember correctly, you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And so what was your response to this
        - Very good, thank you
        - Thank you for that understanding today so Chris, I'd like to hear your response
        - Chris, I might have dismiss heard you
        - Could you repeat your response for me, word for word just an I make sure I
        - So, uh, and I'm so sorry
        - What was your answer to the question number one
        - So Farrah, let's start with you
        - Ah, say that statement
        - One more time
        - Okay, so now let's look at your statement
        - Now once you read your statement again
        - Okay, so what is
        - What do you think about the answer to the question is
        - Once you read that to go back to Chris Chris
        - Also, let's hear
        - Jazmin, what was your answer to this question
        - So, Jazmin, what you got
        - I just say it might be some improvement there
        - Say it's not a good answer
        - What was your answer
        - Well he's reading that
        - What was your answer
        - Did you guys did you have any luck, searching for more stuff over there
        - You just said it does know what was your answer
        - Luis What's another use
        - Jazmin, I would like to hear from you
        - Yes, Luis?
        - Let's look at your answer that you gave
        - How did you answer the question again?
        - Luis Luis What did you want to ask first,
        - Okay, so what did you your
        - And what did you want to add to that
        - Okay, I'm sorry, Chris, what did you want to add to that
        - Okay, so what was your response Luis?
        - Tell me what your answer was, again,
        - So your answer
        - Jazmin, what do you think
        - So do you think water could be useful
        - What do you think, do you think water could be valuable from the moon
        - What do you think
        - What do you think
        - Let's look back to your answer you answered
        - Okay, that's two of the key words Jazmin, you can maybe you can give us another one
        - How about Farrah
        - All right, Deb, is there a different word that you found
        - So Luis Can you remind you what was your answer for this question
        - Can you tell me what your answer was, again,
        - Can you tell me what your answer was
        - can you remind me, Jazmin, what was your answer to this question
        - Um, Farrah what was your answer to this one
        - Okay guys, so let's go ahead and review your answers
        - Can you repeat your answer for me
        - So, Luis I noticed that you when you answered
        - Well, let's review some answers
        - And then we'll see about that
        - Okay, I'm gonna while you look, I'm going to go to Jazmin and look at Jazmin's answer so Jazmin
        - Can you repeat your answer for me, please
        - Can you repeat your answer for me
        - Um, can you repeat your answer for me
        - So can you read your response
        - One more time Farrah a please
        - Okay, so, Luis, did you discover how to, did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - So how did scientists discover water on the moon
        - Okay, well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today
        - Jazmin, do you remember the name
        - All right before our little time is up and we need a good clear, concise answer
        - Anyone have one that they would like to share?
        - Your answer was what?
        - Now, Oliver, could you talk to us about your answer?
        - Okay, Farrah, can you please, um,
        - What was your response
        - Can you share with your friends
        - Jazmin why don't you share with us
        - So who would like to share something that they underlined
        - Thank you, Luis, and Jazmin
        - Chris, what did you underline
        - So what did you say for your answer?
        - You're right, Farrah
        - So what did they send to investigate the moon's craters?
        - I know you guys had already submitted me some questions
        - So let's see
        - Sounds good
        - Let me see
        - Farrah, can you talk about your question a little bit? Your answer that you gave me
        - Thank you
        - And so can you guys show me your responses to the first question
        - Luis I'll need your help
        - So, um, let's see, Farrah
        - Were you the one that talked about
        - The microscope premier
        - Okay, so can you read me your answer
        - I can't see him
        - Again, sometimes it's hard to keep up with so many
        - Tell me what
        - While you're thinking, I'm going to answer, guys
        - My question, what did you need Jazmin, what was your question
        - Did you find something else
        - So did you
        - So, Farrah
        - So, I think, paragraph two, is really important
        - I asked you to do something
        - All right, Jazmin
        - Have you talked it out
        - Okay, so tell me what you got
        - Okay, so let's go over some of our answers Farrah
        - Do you want to give your answer
        - Oliver would you like to give your answer to the reading into the question
        - Can you tell us what you think the answer is, and what you found in the text
        - Jazmin, what did you find in the text
        - Then what did you find out that NASA used?
        - I bet you really enjoyed this reading
        - and then Luis You said that you knew a lot about space
        - Oliver, what did you see why you were reading
        - Read your story
        - How about you, why you read
        - What did you find
        - What did you circle, Luis
- intent: r220.1
  examples: |
        - Hello um I think these are all really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so Can I get a yes
        - I think we all have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text
        - Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to OK, so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us To understand a little bit what we're reading, but we specifically also want to look for evidence right
        - The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this group is I want you to think what is this question asking
        - what what does it mean to circle evidence
        - yeah Luis
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - So what is an ice deposit
        - And we had some really great responses
        - So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text
        - But in a text
        - It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - Well, we're gonna learn some more
        - I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about
        - Thank you for joining me at the small group table, guys
        - Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon
        - I want
        - And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have
        - I just want you guys to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage
        - But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question
        - Hey everybody, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer
        - Luis What's going on
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        - I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me
        - Again, Luis
        - Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer
        - But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer
        - Oh yes, Luis
        - And I wanted to kind of dive into these here
        - I want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent
        - And I'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about it
        - So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article
        - Now we got to read about something really cool
        - To get more specific with our response
        - Not just one person answering okay
        - Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort
        - We are just diving deeper into the text as a team, so that everyone is on the same page
        - Who knows, have a strategy that we can use
        - So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question
        - That's what we're going to do
        - So let's take a look at your answers
        - And so in this case
        - Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space
        - And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that
        - So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more
        - Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion
        - So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were
        - And the, the question
        - Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough
        - Okay? Do you know what thorough is?
        - We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions
        - So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses
        - Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our
        - Writing that is going to help us connect and learn
        - I want
        - We want to see the process of how are we going to
        - Can we do that
        - Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response
        - So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about
        - All right, great
        - Okay, so what was our question
        - Can someone read that for me
        - So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text
        - So here's what we're gonna do, guys
        - We're going to go through each of your responses
        - Okay, so let's look at your response
        - Okay, so let's look back at Farrah answer real quick
        - First, what did you say
        - Does that sound good to you guys
        - So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you guys about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage
        - we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon
        - So remember the discussion question is-- yes Luis?
        - All right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer
        - Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know all about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about
        - I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it
        - So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff
        - I didn't even know about water on the moon
        - So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this group
        - So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers
        - But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions
        - So I want you all to look at question number two
        - Yeah, wonderful, buddy
        - Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on
        - So I suppose I will start with
        - So that's the main goal of what we're working on together
        - extracting information from from informative text
        - Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the group can learn from
        - So work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those
        - A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small group is to kind of build off those responses
        - So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better
        - Does that make sense?
        - So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon
        - And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you just raise your hand
        - I'll call on you
        - So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you
        - And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work
        - So what we can do is just kind of go around the room
        - But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting
        - So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good
        - But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question
        - Well, I hope you're right
        - Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a group to kind of share our knowledge with each other
        - Because we're not just
        - So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer
        - I saw bits and pieces of that in there
        - Yes, Luis?
        - Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers
        - It's good to see you too
        - Yes, Luis?
        - So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer
        - You're talking about space
        - Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon
        - So the reason why we're looking back over your answers
        - but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that y'all
        - Write down for your answers
        - You guys put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is
        - Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so
        - And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence
        - Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer
        - I do like that you what you changed your answer to
        - And we're going to hang out
        - We're going to help other people in this group use that same thought process
        - And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer
        - Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer
        - We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give
        - Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords
        - Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this group
        - So today I want us to work on finding
        - keywords in questions to help us better answer questions
        - So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer
        - We're all going to be in the group to learn together and discuss what we read
        - We're just having a group discussion now that we've read
        - Okay well we're all put in this group to help each other learn, um,
        - And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out
        - Sound like a plan?
        - So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together
        - But we're not all quite there just yet
        - I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell all of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time
        - One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes
        - That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class
        - And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your group discussion
        - Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one group
        - And I want to make sure that everybody has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water
        - Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon
        - You might find something that you didn't know
        - Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today
        - The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you guys
        - No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you guys got your answers from
        - Well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it
        - For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text
        - Does that sound good
        - So for this group, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading
        - tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you guys to use examples exactly from the text that way
        - I know that you guys had an easy time reading
        - Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do
        - It sounds good to you, Luis?
        - good to hear so today I put you on a group because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon
        - and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon
        - There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Jazmin
        - Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you guys will be time to write down your answers to questions
        - Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small group, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer
        - Yes Luis
        - So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes Luis
        - So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you
        - So, Farrah to start
        - So I think you guys all did a really great job thinking while using our text
        - I know that you know all about space
        - It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts
        - But this isn't about learning about space
        - Does that makes sense?
        - So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text
        - Yes Luis
        - So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them
        - You may know all about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages
        - So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you guys can better understand
        - How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage
        - So I want one-- yes, Luis
        - So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did everyone read? Yes, OK
        - So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding
        - So we're going to try to fix that today
        - hi everyone so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So first before we share our answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question
        - Everyone had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects
        - Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better
        - Maybe you guys do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text
        - So I think so
        - In from the reading
        - However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material
        - So this really helpful
        - I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills
        - That can be true, however, today we're using science
        - to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about
        - As you guys have done we're going to be using that reading
        - and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions
        - And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills
        - So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science
        - But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills
        - And how we work to break down questions and such um
        - I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language
- intent: r230.2
  examples: |
        - Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes Farrah
        - So Farrah can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say
        - yeah so Jazmin can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that
        - Yes, you do
        - But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her
        - Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different
        - Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made
        - Farrah based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing
        - And what makes you think that way
        - Luis Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says
        - Where did you find evidence that
        - The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Can you tell me where what you found
        - Does that tell us that that happened
        - What paragraph
        - You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Uh huh
        - Let's talk about your answer
        - Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks
        - Yes, yes
        - That's right, good job
        - Can you tell me what paragraph you found
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Did you find that answer in the in the text?
        - Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as Farrah but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because
        - Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what Chris had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing
        - Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?
        - Oliver, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question
        - If you will refer back to your article back to your reading
        - I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water Jazmin, I see your hand up
        - So, Jazmin, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water
        - Okay, Farrah does Jazmin answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three
        - Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?
        - So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find
        - Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in
        - Perfect and Jazmin
        - So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though
        - So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely
        - Well, let's think about it this way, Jazmin, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?
        - Where did you read that in the text
        - So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used Farrah, let's start with you
        - I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech
        - What evidence did you use
        - Chris, what evidence did you circle
        - Jazmin, what evidence did you circle to help you answer
        - Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you
        - Luis What evidence
        - And I want to hear from Luis really quickly
        - What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope
        - Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope
        - And Oliver, what happened
        - How did they study that the small ice deposits
        - Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is
        - Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?
        - Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope
        - So what do you guys think about that
        - Where is the evidence that might help you with this question
        - Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called
        - Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?
        - And we also read in the paragraphs
        - What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools
        - And what else did you, did you read
        - So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?
        - Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water
        - Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?
        - So, I see deposits are very small
        - So it's using the equipment to do what?
        - So did they use the microscope to discover the water?
        - Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that
        - Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence
        - And what are we using to investigate our evidence?
        - So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five
        - Can we look back for some details? Chris
        - So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?
        - But does it mention that in the paragraphs?
        - So you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1
        - What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence
        - Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy
        - So read that sentence again for me
        - So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at
        - What is this, what was the small machine called
        - So what did this machine, do
        - And so you said they sent this machine
        - Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?
        - How much water did they find
        - Um you so talk to me about that
        - So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?
        - But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags
        - What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?
        - But what does it tell us in the story?
        - Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks
        - Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water
        - Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?
        - So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically
        - do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming
        - Okay, so let's
        - Did you circle in the text
        - Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence
        - You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence
        - Did you circle
        - Okay, well what paragraph
        - Do you think we can find that in
        - How did you find that answer
        - And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer
        - But what are we looking closely for?
        - Alright, so let's go look
        - Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there
        - What did it send the small machine to do?
        - So you talked about NASA sending a small machine
        - If we look back at the text
        - What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used
        - Teacher:But what equipment do you think they used to find it
        - And, but let's
        - Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?
        - And what does that lunar orbiter do?
        - To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?
        - And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things
        - and Oliver, is that where you found your evidence as well?
        - And so that's very good, Farrah
        - And where did you see that at?
        - Okay, they sent a small machine
        - What did it do?
        - That's one type of equipment
        - What else did they do with the equipment
        - Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article
        - Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine
        - Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included
        - I want you guys to take a second to locate
        - In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you guys to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope
        - Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well
        - So So Deb
        - Let's look at microscope
        - Did you find where we can find microscope and and there
        - Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?
        - Yeah, and Farrah
        - Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?
        - No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence
        - What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen
        - How are they going to use the hydrogen?
        - Where did you get your answer from, Chris
        - Where did you find your answer?
        - So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage
        - What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage
        - Farrah, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?
        - Luis You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks
        - What are they using that for
        - Did you look back in the text using your keywords
        - I'm so how did you find that answer
        - So I want everyone to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer
        - Where did you find in the text to support your answer
        - And Jazmin, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer
        - Why did you underline that in paragraph two
        - And so, Farrah
        - Oliver why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,
        - Luis Where did you come up with your answer
        - and Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story
        - In fact, everybody look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person
        - Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion
        - What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope
        - Now, do me a favor
        - Have you found it
        - To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage
        - Help me understand what led you to your conclusion
        - Do me a favor, go back into the text
        - Did you find the information about the crater
        - Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph
        - So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking
        - Help me, help me with yours
        - I asked you to find where you found your information in the text
        - Where'd you see it
        - And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine
        - Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text
        - Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?
        - They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for
        - Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss Jazmin, and you said that they sent a small machine
        - Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?
        - Could you share with the class The section that mentioned this tool
        - Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?
        - Okay um so what in the text makes you think that
        - Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?
        - Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to
        - Using a microscope as a piece of equipment
        - Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine
        - No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin
        - And you talked about that NASA send something
        - So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question Luis
        - The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,
        - so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text
        - Thank you alright Jazmin so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text
        - All right, awesome Thank you alright Chris, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat
        - All right, thank you so Farrah where did you find your answer in the text
        - let's see where where did you find that in the text
        - yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us
        - Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay
        - and just a second the Oliver can you find where the microscope is in text
        - awesome alright so Oliver where did you find the information about microscope and the text
- intent: r230.3
  examples: |
        - So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome
        - yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different
        - So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it
        - So Farrah and Oliver, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together
        - and Chris i'll be with you in just a second
        - Oh okay Jazmin You said something like that didn't you
        - and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this
        - so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right
        - But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you guys sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers
        - Oliver yeah
        - They can use what's on the man
        - That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there
        - Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water
        - And also, Chris was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it
        - Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel
        - From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there
        - Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, back to Farrah
        - So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well
        - You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as Farrah
        - It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment
        - You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space
        - Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment
        - So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks
        - I appreciate that
        - I do agree with you
        - We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but
        - That we haven't seen it yet
        - And so, carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,
        - Am I correct Chris is that you're thinking
        - Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon
        - We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead
        - And that would make it valuable to us
        - You said that you use the microscope to look closely
        - I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - He said he thought it was in paragraph three
        - Okay, so, Jazmin just gave us an excellent answer
        - She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from Oliver
        - Thank you for raising your hand so Farrah thought it was in paragraph three, and Jazmin thought it was in paragraph two,
        - Um, you said using a small machine, Luis
        - You did correct your answer, but your answer
        - And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter
        - She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Perfect so answering that Jazmin answered it perfectly
        - You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more
        - Yes, that would be an option to maybe Luis Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read
        - So, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - And that's true
        - Let's take care of that
        - Let's then switch track
        - Let's see here
        - All right
        - So let's take a look right now
        - You got it all figured out
        - We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Luis I'm excited to hear
        - So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there
        - You talk about a to look really close
        - Your answer isn't ready yet
        - It's not ready yet
        - To us yet
        - So you said the water is not ready to eat
        - Is that what you're trying to say
        - So I just wanted to clarify that
        - I can't remember who said it but you have saving way
        - I think it was Chris right
        - So are all these things we just talked about that have value
        - Right, are all of these things, able to be done with water
        - Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes
        - So these are all the things that you should listen
        - So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked
        - All of these are good pieces of information from our passage
        - At the craters on the moon and Jazmin was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine
        - So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found Chris, what did you want to add
        - Did they use to discover
        - Okay, what equipment
        - She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things
        - So Farrah is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon
        - So Oliver also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage
        - Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship
        - So that is very good thinking,
        - That is very true
        - They could have room for other things
        - Yes, water is heavy
        - Machine was sent to investigate
        - Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space
        - So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space
        - Does that make sense?
        - Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water
        - And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet
        - I'm jab and Farrah you both wrote no to this answer
        - Jazmin has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and
        - And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink
        - Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,
        - Yeah, they did
        - They need a lot of tools
        - They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen
        - Yes, and you are exactly right
        - They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon
        - You guys said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable
        - So I see that Oliver and Farrah
        - Yes, and I completely agree
        - And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but
        - It will take a long time
        - You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - You definitely can't
        - Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer
        - That is very true
        - So it is very valuable to have the water
        - And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - Also see where Chris, he added, kind of onto your answer
        - So we need oxygen
        - I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space
        - NASA sent a small machine
        - They said that they wanted a microscope
        - Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that Oliver?
        - So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely
        - So let's go ahead and get into those answers
        - Okay, well that's perfect Farrah
        - So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important
        - Let's see, Farrah and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true
        - Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else Jazmin?
        - Um, let's see
        - So those are very important things
        - You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Luis You said water can be
        - See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture
        - So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct
        - Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there
        - So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat
        - Okay, so
        - Right, so that
        - So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now
        - Um, so, Farrah, you said not for a long time
        - read what you wrote your class
        - Is that right, is that what you meant by that
        - Why it's going to take a long time
        - So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now
        - That is exactly right
        - We do need water to survive
        - And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said
        - The astronauts
        - You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - You can't survive without water
        - You said water is is heavy
        - So it's good
        - Yeah, I was trying to get to that
        - So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there
        - They don't have to carry it and ships anymore
        - That's good
        - Okay, so let's let's think about your answer
        - So you said they use Microsoft's correct
        - Is that right,
        - Oliver, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm Farrah
        - But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer
        - You said that you could
        - Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there
        - When you said that
        - So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph
        - And I, I want to ask another question
        - Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle
        - Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks
        - I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Alright so Miss Farrah
        - Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs
        - There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable
        - So you are right in the fact that it is heavy
        - And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource
        - It takes up a lot of room
        - Okay, well, we'll go over yours too
        - So you mentioned a small machine
        - Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water
        - I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well
        - And I agree with you, Jazmin
        - So the two verbs here where
        - Discover and equipment
        - Okay, so let's take about
        - Farrah and Oliver, both of y'all kind of said no it's not ready
        - There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time
        - So it's good
        - And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy
        - They don't have to curate in the ships anymore
        - So I guess with your answer
        - They found water
        - That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so
        - You're kind of saying that it's important
        - And so, Farrah, you've mentioned that it will be a long time
        - It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water
        - In other words, it's not available right away
        - Yeah, and that's certainly very true
        - Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important
        - Astronauts have to carry it in space
        - That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry Chris
        - And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now
        - But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable
        - So that's very useful
- intent: r110.2
  examples: |
        - Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        - You're all right
        - It is, I didn't say it was wrong
        - The only person Jazmin is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable
        - Um, we definitely need oxygen
        - When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here
        - Your, your answer is not wrong
        - You need a microscope to be able
        - To see it
        - You could if there's enough water
        - That is true
        - Well, Jazmin, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct
        - Farrah I want to go back to your answer
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And that is very, very true,
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water,
        - I like the connection you made there
        - All right
        - I'm so glad that you could clarify
        - That's great
        - Thank you
        - So you weren't wrong at all
        - They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water
        - They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here
        - Good job
        - So you said
        - Your answer isn't wrong
        - You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question
        - They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?
        - That's a good connection Chris
        - Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you guys read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right
        - Good job
        - Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely
        - So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - You're right about that
        - So, it is a small machine that is correct
        - So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space
        - You are correct
        - And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out
        - And I did
        - Awesome job
        - And Jazmin once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well
        - So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text
        - And that is correct
        - That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts Chris
        - I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text
        - Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon
        - So, you are right
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - That's a very good answer
        - Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water
        - So yes, that's something really good to add Chris
        - Thank you
        - And I see it's the microscope
        - Very good, very good
        - Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        - You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this
        - And I think Chris did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that
        - Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon
        - It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so Chris talk
        - Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading
        - Now, they discovered the water
        - You got that right on the nose
        - I would say that a lot better answers the question
        - And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect
        - We might include how those
        - So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        - I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there
        - You got a lot closer there
        - That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right
        - What is that small machine called
        - A small machine, right, perfect
        - So, which is a good thing
        - So you're both right
        - That's great about working in groups
        - We all participate and contribute
        - You just didn't have the--
        - Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and Farrah good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours
        - So you're both right
        - So they did using what they,
        - I liked your answers
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air
        - And if you don't have the heavy water
        - Okay, and Jazmin
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - Your answer was never wrong Jazmin's original answer was that scientist
        - So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong
        - You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - That's a very good point
        - And they did
        - I would like to see if Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Oh, that would be awesome
        - That is very good thinking
        - Yes, that is correct
        - And no one's answer is wrong
        - Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further
        - So, Farrah
        - Well, it's not wrong
        - but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question
        - And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes
        - but you guys were right there at it so so
        - Did you know the name of this orbiter?
        - That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before
        - I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks
        - Yeah a lot
        - So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe
        - Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space
        - So that was one equipment that they did use
        - There's not a lot of oxygen
        - Well, that was right too
        - Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something
        - We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but
        - So I mean he's not wrong,
        - Okay, Chris
        - Okay, thank you
        - Okay, they use several types of of of equipment
        - Okay, I am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong
        - Your everybody's answer is
        - Your answer is very right they did use a microscope
        - Let's figure answers Farrah, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely
        - That is equipment, you're correct
        - They have to use all those things before they can start their explorations
        - That is right Chris
        - We're getting a little bit off topic here, but Luis you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that
        - It would and it would be really useful too
        - Luis What about you
        - So it might not be worked at
        - But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money
        - I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words
        - So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?
        - We're just wanting to find kind of even more
        - No, your answer isn't wrong
        - OK? About it
        - Oh, I didn't say that
        - So they sent mall machine
        - You're exactly right
        - That's the tool that we're looking for
        - That's right
        - That's very good
        - That's right
        - I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer
        - That is correct
        - And it does say that, um, does it
        - So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?
        - Yes, it was the microscope
        - Does everybody see where Farrah found that in paragraph three?
        - Good job, Jazmin
        - Did everybody hear that while Luis was reading
        - That was a wonderful answer
        - Does anyone else want to add their answer to it
        - Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool
        - Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as
        - Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong
        - Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong
        - Your answer is not wrong, Jazmin
        - Well, I don't think that you're wrong
        - A small machine
        - And so it's not that your answer is incorrect,
        - So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon,
        - Your answer is correct
        - Correct they did have to use the equipment so Luis and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters
        - I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means
        - So you answer that that NASA send a small machine
        - Maybe your answer is right
        - And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there
        - I didn't say your answer was wrong
        - So your answer was right
        - That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine
        - It's not that your answers are wrong
        - Right, so they
        - Those are different types of equipment that scientists use
        - So you guys are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water
        - You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean
        - Good job
        - You did a great job with with understanding what water is even
        - How can it be valuable for us on the moon
        - Those are great job, guys
        - Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake
        - Thank you
        - And that is a great answer
        - I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct
        - Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon
        - So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon
        - But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon
        - Yes, Farrah
        - just like Luis brought up about space
        - He knows this is not just about equipment but about space
        - He's looking into it
        - When I looked over your answer
        - It wasn't that it wasn't wrong
        - It is what it is
        - There was some great points you brought about it
        - So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate Jazmin, you said it again?
- intent: r230.1
  examples: |
        - i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer
        - Luis why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said
        - All right, Jazmin, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine
        - would be, can you tell me more about this small machine does
        - Farrah, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did
        - Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is Farrah, can you tell me why you put that answer as well
        - yeah so Chris you're right Those are all great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer
        - All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers Chris, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer
        - Farrah and Oliver you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer
        - say more, why is it the answer to the question Oliver
        - Farrah was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different
        - And does anyone know
        - Can someone tell me what discover means?
        - That is absolutely correct
        - We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words
        - And what are those two different things
        - What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson
        - And then we'll talk about the answer
        - Why are you confused
        - So did you say you have a new answer
        - Oliver and were you a person who said no
        - Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind
        - Why would a microscope, help us see the water
        - Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small
        - Can you tell me more?
        - Aside from the question itself
        - Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting
        - Is that what you said
        - You didn't find that in the reading
        - Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?
        - Hey, Oliver can you tell me a little bit more why you like Farrahs answer
        - All right
        - I like the connection you made there
        - Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?
        - Thank you so much for reading
        - So, Chris, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?
        - Why did you write down the answer that you did
        - OK, and Oliver why did you, why did you put down the same thing in Farrah was your mind going the same way as hers?
        - I saw where Farrah
        - What made you change your answer
        - Where you revised your answer
        - what made you change your mind
        - What made you change your answer?
        - Okay, Chris and you revised you're in
        - Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that
        - So you put that the water
        - What made you change to change your answer
        - What did you change your answer to
        - You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice
        - Can you list off some equipment that they used
        - So I'd like to start with Farrah
        - What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there
        - So let's hear your answer
        - And how do you think you got to that answer
        - You could give me one moment, Jazmin, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on
        - Jazmin, absolutely you can
        - What were you looking for?
        - Well, let's look at what made you think of that
        - And what led you that answer
        - And how did you gather that information
        - Did you read our passage
        - And Farrah then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah
        - Will you tell me where you found your answer
        - What do you think
        - Luis What are you thinking
        - Okay, so let's talk about that
        - Jazmin, did, why did you answer your question by using, by saying the words
        - What made you say that
        - Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can
        - Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water
        - Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water
        - Yes, Oliver?
        - She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small
        - Yes, that is what they sent
        - And Chris, what did they investigate when they got there?
        - What would that be valuable
        - So why did you guys think that what was your opinion about that
        - Like, how did you come up with your answer
        - Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the group
        - All right, Farrah
        - I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and Oliver try and explain why you picked microscope?
        - Well, Luis if you already know a lot about space
        - Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did
        - So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable
        - But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and Oliver on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence
        - Did you understand
        - Okay, so, Farrah
        - You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Did you understand you answer?
        - Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You said that you circled the same as Farrah
        - What did you understand
        - You understand that answer?
        - Can you share with your, your students Farrah
        - Yeah, how did you come up with that answer
        - Can you tell me a little bit more about that
        - Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine
        - And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?
        - So that's one thing that they used
        - What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that Luis?
        - How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - And why is that a big deal
        - Okay so Farrah, they do use microscopes right?
        - And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?
        - Do you know if it had
        - A more specific name
        - Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name
        - What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure
        - So how can that make it valuable
        - and Luis Can you tell me a little bit about your answer
        - You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment
        - All right, Chris
        - So you talked about
        - Why did you, why did you look for
        - Why did you say that they use small machines
        - So you specified that they use small machines
        - So why did you say they use microscopes
        - Okay, very good
        - Why did you say not for a long time
        - You said no because not not for a long time
        - So, Luis, the water can be
        - You said that water can be split into two parts
        - Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts
        - Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question
        - What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water
        - So that would be good
        - Chris, you talk to me about water being heavy
        - Why did you choose to talk to me about that
        - Why did you say they're not ready yet
        - They you said they're not ready yet
        - Okay, so it lands where?
        - So, Oliver, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome
        - Can you tell me what that means
        - Okay, so it is an equipment
        - What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?
        - How did you get to that answer
        - So when you are listening and answering this question
        - Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope
        - Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer
        - What made that microscope stick out to you
        - And what made you think about the craters on the moon
        - Wow, what were you using it to find?
        - So let's talk about that just a little bit
        - So what made you choose that as your answer
        - Will you tell me what what
        - your thought process was for answering that
        - What made you choose that word
        - What made you choose the word microscope
        - Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else
        - I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger
        - So that is true
        - It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that
        - You kind of both have very similar responses
        - It's not ready yet
        - So Luis Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no
        - So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's
        - So what do you mean by that
        - You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time
        - Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time
        - How come you do that
        - So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as Farrah
        - So did you find that on your own prior to Farrah writing that or did you kind of just copy that?
        - It says, NASA send a small machine
        - What was the name of that small machine
        - And then if you look at Jazmin's answer
        - Or how did you come to that conclusion
        - Can you explain what you mean by that
        - Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as Farrah
        - Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion
        - Why do you think that
        - But if they could get to it
        - What do you think
        - And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it
        - And why do you think that
        - Jazmin, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated
        - Why is that true?
        - Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right
        - Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?
        - Say that we do have enough money
        - And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?
        - So, Farrah, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water
        - You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Why would they need to use a microscope
        - So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used
        - What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence
        - And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence
        - Right, right, Oliver
        - Okay, why did you circle equipment
        - And why did you circle discover
        - All right
        - So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon
        - How did you know that water's heavy
        - What is it you know about space
        - Luis But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon
        - Thank you
- intent: r420.2
  examples: |
        - Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer
        - Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific Jazmin because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine
        - Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific
        - you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does
        - But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read
        - So take a second and write a new answer yes, Jazmin
        - Yes, Oliver, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as Farrah, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her
        - So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail
        - But they, It was a small machine
        - Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer
        - We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence
        - To discover the water
        - So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer
        - So I know where your answer came from
        - Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as Farrah, but if you could find that in the text and circle it
        - That would be awesome
        - I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me
        - Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine
        - Did you find that in the text?
        - They called it a microscope
        - That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now
        - Looking into and finding it for the first time
        - Can you look for that for me
        - Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question
        - You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth
        - So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher
        - You want to make sure I'm in for sure
        - Then I'm kind of in the dark
        - So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer
        - I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there
        - But it may be a smaller amount
        - Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon
        - I think we can be a little more specific in your response
        - Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there
        - So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely
        - Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends
        - And we're very specific when we're writing
        - That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are
        - A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way
        - And I think we can kind of change how that sets up
        - So you could say, NASA
        - I think would convey your meeting
        - Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically
        - Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those
        - So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring
        - So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine
        - Well, that'd be a good strategy
        - So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more
        - However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right
        - And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text Farrah
        - Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer
        - But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need
        - How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon
        - So I think you would have your sentence was great
        - Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable
        - Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text
        - I'm Jazmin, you wrote that NASA send a small machine
        - That's very good
        - So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called
        - Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text
        - So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with Jazmin
        - Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this
        - And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence
        - Does that make sense
        - Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen
        - Now let's go a little bit further with that answer
        - Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope
        - So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it
        - But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does
        - So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable
        - But we want to say give like an a yes or no question
        - If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving
        - They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart
        - Maybe, but you can also use the passage
        - Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable
        - Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more
        - He said it could be useful because it can be broken down
        - Yeah, and that's what Luis said
        - And said what is valuable about breaking it down
        - That's the only thing I would have done
        - So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your
        - Thank you, them
        - Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words
        - Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question
        - What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you
        - Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine
        - So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer
        - You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total
        - You're right
        - So your answer is almost there
        - So NASA send a small machine
        - It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - Jazmin your answer
        - You just need to add a little bit more information to it
        - So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay
        - But sometimes we have to look around too
        - Yeah, sometimes that works
        - Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article
        - So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation
        - So we have to describe that
        - But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?
        - So we have to name it
        - So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers
        - Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? Luis?
        - It could be a machine
        - It can be, words like machine or a tool
        - Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment
        - It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer
        - We need to restate that question in our answers
        - Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question
        - Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment
        - So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it
        - So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer
        - So we could say
        - It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it
        - The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter
        - And yeah guys, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and
        - You did, and quite a few details
        - Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible
        - So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment
        - So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence
        - You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do
        - Does that make sense
        - You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right
        - Do you guys understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers
        - So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response
        - Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is
        - So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable
        - And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it
        - Does that help better explain it to you Oliver
        - So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible
        - Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question
        - You got to make sure you add all of your details, does that help?
        - And when you answer your question
        - What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine
        - So you could be looking for something more specific
        - So when you're reading
        - So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - You could you should name that machine
        - And looking for a specific question
        - In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to
        - To answer them
        - So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks
        - If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it
        - The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines
        - And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer
        - And the text
        - And it answers the question better
        - You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here
        - Like Farrah, or a neighbor
        - Jazmin, I see you have a question
        - I want to hear what you found
        - So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it
        - Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend
        - Does that make sense
        - We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be
        - We can answer
        - Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers
        - And so the more detail
        - I mean, the more detail
        - but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day
        - Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question
        - And so maybe the substitute didn't have that
        - Does that make sense
        - Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends
        - Maybe if you working in partners of two
        - So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific
        - What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific
        - So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that's the only thing I would add to yours
        - Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question
        - That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading
        - So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her
        - What is it that she picked that I agree with
        - Does that make sense
        - Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah
        - Go ahead and think about why you might agree with Farrah
        - So if we rewrote our answers
        - If we might do that in a minute
        - And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response
        - but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was
        - Alright, so, Luis, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer
        - So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be
        - So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose
        - So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific
        - Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter
        - I think for us to build on your answer
        - We'd have a complete full answer to that question
        - I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer
        - So you have a good start
        - I think so
        - If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now
        - And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just
        - but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right
        - If we go back into the text
        - I but I think NASA
        - We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer
        - So looking in the text
        - Where could we are, what could we add
        - So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine
        - You said NASA send a small machine
- intent: r120.3
  examples: |
        - And Farrah Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?
        - Excellent and Oliver could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle
        - And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around Chris, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one For the name of the equipment they use
        - Excellent Jazmin could you read the second paragraph, for us
        - Luis just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us
        - can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking Chris
        - One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me Chris
        - can you reread that chunk of the text for me
        - Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's all look back at our question
        - Let's look back at number one
        - Do you want to if you guys want to read this question for me
        - Farrah, do you want to read it for me
        - So we are going to look back in our passage
        - So I will everybody to get back into their passage
        - Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - The water they found is microscopic
        - Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - Go back to the text and look
        - The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate
        - Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment
        - Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage
        - Can you look at your passage with me
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters
        - And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, Farrah and and the group
        - If you look at their paragraph four
        - So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?
        - Would you like Chris, would you like to read the second paragraph?
        - So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?
        - Can anybody tell me
        - Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be
        - Let's look back at the text
        - Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Can who can read that for sentence to me
        - Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot
        - This would hold only 32 ounces of water
        - But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again
        - And I want to challenge, just like Chris, take a look at that question
        - Can you read the question for me
        - Let me point you in the right direction
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three
        - Look at paragraph three
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        - Again, Luis
        - Look at that question again
        - Can you read it out loud for me
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate
        - Jazmin, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph
        - Question number one out loud for us
        - Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read
        - So could I have someone
        - Will you read
        - I saw your hand first
        - Question number one for us, please
        - Farrah, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence
        - Can you, can everyone look back at number three on your document
        - So let's see
        - I'm gonna stop you there
        - We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        - Can you do that for me?
        - All right, so, Farrah, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading
        - so Jazmin, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?
        - So can you guys look back at paragraph two?
        - So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence
        - What does it say Jazmin?
        - Now, Oliver, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?
        - Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two
        - Let's see, Chris
        - Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        - Luis It will you read the question back to me
        - But we look back at the question for me
        - If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me
        - And then in the second paragraph, right there
        - Okay, so, but before we do that can Farrah
        - Will you read the question aloud to the group, please
        - Would you read it aloud place
        - how about Luis Would you go back and read paragraph two for us
        - Luis we read it to me one more time
        - So let's look at the question again
        - That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you
        - So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now
        - So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response
        - So why don't you read that question for me again
        - Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so Luis wants to read the second question for us
        - So, but if we look on down in paragraph
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - In their paper with me
        - Okay, so everybody look at your paper
        - Jazmin, can you just read that for me again
        - Let's look at paragraph two
        - What did you just just read it one more time for me
        - Oliver, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay
        - So when you look back at your reading
        - And that they use equipment to search for things
        - The whole thing a paragraph two,
        - And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have Luis read that sentence for us
        - Can you read the next sentence for me Oliver
        - Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one
        - And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three
        - The water they found is, what's the word there?
        - Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth
        - So if you look at paragraph number three
        - I'm going to read it
        - You follow along
        - So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, Luis
        - Okay, and what else does it say about it
        - Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - Well, let's look at it together
        - Okay, let's see
        - Look at paragraph five,
        - It says, water is a valuable resource
        - I want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage
        - I want you to go back and look at the passage
        - Luis, are we rereading, make sure you're reading our passage
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day
        - Okay, so let's look back to paragraph
        - So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource
        - Let's see
        - Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource
        - Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water
        - Water is heavy
        - And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon
        - So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, Farrah?
        - But what does the first sentence say?
        - Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those Jazmin, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine
        - Yes, those are great equipment words
        - So can some, Farrah or one of you, which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1?
        - Paragraph 1
        - Go ahead, Farrah
        - Are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert?
        - Let see
        - Did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three? And then we'll talk about those four answers
        - Let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3
        - So paragraph 3
        - Who would like to read 3? Chris, would you like to read it?
        - Very good
        - But that's a very good start
        - So let's keep reading paragraph 3, and then we're going to go back, and we're going it's kind of getting more information, OK
        - Who would like to read three?
        - So paragraph three
        - So in the text, I think it was in
        - In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah
        - Other questions, man
        - Oh gosh, remind me
        - And while you're reading it
        - So read that sentence again for me
        - I'm going to talk with Oliver
        - Let's all look at our text
        - and in our text when we look at our texts
        - So what machine was used to find the water
        - So I think we all need to reread the passage
        - Okay, one more time
        - I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again
        - All right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?
        - Now, Jazmin
        - So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine
        - So we're going to move down to paragraph number three
        - Can you all find paragraph number three
        - So let's look back at
        - paragraphs three and four specifically
        - Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute
        - A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk
        - How's that sound
        - As a group, look back at paragraphs three and four
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - The beginning of paragraph two, okay
        - Let's look back individually
        - Let's look back, I'll give you guys about a minute or so individually
        - So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits
        - Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Let's look back at the text
        - So if you look at our original question
        - Let's go back and Decode that question
        - That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs
        - But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,
        - water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Everybody look back with us and Jazmin read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine
        - What do you see there?
        - Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read
        - You could look at the sentence
        - It says rocket fuel
        - It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways
        - The second part where waters valuable resource
        - The part of the paragraph
        - The article
        - Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer
        - I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so Chris
- intent: r120.2
  examples: |
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes Chris
        - So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon
        - So today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, so thank you all for sharing your answers
        - So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water
        - So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - What equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - So you answered the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, thank you very much
        - So listen closely
        - Yeah, I'm going to read the question
        - Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon
        - What equipment
        - Did they use to discover that water
        - All of you can take a look at the question again
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you can take a look at your passage
        - And in your question
        - Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, we've just answered what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at our passage and see what equipment
        - Did they use to find that
        - Okay, but we're going to what equipment
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So let's look back at our question
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water
        - So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water
        - Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right, so Farrah, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon
        - The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon
        - What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water
        - Does that help?
        - So let's look at your responses
        - So the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - But so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, please, can you please read the question again
        - And Chris, you can you please read the question again?
        - One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon
        - Okay, let's talk about the questions
        - So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover
        - So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific
        - What did they use to discover
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment
        - Did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - It would be a good answer to the question, right
        - Let's look at the question again
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the
        - Moon could be valuable
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look back at our question
        - Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this
        - Okay, I've read your responses to our question
        - Let me reread the question again
        - Let me read
        - Hold on just one second
        - So, Luis
        - The question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        - So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon
        - What do you think they sent
        - Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon
        - Why don't you start with what it, what
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question that we're going to talk about this time around is
        - I'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What are the key words in that question
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What, we're going to look at the question
        - The question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - In the question
        - And what equipment did they use
        - because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and
        - So what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - That's right
        - Now let's see is, does anybody want to share why they think water could be valuable?
        - Alright, so we just talked read the article water on the moon
        - And the question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But can you find what the what NASA used to investigate the water on the moon?
        - So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?
        - But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?
        - They sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment
        - So, and our question said that NASA
        - Did they sebd to investigate water
        - Okay, so now what does it say that they sent
        - What did they send to investigate
        - Our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Because we need to know which
        - Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so
        - So what if I put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was
        - So, question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - That's our question to
        - Um, so my question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Okay, so, um,
        - What equipment do they use to find the water
        - So while I'm talking to
        - because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that
        - So do you think it would be
        - Important to have water on the moon
        - Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look at our question
        - So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Let's start off with rereading the question
        - And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon
        - The question was we read our story
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - All right, so let's talk about the question
        - Everybody gave a different answer
        - What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right, who heard in that story what they use
        - What was the name of that scientific tool
        - Well, let's look at our discussion question
        - Now, have y'all already thought of your answers for this question?
        - It said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right, you guys
        - With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon
        - What equipment is used to discover water on the moon
        - So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text
        - Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon
        - And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - All right, I appreciate it
        - Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - We talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable
        - So it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon Could be valuable
        - So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value
        - Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So have all you thought about that?
        - But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon
        - So I'll read the question again for you guys but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - We're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable
        - Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Where did you get the question is what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource
        - The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon
        - And we talked about equipment we have, like you said, the tablets and pencils
        - But what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Of you guys are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Okay, so we're looking at, again, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Yes Farrah?
        - What equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so I asked you what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Let's, let's go over some of your responses here,
        - Okay, thank you
        - Good to see everybody
        - Okay, good
        - Very good
        - Okay, so what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so what we went before we went to lunch we were talking about our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So going back to answer our question
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - It's scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So, Farrah, do you want to start with the question what equipment
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So the question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You know that, um, but I'm just going to direct you to the question, which is Scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - So what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon
        - Let's pause and let's let everybody look at the question
        - Question number one
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Question one WHAT equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What did we decide
        - So moving on to question number two it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable

        - So how did you go about correcting your answer
        - Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be
        - Now that we've discussed it
        - So what kind of helped us find our answer
        - So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your think
        - How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently
        - OK, so now that I have given you guys some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking
        - Then, how that changed
        - So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did
        - Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer
        - Can you help me figure out the why
        - So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning
        - So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change
        - Oliver, has that change your thinking a little bit?
        - Alright so let's all think what did we learn about changing our answers today?
        - Do you see any ways does your mind kind of changing
        - Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your group
        - So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response
        - And now I think this way because And then you can tell me
        - So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what
        - So, reflect on that process what that was like
        - You started out thinking a certain way and now you think
        - So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process
        - I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank
        - So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now
        - Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you
        - Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer
        - But now what they know is the right answer
        - Does anyone else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
        - Does anyone else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
        - Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers
        - Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so Luis what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have
        - Okay Farrah, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change
        - yeah so I want you guys to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future
        - So I would love to hear from Oliver Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you guys just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can
        - Alright cool Luis so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response, a little bit more specific to what you read today
        - awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas
        - Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer what was different about those two
        - Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?
        - what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
        - mm hmm so let's just think about as a team like What did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? Oliver
        - So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
        - OK so Luis do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking
        - Great so Luis now that you're participating already Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response
        - is there anything else did anyone do anything different when they were revising their answer
        - First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions
        - yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that
        - And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
        - mm hmm and has your thinking changed at all about how they found it
        - Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think
        - What was different about your first answer and your second you said
        - So how can I ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer what was what was different and how other than just writing more, what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer
        - How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think
        - Thank you okay so Jazmin do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions
        - Whatever you think it's Okay, if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you all are thinking so take a moment before our conversation I thought this after our conversation I thought this
        - Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, but just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think
        - has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this Chris sorry I saw your hand was up
- intent: r410.2
  examples: |
        - Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be
        - but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right
        - You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely
        - So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great
        - But when you tell me about the tool
        - What are we trying to do to the water, guys
        - So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water
        - So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water
        - Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer
        - What small machine? What was it called?
        - You could have been looking at her paper
        - You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does
        - okay and in your answer
        - Does your answer tell what discovered the water?
        - but it's not quite the only thing that they used
        - You're right
        - There are a piece of equipment that they used
        - And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool
        - So scientists do use those type of things
        - Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific
        - So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer
        - I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text
        - It's answering a different question
        - But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us
        - So even though your answer is true
        - Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific
        - And that is very, very true, but it's not exactly phrased in the way that answers the question
        - Thinking back on what I just told Luis, does it answer the question that we are asking
        - Well, just because you need to have a deeper understanding doesn't mean your answers wrong just that you could probably put in a little more detail in your answer
        - And that's a it's an equipment, isn't it, but we look in the passage for a specific small machine and it tells us in the passage that there is a it gives us the name of the small machine
        - But it's not the specific machine
        - And Luis That you put scientists found is using a small machine so that small machine is correct that small machine could be any sort of tool
        - So all those facts are right that you guys had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay
        - So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to Farrah, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and
        - So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?
        - So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity
        - If we were more, a little more specific, I should say
        - But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding
        - So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically
        - And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at
        - but it's still wrong
        - We want to know about this equipment
        - The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but
        - If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space
        - They absolutely do
        - Yes, yes, they do
        - But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story
        - So we got to make sure that when we're answering
        - We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were
        - And that is really close to what we're looking for here
        - So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine
        - So, good job
        - Yes, so NASA did send a small machine
        - In this case, Jazmin was a little too vague
        - Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for
        - This is how you go about doing it
        - We're talking about NASA specifically right
        - We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon
        - We're talking about someone that's already done
        - But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific
        - but can I ask you another question about that
        - So is that convincing me that water would be valuable?
        - Okay, so that is true
        - That is something that we read in the story, but does it answer the questions about what they used
        - Let's see
        - That's true, but we want to focus on the text
        - I think we just need some more to it
        - But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - Wow, that's very possible and Chris, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy
        - That is true
        - So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting guys to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water
        - Does that make sense
        - But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too
        - You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon
        - Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space
        - I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water
        - I don't think the intention is for it to discover water
        - The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts
        - It's just a little bit incomplete
        - So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me
        - It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent
        - So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete
        - Because some of us are, you know, technically correct, but not not super correct like Luis over there said oxygen tanks
        - Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to The moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water
        - We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine
        - And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true
        - It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's
        - And could you discover water with that specific tool
        - Could you go into space
        - I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now
        - So my suggestion to all of you would be to maybe
        - So, back to you
        - Svannah and Oliver the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water
        - I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific
        - But I do think water is valuable
        - Nancy Jazmin
        - So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment
        - Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that
        - But you focus on the article
        - But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon
        - Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that
        - It's really cool
        - They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable
        - So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with Farrah, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it
        - So when we look at our key words and then our key words there in the passage
        - We know that it's got to be more than just that
        - Right, we would think that, but when we look at our key words from the text we got to remember, it's telling us the answers in the text
        - And we got to look for the specific answer
        - lets people know what you're talking about
        - Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter
        - We're not going to which question
        - It goes to
        - Master breathe with and they use different equipment for different task, but we needed to know specifically what they used to discover the Water Rat
        - Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter
        - They're not going to what we're talking about
        - What if we put
        - Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text
        - It didn't talk about that
        - So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is
        - Does that make sense
        - And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters
        - Yes, you need to be just a little more descriptive in your response
        - But once you add that little extra bit of adding the official name of what equipment was used, then you're going to be on the right track
        - but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that
        - answers the question better
        - but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely
        - It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it
        - I think you need to add a little bit more
        - So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph
        - When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things
        - Does that make sense
        - So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story
        - Does that make a little bit more sense
        - So their ships wouldn't have to carry it
        - Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it
        - So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon
        - So is it heavy
        - Uh, your answer is technically correct
        - The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter
        - Okay, Farrah you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery
        - You just picked the wrong one
        - We're not talking about space, though
        - So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that
        - Well that's good that you know a lot about space
        - Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text
        - While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster
        - We want to see what they say
        - So we want
        - Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine
        - But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon
        - Do you understand that
        - So let's look at the question again
        - So your answer doesn't really relate to that question
        - But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes
        - I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that
        - So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space
        - So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics
        - Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?
        - oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you
        - Luis So it does talk about oxygen
        - No, you're right
        - But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment
        - So we know that one doesn't answer a question
        - So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water
        - But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen
        - But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool
        - That is correct
        - This scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - That is a tool that they use
        - Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yes, it should be a good answer there
        - But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out
        - Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on
        - But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out
        - I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water
        - It doesn't have enough water, but it hasn't not enough of something else that we have to have do me a favor
        - So, you missed one part of that because it works as a group
        - Okay, Mr
        - They don't really say that, is where Mr
        - Luis talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts
        - It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks, do they do use them
        - Yes, but not in this text
        - You just needed the name of the item that they used
        - um I it's not wrong it's just you can add a little bit you can add more to it and have it be a more complete dot not that isn't like a complete thought, but like
        - But yeah i'm so Farrah had a good answer it could have been longer but
        - Your answer is not wrong but it's not correct, you said yes, they use a small machine and the Lunar orbit is a machine, but it was not as specific as I would have wanted to hear
        - Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it
        - I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope
        - And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,
        - And, as I talked, as I said, to Farrah she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah
        - One part you were missing, though, is
        - So what were they looking at closely
        - What they were looking at
        - I really want to hear
        - So I didn't
        - I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as Farrah
- intent: r430.2
  examples: |
        - Absolutely, and you are, you are, you are correct and, but when we're asking you in this question is to circle, the evidence, so we want you to draw your answer from something specifically that you read here
        - Luis was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use
        - But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that
        - so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words
        - so Farrah and Oliver both circled microscope
        - that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely
        - Chris, you have a question
        - so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover
        - I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter M, if that's helpful
        - You can look back in your reading for that
        - I would love if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is
        - And Jazmin NASA send out a small machine
        - Well, they used a lunar orbiter
        - But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for
        - So a little more in depth
        - They did send a small machine, right, that is, but it was asking specifically
        - So your answer
        - So could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment
        - What that piece of equipment's name was?
        - But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about
        - That's very good
        - So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct
        - That's very good
        - So in the article
        - Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there
        - Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water
        - Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment
        - I think that we could even
        - So this is kind of for all of us here
        - Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters
        - I think he would be on a great, great track
        - And Luis might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there
        - If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question
        - So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that
        - You can use this to do that
        - Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well
        - Why don't we change the subject
        - Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water
        - We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water
        - So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close
        - Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a
        - So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine
        - I need to dig a little deeper
        - And what else does the passage
        - So with your answer
        - Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable
        - What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen
        - Does that make sense
        - So you want to say yes it's valuable because of all the things that you were saying
        - You guys are all close but you want to get an exact answer
        - So you want to expand your answer a little bit
        - So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage
        - It was a small machine, Jazmin
        - I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down
        - And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down
        - So that's the only thing I would add to your answer
        - and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used
        - Make sure you back things up, it takes like Farrah Farrah, you know, like in your answer
        - You didn't really back it up
        - I want you to read that last paragraph for me, Chris
        - Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read
        - They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon
        - Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking
        - So, Farrah and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track
        - But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer
        - Does that make sense
        - You, you just said I circled the same as Farrah, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did
        - So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But there's, it's more descriptive
        - But what was the machine called and what did it do?
        - And you're right, it is a small machine
        - They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine
        - So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific
        - It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it
        - I like that you
        - To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you
        - So can you come up with a new way
        - However, if we were talking just about our reading passage
        - Those are not necessarily in there
        - It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer
        - A Farrah, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote
        - Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's
        - So next time
        - Okay, so next time
        - Does that make sense
        - You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water
        - In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question
        - Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was was the name of that small machine small machine
        - but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific
        - That is an excellent point
        - Why would that be useful
        - So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence
        - So what is that next sentence say
        - But I want you to think about why that would be useful
        - Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen
        - So instead, let's focus on your opinion
        - So is there
        - So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific
        - So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question
        - You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid
        - What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine
        - We need to make that answer specific
        - So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question
        - So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - : Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question
        - So all you have right now is evidence
        - And then you explain that evidence
        - What was the name of the small machine that was used
        - And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you
        - So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer
        - What was your answer to that question
        - In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so Chris
        - Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself
        - Is it wrong
        - What was that small machine used for
        - Well, your, your answer
        - I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used
        - You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own
        - You just said you circled the same thing as Farrah
        - So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in Farrah's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it
        - Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon
        - Um, well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying, NASA send a small machine, but, um, you could have talked about what that machine was and how it But, um, yeah
        - So you weren't you weren't wrong
        - Oh, it's just, I'm a little too broad
        - um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks, you can maybe mentioned, like the soup thing where because that's also equipment, because they needed to be up there on
        - But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote
        - So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly
        - it's a wide range for an answer, so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay
        - was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA
        - You said I remember your response
        - We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text
        - But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific
        - Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you
        - I still want you to say an answer, because I want everybody to be giving an answer
        - And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer
        - Tool a microscope to look really closely
        - That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific
        - You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon
        - you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water, I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer
        - but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail
        - So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information
        - To the moon
        - So, that's correct
        - But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon
        - So you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon, but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response, you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like Farrah and Jazmin added
        - However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that
        - My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and
        - so with  your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it
        - So we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text
        - Instead, your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading
        - but I would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text
        - Like for example, we know that NASA used the Rover to find water on the moon
        - Maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer
        - And we want to go a little bit further, we want to dig a little bit deeper
        - But we want to explore a little bit further
        - Ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read, could they learn that information from your answer
        - Your answer isn't wrong Jazmin
        - I want you to expand your answer
        - I want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine
        - Is that OK with you
        - So I want you to find your answer in the text because I want us to practice that skill
        - But I do want us to practice being that reading detective
        - Totally and and that's very helpful
        - Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer
        - I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence
        - It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer
        - And why can you tell me if this is good or bad, and why
        - I'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing
        - But my concern is, would you look carefully at the passage I think you have targeted the right place in the passage
        - You just need to be a little more specific
        - You want to use the text for our answers
        - We don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable
        - yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too, so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals
        - The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine
        - In this way, that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so
        - Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and
        - but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?
        - i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question
        - Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water
        - To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used
        - Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use
        - Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again
        - Yes, oh, you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions
        - So what i'm noticing in Farrah's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon
        - But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used
        - but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think
        - To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question
        - so Jazmin is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture
        - So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick
        - I am wondering if we could get more specific Jazmin right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this
        - And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay
        - You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text
        - So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be
- intent: r510.1
  examples: |
        - so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence
        - Absolutely that's great that is a great definition of what evidence is right when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question
        - so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use
        - All right, um Chris, can you explain to me what evidence is
        - But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us
        - Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers
        - We just needed to look more closely at our text
        - So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were all really close
        - It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for
        - Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question
        - It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say
        - So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question
        - More flow through this
        - The first time you scan it right
        - You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah
        - Does that make sense
        - And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again
        - So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question
        - But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking
        - Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer
        - You the strategy I talked about
        - Say, practice makes perfect
        - So if you want to be good at something, you keep john over and over and over
        - We found a key what
        - So remember when we looked at our question
        - You remember what I asked you to find
        - Keyword to help us and to answer the question
        - Did we need to answer this question
        - And what key word
        - It is so important
        - So always find and identify a keyword
        - So you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text
        - She used the passage that we provided to find her answer
        - I like how Jazmin was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and Luis that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond
        - That's very good
        - Again, I like how she's very specific
        - She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text
        - Yes, so we look really closely at those key words in our question
        - So remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text
        - So remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words
        - And then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer
        - It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next
        - So often when we read it will tell us a sequence
        - So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
        - Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence
        - Well, what I do agree
        - What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something
        - When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on
        - So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name
        - So I think we've all kind of like learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
        - Does that make sense
        - We know we all know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given
        - Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper
        - So we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words
        - Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question
        - Who thinks that they they can explain to Luis What what keywords
        - Alright, so let's look back at our question
        - But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings
        - So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer
        - Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence
        - And then what happened
        - Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text
        - You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question
        - So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened
        - And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was
        - I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific
        - So we went
        - So, so you built off your answer
        - Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct
        - We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for
        - And this is what it was doing
        - And much like with Jazmin earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question
        - Okay, again, so
        - And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components
        - That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together
        - And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
        - So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
        - So I really like to do is the race format
        - What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking
        - So for example, when I read
        - So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank
        - And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment
        - Where are we using yes Farrah
        - But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific,
        - So you can be give the best answer
        - So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords
        - See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
        - Yes, that is exactly what I would like
        - And that goes for everyone, not just Chris
        - So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading
        - great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer
        - What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question
        - Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water
        - So that was a really great response
        - So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well
        - You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why
        - What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using
        - Yes Farrah
        - There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before
        - So a lunar orbiter a microscope
        - yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions
        - Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning
        - That was a perfect or smart
        - Good job
        - It was very specific
        - So to find evidence
        - And she said, paragraph three, so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading
        - Farrah quoted
        - We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that
        - And in our responses we want to use academic language
        - It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers to use
        - I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you
        - It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning
        - and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water
        - Jazmin, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking
        - You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable
        - If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay
        - So Chris, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer
        - So when we're answering comprehension questions like this
        - We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information
        - I am going to give you some sentence starters and
        - This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies
        - So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question
        - So Farrah, and then you when you change your answer to what Jazmin also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        - She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon
        - Can You Do you remember
        - Can you restate what their strategy is
        - So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer
        - And you were able to find another part that you could add to it
        - Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing
        - and I think that that's an excellent strategy for anyone to think about when we're reading a text is to think
        - yeah Chris it's great all right i'm so glad that you have so much background
        - When you're trying to answer this question is just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph and then find us as they're seeing the paragraph here just located
        - When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
        - So that's a great process
        - So that's great that's a great segue
        - So what I wanted to ask you guys, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically
        - So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important Chris, you have something to add
        - are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question Oliver, what do you think
        - I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text so i'm
        - And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components
        - Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two
        - What i'm going to suggest to all of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
        - so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading
        - That can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it
        - We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers
        - All right, who's ready to start
        - yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists
        - Did anyone else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers
        - okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely
        - So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so
        - I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique
        - that's good yeah the thing about the thing about reading for keywords and sometimes authors will use synonyms so two words that mean the same thing, so when we're thinking about discovery definitely found or
        - yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
        - yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with Luis I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response
        - I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go
        - Fantastic so I really appreciate coming Luis just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here
        - The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response
        - I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text
        - so I think Jazmin you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two
        - yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy, you can use in response questions
        - Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so
        - But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text,
- intent: r410.1
  examples: |
        - But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - Absolutely and that's something that like Luis put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us
        - Also, Luis, your question or your answer
        - Had to do with equipment as well
        - But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main
        - It was the Lunar Orbiter
        - But that's not what the, um, that's not what
        - The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon
        - But I think you may be confused on the question,
        - And the question I think we need to be a little more specific
        - And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking
        - But the question is actually specifically pointing toward
        - And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it
        - What's the potential value
        - They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space
        - So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space
        - but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water
        - I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money
        - The question was, is water valueable
        - But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment
        - I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we all had
        - Because he answered, whether it was a good investment
        - Stop right there
        - So although you're, you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely, what it equip-- They're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it
        - But did they discover the water with the microscope?
        - So they use the microscope, microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water
        - but is the question asking is it right now
        - but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable
        - Not that they're ready
        - Would it be valuable to
        - But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically
        - So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together
        - Yes, very good
        - What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment
        - But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so
        - And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that
        - It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water
        - A little bit
        - But for this specific question
        - However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense
        - Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope
        - That's very good
        - It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking,
        - Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So when we look at yours, you don't necessarily answer the question i can i can tell what you're getting at by reading your evidence, but you don't actually specifically answer the question then provide evidence and then just explain it
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon
        - That's what the question was asked
        - It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples
        - If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar
        - Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up
        - Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect
        - You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question
        - That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used
        - we're talking about the equipment, so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment
        - yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked
        - Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water
        - But you didn't talk about the equipment
        - The question asked for you to talk about the equipment
        - This is for everybody, not just Chris, when you are talking about
        - So when you guys are
        - So you guys are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated
        - Farrah you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking
        - So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking
        - Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so
        - Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear
        - We're looking at when they used to find the water
        - Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one, so, while they do use those equipment, that's not what we're looking for for this question
        - So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon
        - What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so
        - Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked
        - which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon
        - But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry
        - But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is
        - But, that doesn't truly answer the question
        - Alright Luis, so, when we look back at the question
        - While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that
        - So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,
        - That is true and it's basically just what I told Chris, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water
        - but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines
        - To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water
        - but do you think that that's answering the question
        - part of the question do you think you're missing
        - Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question
        - Do you understand?
        - So your - Chris, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found
        - but in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water
        - And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon
        - Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use
        - But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-- is that a type of equipment?
        - The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically
        - We kind of need both
        - So although I really love your answer
        - And it did teach me something I do want you to answer the question
        - Yes, the water is an overload along a passage
        - The key words like equipment do agree
        - But my concern is other students and they circle
        - You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future
        - This is the next step after they discovered water for the morn, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one
        - However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly
        - The main question
        - So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us
        - So I'm going to give you guys 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it
        - And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question
        - And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer
        - So I want to ask all of you guys take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think: What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question
        - Can you tell me that
        - So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for
        - Are you able to tell me what the question is
        - But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text
        - Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us
        - The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts,
        - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon, so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using Chris, did you have a follow up about that
        - But another really important part of his question is the action
        - Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking
        - So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon
        - Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then Jazmin for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right
        - So they can be types of tools, yes, you know equipment gear all those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right
        - And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found
        - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it
        - I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water
- intent: r430.1
  examples: |
        - so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water
        - So in the text, you should be focusing on what would answer that specific question not not pre knowledge
        - So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water
        - You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question
        - So another suggestion is, once you have
        - And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon
        - They are using the microscope to look at the water
        - That is true
        - However, I like how Jazmin really looked at the question
        - That's a good place to start
        - So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question
        - Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions
        - What did they use to see the water
        - You did say a fair point
        - So you didn't quite answer the question there
        - So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use
        - Did they use
        - What type of equipment
        - What type of machines
        - But the question really was
        - And you've told me where on the moon
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The water was discovered
        - So what can you add to your thoughts to just make it a little bit stronger
        - Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment
        - Please read the question again do you have another key words like the action in the words in a sentence action word?
        - So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is
        - All right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly, it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically
        - To what the scientists use
        - So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once
        - What was the equipment that they use to find the water, so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water
        - The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time Chris what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements
        - My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment
        - Can you read locate the text and find the Oliverice that leads you lead the scientists to the water, I think that would make more sense with this particular question, but I think you did
- intent: r420.1
  examples: |
        - All right guys I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question
        - Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it
        - Yes, I can
        - I want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and I want you to find the most important word or the key word that you think is most important in this question
        - In the question what which which which most important word
        - Did you pick out in the question
        - A microscope is equipment
        - Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word
        - So right now, everybody to find action word and underline
        - That is a synonym for investigate
        - So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question
        - That's good
        - Find would be the same
        - So when we're answering questions we need to make sure we're answering the question that's being asked
        - Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see
        - Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that
        - If you look at what it should be
        - But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you
        - Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer
        - What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer
        - So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question
        - So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question
        - So again, let's look back at our question and look for two key words that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage
        - Yes, yes
        - Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question
        - So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to Jazmin
        - I want you guys to look at question number one
        - OK, so what I want us to do is just a minute
        - I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth
        - but I want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two key words that are important, that might help you answer the question
        - So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other
        - What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is
        - Saying what specifically
        - Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for
        - Once you reread that question
        - So, but let's look at the question again
        - So you get that information
        - As you're reading the test
        - You're the question is trying to answer so SCAM, IT LOOK AT THE QUESTION
        - And then read to answer the question
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence, I want you to go back and think deeper about the question
        - What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word
        - Okay, so what words, did we find in our text that helped us answer our question
        - There any words that we circled or underlined in our text
        - Is that I would read the questions first
        - Then I'd read the passage
        - So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions
        - but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering
        - And let's think about what key words
        - Do you hear when you are reading that question
        - So think about that on your own real quick and then we will discuss what keywords, we see
        - So let's think about that question together real quick
        - Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important
        - There's two words that are very important in this question
        - Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that
        - When you've circled your two key words
        - If you will just look up at me when you're finished
        - What do you think
        - Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words
        - That's all right
        - 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words
        - So let's
        - What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover
        - Looks like we're finished
        - Um, so what do you guys think what is another word for equipment
        - Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so
        - We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it
        - What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question
        - The two main action words
        - Or verbs in this question
        - So I'll give you about
        - And I want you to take your pencil and just circle
        - The two action words in the question
        - All right, so what I think we should do, after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question
        - That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text
        - So if y'all looked at that question
        - The first question I answered a
        - Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question
        - What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question
        - So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session
        - So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes
        - Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you
        - Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure
        - So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute, take some time and look back that question and circle that okay
        - This is confusing to me
        - Miss Teacher what about this word
        - What's to that to you about that question, something about it
        - Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about
        - First, I want you to look about that question
        - Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that Oliver used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that
        - And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions
        - So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of Olivers and savannas answers
        - Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text
        - So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay
        - Is there anyone here because I want to make sure we understand the question
        - One question I want to ask, is there anyone here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means
        - Chris, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question
        - All right
        - All right, is there anything we have here, right
        - There are some words that you weren't sure about
        - Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one
        - We need water to survive
        - So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you
        - Okay, well I'm very glad to hear
        - now Jazmin, what's your question?
        - But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give
        - By throwing in a little something that could be the answer
        - But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question
        - It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers
        - Does that make sense
        - We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response
        - But let's look back at the question that was proposed
        - So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer
        - Would anybody like to reread that for me
        - Thank you
        - So does anybody have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for
        - At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question
        - Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words
        - Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to
        - I think you'll be able to better
        - You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense
        - And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely
        - plug it back in
        - Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question
        - and looking for the keywords in your question as well
        - And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question
        - That way we can answer the question
        - You guys are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text
        - But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one
        - So take just a second
        - What were the key words
        - But what were, what was the keywords in number one
        - And your answer is closer to a correct answer
        - And I want you guys to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key
        - Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question
        - So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question
        - But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how
        - So what keywords help us answer this question
        - About what words, can we underline in that question to help us answer the question
        - So just for a second here
        - Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it
        - What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence
        - So if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points of circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer
        - I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right
        - I have a timer going right now
        - All right
        - I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that
        - yeah so Oliver and Farrah that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response, so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that
        - you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future
        - But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely
        - So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text
        - when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer all parts of the question and that you're specific as possible
        - so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need
        - now before you share the answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled
        - Can everyone do that?
        - I want to do that for one minute and then come back
        - So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important
        - My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used
        - yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment
        - What I suggest, what you guys do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for
        - So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner
        - And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question
        - Where Am I find these words and the passage alright, so you have two minutes, with your partners
        - You two can start working on your second answer
        - When you go back, I want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves, what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text
        - It's looking for
        - Very good
        - Go back to the question and reread it, please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note Of what kind of answer
        - Chris, you identified the main idea of this passage
        - So I want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment, the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question
        - And Luis again
        - I did you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject
        - Identify what kind of answer the question is asking for
        - See if or reviewed your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text
        - It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do
        - And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion
        - OK, so now please look at the question again, you are going to find out to look keywords all the most important words in a question before you answer it
        - So I think you guys understand what I'm saying
        - Thank you for your response
        - I saw Jazmin and Oliver not nodding their head
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question
        - Please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the keywords all the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important in a question, the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - And I want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important
        - I'll give you a minute to do that
        - Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for
        - Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question
        - Can you tell me what they want you to understand
        - So we want to make sure to understand the whole question
        - So we understand what they're asking us
        - And so just like I mentioned to Luis and Jazmin is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question
        - I think that's a great point, though, Oliver is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us
        - So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence, who can give me the action word
        - So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question
        - But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, Chris
        - And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking
- intent: r210.1
  examples: |
        - An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water
        - Okay, do you want to share your answer with us
        - Right to help them survive
        - Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right
        - Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate
        - Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?
        - Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy
        - Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time
        - I can't really can't carry
        - They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the
        - That's right
        - Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful
        - Yeah, they used to go home
        - Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how
        - But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence
        - But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope
        - What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter
        - So your answer actually would be correct
        - But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters
        - You would need a microscope
        - But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live
        - And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen
        - And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things
        - Yeah, that that was a very good answer
        - You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen
        - So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen
        - Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen
        - And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe
        - And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things
        - For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it
        - Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have
        - Okay, they do use that in space
        - But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water
        - So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water
        - Find, is a perfect word
        - So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time
        - That's absolutely right
        - To address Chris question, I would just like to clarify
        - So when we talk about NASA here were first of all two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here
        - So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground
        - Water on the moon be valuable
        - Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this
        - Each each Oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks
        - The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for
        - But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?
        - Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space
        - Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it
        - You could just say a rug
        - You guys have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them
        - Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house
        - Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that Chris as well
        - Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter
        - I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but
        - on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how
        - So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it
        - So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment
        - So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable
        - This is a a question that asked for your opinion
        - So, people might have different opinions, but all opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text
        - Some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions
        - That's okay if you disagree with each other
        - So we might disagree with each other
        - Does anyone know what a partial answer means?
        - Okay, so I put all of us into this group because everyone here has a partial answer
        - Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water
        - I was like, Well, I thought about this all night
        - that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA
        - I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have all these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph
        - Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well
        - And that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment
        - You need different tools for different tasks right? Oliver
        - But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans
        - So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?
        - yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA
        - That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,
        - and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there
        - So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water Farrah and you find something yeah okay
        - Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while
        - yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks
        - And that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong you guys had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers
- intent: r120.1
  examples: |
        - Do you think you know it
        - Does anybody know
        - So look back at your answer
        - Is that all that they used?
        - Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle
        - You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer
        - Luis Let's talk about your answer
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool
        - Did they have to use
        - Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate
        - Did you find that answer in there?
        - So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - Jazmin, what else do you think?
        - Can you gues do that?
        - So Farrah and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and Luis I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used
        - How do we answer this question
        - What was your response?
        - So Luis our science expert, out of paragraph two
        - So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        - Let's discuss your answer real quick
        - The paragraph number
        - Read again number three
        - Okay, do you have something to add to Farrah's answer
        - Jazmin, you want to add something?
        - What do you think this Jazmin?
        - Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon
        - But what did they use to find actually water on the moon
        - But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon
        - What do you think that should be a good answer to that question
        - Yes, that is an answer
        - Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over
        - Let's see, Luis
        - Would you like more time?
        - What is the question actually ask us
        - Using this strategy
        - How would you answer that question
        - Would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer?
        - Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer
        - So we can go ahead and go back
        - I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up
        - Is there anything you want to maybe add to that
        - But I want us to go back and look at that again
        - To see if there is convincing evidence because
        - I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer
        - And so let's look back and see
        - So, Farrah and Oliveron
        - but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing
        - Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon
        - Does that make sense Chris?
        - and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon
        - So, Luis, and Jazmin
        - You guys have been working together and Jazmin, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?
        - But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water
        - Did they use to find that water
        - So what machine
        - What do you guys think about that
        - I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it
        - So look back in paragraph 3
        - So Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - But what else did you need to know?
        - You guys look
        - Back at the sin to me
        - Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for
        - Do you think it would
        - So re rethink about that
        - Did you find any more information
        - Allright Jazmin while you were reading
        - Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better
        - and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it
        - All right, Chris, um, what was, what was your response
        - but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water
        - You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers,
        - Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read
        - But what did they use on the moon to discover water
        - Do you know what that that tool was called
        - So, Oliveron Farrah
        - What was the tool that they used on the moon
        - Does anybody have an idea
        - Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs
        - Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment
        - Um, what is the question asking us
        - Can you just tell me what that question means
        - So on there, you can make that on so again
        - Raise your hand when you find find an answer
        - So what's another word
        - Jazmin, what is the second heading
        - Everybody taken another second
        - I'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text
        - Yes, let's go back and look
        - What did you get out of the question
        - What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though
        - So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon
        - Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think
        - So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use
        - Is there any other equipment that we need
        - What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it
        - Was there anything else in the text
        - Luis I want you to keep thinking and Miss to
        - Chris, Mr
        - I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see
        - You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?
        - and I have your answers so Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - Did you see any other tools that you may need
        - Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it
        - but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon
        - Alright, so, from what I read what other
        - item that they need on the moon
        - Alright so Oliver Can you help me out after reading the story again
        - Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text
        - Can you find a different one?
        - That wasn't Jazmin or Luis's answer?
        - So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question
        - Oliver what's up it's your turn
        - it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include
        - So Jazmin, do you want to try?
        - So I want someone else to answer my question again
        - Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time
        - Maybe Farrah, do you want to try it? Farrah, do you want to try
        - Does anyone else want to try the question again besides Luis? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time
        - Okay, what else?
        - What else?
        - So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay
        - Give you time to think about it
        - Okay, I'll call on you in a second
        - So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found
        - That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?
        - Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger
        - so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of
        - An answer for that
        - How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed
        - Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that
        - And that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me?
        - Good so when you go and you look through the text, I want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay
        - Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon
        - Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully
        - Well that's, well, that's great
        - So, Luis, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?
        - Oh, you know what else?
        - And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer
        - So well I check in with Jazmin
        - Do you think that you could work on that a little bit
        - I think that we should all go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question
        - So maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer
        - Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer
        - Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey
        - Farrah I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer
        - What did we learn
        - So after reading that statement
        - Thank you, Oliver
        - You can, did you want to give that a try
        - Can you try
        - Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text
        - I see some few shaking their head
        - And see if you can find something different
        - Please raise your hand and let me know
        - We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used
        - And when you get to that part
        - What do we think they used
        - I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,
        - So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text
        - Can you remember what was that?
        - So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out
        - So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research
        - So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer
        - So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that
        - Are you able to do that for me
        - If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine
        - let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water
        - um do you Luis or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about
        - Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that Jazmin helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using
        - so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water
        - You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure
        - You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something
        - Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon
        - Oliver, can you add on
        - so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us
        - Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use
        - Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down
        - Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start
        - So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence
        - So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water
        - Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?
        - Remember, something else
        - but um let's let's keep building on that right good Jazmin
        - Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph Jazmin do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer
- intent: r130.3
  examples: |
        - What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So, to make our answer better
        - We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Okay then not full of water
        - Once they found it
        - So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it
        - You had to use a microscope
        - You can't even see it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny
        - But they didn't use it to discover the water
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose
        - The microscope is used for a different purpose
        - They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon
        - They do, yeah
        - But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose
        - We're trying to figure out which
        - That makes sense
        - Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon
        - So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource
        - It would take a long time
        - But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as Farrah, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So that should have been your answer
        - They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful
        - Well, they didn't send a microscope
        - They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right
        - They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon
        - And see the surface of the moon
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - equipment that they used
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry
        - Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it
        - They had to use a microscope
        - Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope
        - So we were looking for
        - They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They sent the lunar orbiter up
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that
        - So instead, it it checked for water on the moon
        - And it went
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon
        - And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope
        - Things like the microscope
        - Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean
        - And the Lunar Orbiter
        - We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things
        - OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - and the ice deposits
        - That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        - They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things
        - So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water
        - So first they had to find it
        - And then they could investigate using the microscope
        - But as they were as time goes on It could be
        - I think that it could be valuable
        - Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet
        - So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future
        - It can be valuable
        - Does that make sense
        - So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one
        - That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water
        - And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water
        - So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they used to see the ice deposits
        - Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off
        - So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow
        - So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - looks for ice deposits
        - And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had
        - But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon
        - And that was the orbit
        - NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin
        - It's am from our end
        - I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage
        - They talk about NASA as Jazmin was talking, they do send a small machine
        - Okay, but in the top of the reading
        - And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which Farrah brought up and Oliver
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they helped find water
        - Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink
        - So that's a valuable way that we could use water now
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water
        - That isn't what they used to discover it
        - They sent a machine up there
        - Um, I don't think so
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen
        - So you might have circled water as well
        - So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water
        - But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter
        - The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter
        - So even though we're not using the water right now
        - So in this case, they didn't
        - It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope
        - But there's other ways to detect it
        - but they use a different tool on the moon to discover
        - When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon
        - But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time
        - That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely
        - And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely
        - And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, Jazmin, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, Jazmin was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father
        - So when we write our answer
        - We would, we would say
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        - What does it do was
        - they're looking for
        - It's not capitalized like your name, Jazmin's capitalized, Chris is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not
        - But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer
        - And that is the name
        - So in the text
        - It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits
        - However, I think that they have a plan for the water
        - and based off the paragraphs as Chris said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons
        - So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate
        - It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope
        - What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely
        - Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine
        - It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use
        - I don't really think they could have
        - So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are?
        - But if we were to choose one answer to be correct
        - However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there
        - I would probably go with the lunar orbit
        - That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it
        - And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon
        - we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        - So that's where you found about the microscope
        - I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there
        - Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?
        - So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something
        - You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water
        - However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope
        - Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water
        - But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water
        - Like Farrah, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter
        - Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes Chris
        - yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter
        - But the last passage has our answer in it
        - Do you, you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water I think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators
        - yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose
        - is to travel around the moon and discover
        - So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent
        - Those are some options
        - Yes, Jazmin
        - That is, that is correct
        - So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water
        - Does anyone have any questions about that?
        - but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign
        - So yeah, you're right
        - They did send a small machine, but just so everybody knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon
        - So there's actually two answers
        - So that's another tool
        - So if we look in the reading
        - We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use
        - is actually called a microscope
        - And that's what actually finds the water
        - yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water
        - when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water
        - that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water
        - So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too
        - um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes Jazmin
        - but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter
        - or microscopes when looking for the water
        - When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter
        - And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter
        - So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture
        - But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter
        - Oliveron? I mean Oliver, sorry
        - And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope
        - So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening

  examples: |
        - Okay, so whenever we're reading We want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question
        - So as we're reading, if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking
        - You can use that strategy over and over for the rest of your life
        - To all future questions in the text
        - What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
        - So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question
        - And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do
        - And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us
        - You are correct
        - So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific,
        - So now that you've figured out the full answer
        - What will you do next time to when you're looking back in the text
        - Alright so next time
        - Go back and look in the story to find your answer
        - so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better
        - And how you will apply what you learned in your next task so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering
        - So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second Luis, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question
        - we're just going to go around Jazmin, what do you think first you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task
        - And last but not least, Farrah What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
        - So next time you answer a question like that
        - What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using,
        - Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at all, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge
        - Right that's good that's why we're in school right because we don't know everything I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write
        - Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are all the way there yet
        - So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information
        - Right, so you went back and read
        - What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
        - I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this
        - I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook
        - And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future
        - That's excellent
        - So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text all the information there
        - So next time we have, we're answering
        - Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do
        - Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text
        - What are you going to do that
        - And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy
        - You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence
        - Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay
        - Specific name and of the things that you described okay
        - Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question
        - We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion
        - or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these
        - Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question
        - And what about that, and when you guys are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?
        - So what do you think you would do next time to
        - What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?
        - what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text so here i'm going to give you a new question if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question you ready?
        - How, what did you learn right What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this person
        - Great Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine
        - So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers
        - Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
        - Okay, what could you do next time
        - What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
        - Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said
        - How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down
        - Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question
        - Hi Welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it i'm Jazmin as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, yes, Ehtan
        - So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and
        - So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text
- intent: r430.3
  examples: |
        - Okay, so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph
        - So let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question
        - Does that make sense
        - Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon
        - So instead of oxygen tanks
        - Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment
        - See ifyou can find equipment that helped scientist, the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water
        - That's a key word in the question is equipment
        - This time, can you also look and see if you can find the equipment
        - Does that make sense?
        - Okay, so you are right NASA did send a small machine, but instead of looking for the machine
        - So we're looking
        - Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon
        - Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment
        - The same thing applies for yours
        - Okay, so they did that is true, they did find water on the moon, but now
        - And you using context clues to find that exact name for that equipment
        - But they also had to use the more specific tool to look at the water itself
        - So yeah, you guys all had similar good answers, but you wanted to dig a little deeper to find the exact answer
        - But that's not what they used to discover it
        - Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon
        - Can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water
        - Can you go ahead and look there and give me a response
        - I just want to make sure we understand
        - So maybe in the future use that information
        - But just make sure inside of whatever given takes that you have that you take it, maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that
        - So what it's asking
        - But not necessarily applicable to this specific text
        - I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher
        - It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time
        - question if you're confused and look closely at the passage
        - If you look at what the positives are it might outweigh the time that it takes, so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon  so Farrah can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon
        - But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon, if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used
        - So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks
        - But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question
        - So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also
        - But I do not believe that was in the article itself
        - So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior
        - I want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for that specific answer that you need
        - But I am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text
        - Do you want to try that
        - I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words
        - What I'd like you to do, though, is look a little bit closer in the reading
        - I want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that shows what tools they use
        - So as you're reading and you're making those real world connections
        - So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon?
        - I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water
        - How they would get to the water on the moon
        - So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon, why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water
        - But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right, and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water
        - But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text
        - But you want to base your answer off of the reading you don't want to go off on your own path, just in case it isn't right now, you might have thought it was one thing, but it's not actually what it is, so you want to face what you see in the reading and then put that into your answer
