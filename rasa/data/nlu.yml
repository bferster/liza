        - Okay, thank you Luis. we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes.
        - Well, Luis. Why don't we, why don't we listen to Farrah answer and then we'll talk about your answer in just a minute. Okay?
        - yep, exactly. you said it perfectly. yeah.
        - So, Jazmin, you told me that NASA sent a small machine, right?
        - tool called a microscope
        - Okay, that's fine. Yeah, we'll go around the room and when I get to you, I'll let you ask your specific question. Okay.
        - It's right on to that. Hold on just a minute and
        - Okay, perfect. All right, Jazmin. I really enjoyed reading your response.
        - Great. Those are two important aspects to focus on. 
        - Um, I'll me let me look down, um, water on the moon. Yeah, water on the moon.
        - Chris. I'm going to work with you independently in one minute. Okay.
        - Uh huh. Okay, um,
        - Yeah, yeah.
        - Microscope. Ok.
        - That's what I was gonna say too.
        - yeah, you guys, you did awesome. Great. okay.
        - And I see that you answered scientist use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks.
        - Alright, perfect, you take a minute, while I go over to Chris.
        - um, yeah, so I circled the same answer as Savanannah and that's a microscope.
        - you're right.
        - What equipment scientists use to discover the water on the moon, but all of our other observations were also really close so.
        - We take a bath here, and we drink water a lot. And I was remembering what Luis and Chris were talking about. And yes, you need water to live. And so yes, that's what I was thinking. Yes.
        - Okay.
        - Oh really, that is awesome.
        - So thinking about the tools that the scientists use to discover water on the moon, I know you guys mentioned lots of different equipment, the oxygen tanks, the lunar orbiter, the microscope, sometimes they just found it in craters. 
        - Story. So, Jazmin said NASA send a small machine. Okay, so I love how you did that. 
        - Oh, oh, OK, OK, um, oh well. It's actually it's time for us to go to lunch, so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch.
        - That's a very good point.
        - I thought it was pretty cool, you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people, you know, if we, if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there, so yeah.
        - huh, yes, and a couple of you guys did revise your answers, and you did a great job with that revision. 
        - And Jazmin. I love that you mentioned the Lunar Orbiter, 
        - Perfect.
        - hi Jazmin. I see you've got your hand.
        - That is very
        - Well said. It is a tool, you're correct. So let's write, let's write that down. I'll keep that in note and I'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had. But thank you for volunteering. 
        - Exactly, so we can always write that too. I think your answer right now is just as good though. Good job.
        - Good, good. Good job. I like that. I like that. could reply Jazmin, I see your hand up.
        - Yes, and survey, Anna.
        - Oh yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt. I know this was really, really short, and we just met, but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch. But I really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us, and I mean I didn't say anything, but you really listen to everybody sharing their ideas, and that was really nice. Thank you.
        - Thanks Chris. Oliver?
        - is called know the Lunar Rover I think.
        - Uh, so, for example, a Farrah, you put that you need a scientific tool called a microscope. Now,
        - I'm glad you said you know a lot about space. So that means something that probably interest you a lot.
        - Yeah. Yes. I could see how you say that yes
        - I see, that I understand. um let's move on to Chris, and then Oliver I'll come back to you if you're still confused by the end of it okay.
        - Farrah, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope.
        - My answer, my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that OK.
        - Yes. Yes.
        - Amazing. Yes. 
        - Yes, that's a really good answer. Thank you. Yes, mean you are right.
        - Good. Good answer. Thank you. 
        - Yep, just give me a moment Oliver. I'm going to have everyone. Think about it for 15 more seconds, then I'll come to you. Okay.
        - Okay, Harisson, what, you had your question, a question just a few minutes ago. What was that question that you had?
        - Yeah, that was a big question.
        - Okay, your answer, no. It's not ready yet.
        - Thanks for thanks Jazmin I appreciate that.
        - You are correct. Very good. 
        - I'm going to go over to Jazmin, since we're low on time, Jazmin. You had your hand up. What were you gonna say
        - Right you're right Farrah. so let's look.
        - so like Farrah and Oliver you guys said that you needed a scientific
        - Okay, thank you for that input. Okay. 
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter was used to investigate.
        - Right.
        - So I was I'm still I'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong, but I can't tell you what I was thinking. So basically, when I looked at the text like I saw
        - um.
        - So now let's look at your responses. So Farrah you circled the same thing as Chris, and so, you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now I mean.
        - I kind of was thinking about what Farrah and Oliver were saying. And I was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what I mean, like, maybe you need a microscope to see
        -  um yeah I, I also think it's valuable because if you split the water like I said i'm.
        - yeah you did a really great job.
        - So Chris, you said that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so, um, I circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - rocket fuel. That's right.
        - Good. Great memory, word for word exactly what the question was. Great job.
        - that's a great definition Thank you so much Luis 
        -  yeah that's what it says in the story.
        - Um I learned to make sure that I read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear.
        - That is awesome. Thank you for sharing that. 
        - Yeah, I can add this is Jazmin.
        - You know all about space?
        - Chris and Jazmin. Let's look at yours. You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - So I said that NASA used like a small machine
        - There you go. Okay, Chris, what did you want to add?
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what Farrah had said.
        - Yes, Chris, so on. That's awesome. Again, that you that you're reading about space. And that's awesome that you're excited about that. 
        - And that is a piece of equipment yeah.
        - So we'll start with Farrah I your response was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - yeah okay.
        - Mostly the same stuff. All right, good. 
        - Thank you, Farrah, for sure. Chris.
        - So she said, you need a scientific tool called a Microsoft to look really closely. 
        - Like, not a lot of it, maybe
        - Okay we'll leave that there Jazmin you have a question or a comment.
        - Yeah.
        - Oliver that's awesome that's perfect that's a great sentence and you got great answers.
        - So Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to work really closely. Yes. Luis
        - Okay, that is the name of the small machine.
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - It's one of the right answers. Yeah.
        - I understand that you had a similar response to Farrah.
        - That is perfect clapping for you, that is awesome Thank you perfect alright Jazmin.
        - Okay, thank you.
        - Okay, great awesome.
        - Well, that was, I'm sorry. This was Farrah. That was my answer from the beginning
        - i'll get right to you in just a minute.
        - I love that and your response was very interesting and we're going to we're going to talk about each one okay.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it. Okay, it's in the beginning, it says future astronauts could drink this water.
        - I'm really proud of you guys for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - yeah you so you feel you're all good.
        - So, it flies flies through space.
        - The water.
        - Yes, exactly.
        - Thank you so much.
        - Right. Nice job.
        - that's true okay so that's a very interesting fact 
        - Um, I think I would be convinced to maybe if it wasn't so hard to get the water and also from the first part, if there was more water because it said there's only like
        - That is cool.
        - Who else would like to share
        - Exactly.
        -  Oh so is anybody using a microscope.
        - So I circled the same as Farrah, and we both thought it was the microscope.
        - OK.
        - Yes, very good so again, it would be but.
        - know Farrah your response was you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly.
        - Absolutely you're totally right,
        - I said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two.
        - um yeah I change my answer too. 
        - Yes that's one example, that is an example of a piece of equipment.
        - yeah and you you're correct Farrah you did do that um.
        - Oh yes, that is where exactly it says that the ice deposits are very small,
        -  um well I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now.
        - Awesome, thank you for sharing. I want you...
        - Thank you for your input, Luis But I just asked Farrah a question. Would you mind letting her respond?
        - On yeah I guess I just wanted to say this, like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important.
        - so what I chose. I think I know the words, but I was wondering about equipment because I basically said the same thing as Farrah. What was that it was the microscope.
        - yeah that's very true they use a lot of a lot of high tech tools like computers and.
        - Excellent.
        - Um, yeah. So what I was thinking was when I was looking through the reading. I was seeing like so in the in the question. 
        - Okay great, it's not needed. 
        - No teacher i'm sorry but it's actually time for us to go.
        - That's a good feedback. Yes, you can.
        - Absolutely, and that shows me that you really understood the text and what everybody's saying and before we move on intimacy you have your hand up, but before I answer you.
        - yep exactly Jazmin a lunar orbiter good job 
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - awesome that is a really great response so.
        - Right so perfect Chris.
        - Thank you alright Jazmin so, you said that NASA sent a small machine now.
        - I'm happy that you were able to learn from each other.
        - Well, first of all Chris I would just like to say, that's awesome. Um,
        - Oh good. Good job. Great job. All of you guys, I appreciate all of you guys volunteered to read, and you've all done a very good job. OK. So let's get through, if, do you guys have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil?
        - Microscope.
        - Yeah, so it's it's certainly mentioned that
        - It doesn't totally relate to water, but that is a really cool fact 
        - I'm sorry, what's the answer.
        - Thank you for that information. Chris.
        - Farrah. You said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, that's really cool.
        - Yeah thanks for sharing that. 
        - Okay awesome.
        - So that's, that's good to know. Okay, so you have attempted to answer the question, which is good. Okay.
        - yeah you're absolutely right, so we talked about that.
        - That is correct. All right, Chris Chris you your response says water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. 
        - Yeah, I think microscope as well. And it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading. 
        - yep 100% true Luis.
        - Yeah, maybe I guess we'll have to wait and see. Right, yes Oliver.
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Was my answer. That's what I said that the scientists found craters full of water.
        - um so, unfortunately I know it was a really short time, but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and.
        - Yes, you are completely right that there is, there's a lot to kind of dissect in this. So you're right.
        - All to turn teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Lunar orbiter. That is correct.
        - And so that's why I thought it was the answer. Because in the text. Oh, I remember one thing I remember
        - Luis So you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks your responses. Very good. And though. 
        - Hmm, okay. So your answer was, I'm going to look back at at the answers you guys bad. So I'll go back to submit. So that is the answer the question for us, but I'll come to yours.
        - I think that's a great question and I don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it.
        - but for time we're gonna move on over to Luis.
        - You're right. That is a really good answer. So the as that.
        - Um, well, I was just gonna say like I i only underlined.
        - Ms. Teacher, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, you know, this was really short, and we just met, but I really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers.
        - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch
        - Thanks.
        - i'm teacher, I looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um, but I do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and.
        - Oliver you, you had a similar response, you said that no it's not not ready yet so maybe.
        - Well, the water on the moon. The story said it's so small you can't see it.
        -  Thank you.
        - yeah exactly 
        - Yeah, no problem.
        - And in fact, yet. Luis You keep on looking for that.
        - That's very good. That's very good. 
        - I think that is, I think that is an excellent definition and that actually makes me think of something different that maybe helps my understanding.
        - That was a great response so see how.
        - Wow. That is really cool. I love all of those answers. 
        - That's very good. Oliver?
        - We would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Um, well, I just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - I think you're correct. Absolutely. Great job.
        - All right, so let's start with Farrah Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - They do the they do use oxygen tanks uhmm.. 
        - Yeah
        - So if we could start with Jazmin he said NASA send a small machine, could you tell someone.
        - Jazmin that's a great word, you know i'm gonna write that down to make sure that I remember that discover.
        - Good.
        - A hack.
        - Yeah, yeah. Okay.
        - Okay, so that's the answer.
        - yeah oh yes you're right why why we need to live on the moon.
        - Wonderful. Give me, give everyone just a moment.
        - okay.
        - Um, thank you Farrah you are very close. 
        - All right, thank you so much for sharing that Farrah did I see you raise your hand Chris.
        - Okay. Alright, so let's find out. 
        - That was me that was me I also had that same idea.
        - Good job, Luis. So once you reread it, you found a different answer correct?
        - Alright so Farrah, you mentioned in the text that scientists use a tool called a microscope.
        - Well, I can see that it's time for us to go to lunch, and I know it was really sharp, but I do appreciate how you told us that we have. We just have to look and look again and look even closer at the story to find more information, I guess so.
        - Oh, okay.
        - Alright, okay. And then Chris, you talked about how they found craters
        - Yeah, I could do that.
        - Oh Oh, I thought you could only have one answer.
        - It makes me think I guess my question is, like, I've been to NASA with my dad and we saw that like there was like masks and suits and stuff that astronauts or. I was wondering like why that's not in the reading.
        - That's good.
        - Great
        - you're getting closer.
        - Okay, well if you hold on to that. And while I talked to some of the others. 
        - Awesome.
        - Men Jazmin, you said NASA send a small machine and then Luis You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Alright, so
        - So let's go ahead and talk about it. Okay.
        - Yes. Nice job. Oliver. 
        - Alright, so we'll come right back to you Jazmin, how can I help you.
        - Very good.
        - Exactly exactly. yeah Oliver go ahead.
        - I can
        - Oh yeah, I totally well
        - So Farrah, you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely.
        - yeah sure do.
        - that's cool down for that.
        - that's great 
        - And that happens.
        -  so thank you for being our first brave volunteer to share thanks Jazmin.
        - so I think you circling discover is a great Just a great choice for yourself.
        - Okay, so you noticed the mention of craters and so with water on the moon. 
        - i'm still confused.
        - I dont know, maybe.
        - Okay, so you still think that lunar orbiter is a good job. Oliver do you have a question.
        - Okay, you said that scientists found craters full of water in the moon.
        - Yeah, I have that same answer.
        - yeah.
        - Interesting okay so.
        - Yeah, I thought that was so cool.
        - Yeah. You just told Farrah that was the right answer.
        - Farrah I see you i'm going to come back to you once i'm done with Chris 
        - Very good that's exactly right 
        - Those are awesome answers, and I was great job, knowing that i'm waters chemical was h2o that was awesome Jazmin what's up.
        - yeah from the story that we read exactly Chris.
        - In the craters, perfect. OK, and--
        - Oh that's a great answer Chris.
        - All right. So you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look more closely.
        - We so.
        - And Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah.
        - Good good final answer.
        - Great.
        - You're right, you're right.
        - Right, okay. So you could have the water to drink, but if you look back at the sentence Chris gave us
        - Yeah, so really cool thing 
        - Okay, well, there may be somebody here that does so let's all just take our turns and we'll see where it goes. Okay?
        - Okay, very good observation. While you were reading. Good job Chris.
        - I agree.
        - Well, I mean, yeah. What I liked about, you know, like my answer, um, which Farrah had the same one true, um, was that the question asked her about, um, let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool.
        - I have a quick question.
        - You're okay. Thanks, Jazmin.
        - um you need oxygen tanks to be on the moon.
        - Allright class just to recap for my own sake I believe we went over Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin. You hopped back in believe Chris, you just had a question. Luis hold on just one moment 
        - Evidence. So what so evidences one. 
        - Equipment. Yes, that's great. And Oliver?
        - Oh, that's really cool.
        - That was something super interesting. Right.
        - Definitely um yeah, Oliver. 
        - I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - We can breathe oxygen.
        - I think I got it this time.
        - Jazmin are you ready i'm ready awesome so, you said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Very nice. Who wants to read the second second paragraph.
        - Um no I corrected that let me see. I'm looking to see if I can find it.
        - Uh huh.
        - Well, well, I was gonna say like they use it for
        - Right. A, then, what were you gonna say
        - Excuse me, Ms. Kelsey?
        - awesome and Oliver and I know that you and Farrah were working together Oh yes, I see your hand go ahead.
        - Okay, well, I would love to hear that information that you can give us from this question that we've kind of want to talk about now. Okay.
        - Thank you. Who else would like to share what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And I'm so sorry. Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. But we wanted to thank you so much for working with us. It was really fun to work with. Thank you.
        - Awesome job. Thank you for sharing. All right, Miss Farrah. What did you underline and paragraph two?
        - So good answer to or like how different everyone's answers were and I felt that you all explained what the tools were used for in a perfect way.
        -  Farrah, you said you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely I lock that answer. ALL RIGHT. Dave, you said you circle, the same thing as Farrah.
        - Chris.  You're doing a great job of listening.
        - rocket fuel.
        - Great. I'm glad you were listening Farrah. You did a great job. 
        - I also said microscope. Right. Yeah.
        - That the first sentence or two. And I was like, I basically was looking at like the small and I just want like I still don't understand why my answers.
        - Okay, very good. 
        - Um, yeah. So I guess I wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you, you could use. So like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick. You know what I mean like it could be sensors. It could be other things.
        - All right, so great connections. I love this. 
        - actually let's go on to your answer. I'm going to read it for everybody so we can remember says scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, thank you. Yeah, that's a really good question and answer. 
        - Well,
        - No, 
        - Um, yeah, I agree with Farrah. I also saw equipment and I thought like water too was maybe an important word.
        - Okay, who would like to read the second one.
        - Okay, so when I look and small machine. She basically I was looking in paragraph two and I was in the first sentence.
        - Okay, okay, I'm
        - Great. We'd love to have you, Luis.
        - Fair enough. Yes, Luis
        - Okay, no worries. So, Jazmin, you said that NASA send a small machine to the moon. Right.
        - Very good, Jazmin. Does everybody else agree with her answer?
        - Yeah, okay.
        - Awesome. So I noticed Farrah, as you said that, um, scientists use this specific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Good. You need tools to see them.
        - That is a good question.
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, that's great. And Oliver, I noticed that you said that you circled the same as Farrah.
        - I love that then we could have moon flowers.
        - Yeah, it's, it's in the first sentence where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I said NASA sent a small machine.
        - Okay, okay, I'm moving on to Oliver. 
        - Yeah. What a good observation. I love that. 
        - Oh yeah that's really interesting Jazmin do you want to quickly share what you have said.
        - Okay, let me let me talk with Jazmin for just a moment and I'll come back to you. Okay.
        - But yes, your first portion of the answer that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. That's very important.
        - That. Okay. So I think that it's this small machine
        - Okay, so I thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um I I don't understand why my answer is wrong because I thought the microscope discovered it, and also the yeah I thought the microscope discovered the water
        - Farrah, I completely agree with you, I also was very surprised I did not know that there was water on the moon, so this text was very illuminating for me that I learned something new.
        - Could you let it Chris finish his sentence and then you could go next.
        - Exactly. That's perfect.
        - So Oliver so what I noticed by saying you know by you saying that I circled the same thing as Farrah.
        - Okay. Oh, thank you so much teacher for really helping us by by telling us the things that we did do well and then I'm like helping us to look back at the story again to find our answer.
        - Right exactly.
        - Yes. Alright, so let's see what Chris wrote. He recently wrote scientists found craters full of water on the moon, 
        - Yeah, I, I kind of had that like because I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading. But oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that.
        - Alright, I see some head shakes. those are both really great definitions that we got from Luis and Farrah.
        - Right, and that's Luis That was your point. Right.
        - how about the rest of you did what did we say for this question that we'd like to share with the rest of the group.
        - that's awesome um so how about we just like put a quick pin it, we're going to come back to this microscope idea. the microscope is a really great tool that lots of scientists use.
        - Well, I had answered no.
        - Okay, I see your machine called the Lunar orbiter.
        - First, Farrah, I see what you were saying.
        - So Farrah, you said you end up both said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Good job, Jazmin.
        - Okay, yeah. So just sit there and listen to Farrah and then we'll get to you in just a sec. All right. Go ahead Farrah
        - Oh, interesting. Okay, so I love everyone's answers to these 
        - Okay, so thank. Thank you very much. Chris for sharing. So thank you. Thank you for contributing. 
        - Okay, that's a good response. 
        - Jazmin, you are correct. They don't talk about the lunar orbiter in the third paragraph, but we have Luis's answer.
        - Ah, there we go. Okay.
        - Okay, very good. All right, now and Chris, the you know the defining the words that you're not sure of.
        - Um, yeah. So I said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen.
        - My answer is that i'm okay it's.
        - Chris, can you hold that thought for just one moment.
        - Okay, the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        -  You yeah yeah it's valuable, I think, having more money, the spacecraft's definitely valuable.
        - I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Oh yeah, okay. It could be, but we were on the right path as well and I fantastic job that you're doing. 
        - We will go over your answer in a few minutes right now we're focusing on Oliver but i'll have time for you to explain your thinking.
        - Okay, we will get to that in just a second. 
        - Yeah I know all about it.
        - All right, well, that's awesome. 
        -  yeah I found my answer in the first paragraph.
        - Great john Chris, awesome teamwork everybody. So let's go back to the text. Farrah and Oliver, you circled the part about the microscope 
        - Acknowledges but does not engage with response (e.g., "Interesting, good job")
        - Yeah, so that was certainly one, one way to do it. 
        - No Jazmin. You did a good job. Your answer is great. The first time.
        - that's so great.
        - Good job, and they're awesome you guys. Really good job. Thank you all for sharing those specific equipment with me. You guys did a really good job.
        - Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon.
        - You're absolutely right
        - Okay, while are you looking for. I'm going to talk with the other four. OK.
        - Not like I really love space and my dad has taken me to NASA before. So I think I know the words pretty well.
        - Okay, very good. So two words that we have identified so far, Jazmin. Did you find a word.
        - You did you had that they used
        - Okay. The word this cover. Okay, let me hear some other ideas. What word did you choose Oliver?
        - Um, and I think another real benefit here. Luis you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and Jazmin knocked it out of the park.
        - Okay, thank you for that Jazmin i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so I Jazmin really quick, I just wanted to go back to Farrah for a little bit 
        - You happen to know what the lunar orbiter is. I feel like you have a little bit of surface up.
        - Chris I see your hand, will call on you next. 
        - yeah I think we're still a little confused cuz we were thinking, how could you discover something if you can't even see it, why don't you need the microscope and order to find it because it's so small.
        - Oh, thank you.
        - Okay so Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. I think that that was a really great answer in response to the reading and the question.
        - No problem.
        - Jazmin's right, she's not wrong.
        - I appreciate you guys coming in today you've all done a very good job.
        - Absolutely not. See you said you circled the same thign as Farrah.
        - I answered the same as Farrah.
        - Mm hmm. Yes, that's correct. I could see how you could come up with that answer
        - yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords.
        - Yeah Luis.
        -  I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mask and suits.
        - Yeah, and it was similar to what Luis said
        - I think that's a wonderful response, um,
        - When you said, the tool the scientists needed for water was a small microscope um.
        - And then I'm gonna get back to you. 
        - That's a very good answer. Thank you. Farrah. 
        - Um, so I was just gonna say like that basically I can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like Jazmin said, did they have astronauts in it? Did they need all that stuff?
        - Okay. Your answer was actually really close. So you did have the small machine is what you said.
        - Okay, very good. Farrah. And what about you.
        - yeah that's perfect in fact that that brings us over to eton's point in in Chris your point about science is finding craters full of moon on the water.
        - mm hmm.
        - You are right about that.
        - So yes, so tell you told me that.
        - Okay does anyone else have a response, thank you Luis.
        - Okay, so here's what i'm hearing so much about your experience going to NASA and I definitely want to hear more about that.
        - Let me see. It investigated.
        - exactly they use those to find them on the moon
        - that's exactly right that's exactly right, so you know we have this lunar orbiter yes Oliver. 
        - Okay. And I know that's that's
        - Excuse me teacher
        - Thank you for your connection Jazmin and for adding more detail and Chris. Thank you for sharing your thinking and for telling us what the text is mostly about. 
        - Exactly that's a great observation Nathan, and a growth strategy to continue with.
        - Oh yeah.
        - Yeah, so that's one of the purposes that they That they pointed out.
        - They did so we're going to look at the next paragraph after that paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth.
        - I believe so, yes.
        - Okay, but I'm glad reading the text and you notice microscope was in there 
        - Okay so Oliver and Luis than right he got the right idea. Yes Oliver.
        - Possibly. Who knows but that would be really cool now. 
        - Oh good. That's really good. Thank you for contributing that.
        - Now, Farrah and Deb, you obviously have the same idea 
        - Um, well, actually. Yeah, I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now.
        - Very good. 
        - sounds pretty dark.
        - You could use all of the equipment, but like, specifically, you said to discover. So I guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover, you'd have to use something else. Right.
        - You said that they use lots of equipment. Right.
        - Okay, Jazmin. Let's look at your, your answer says, NASA sent a small machine, right.
        - yeah Thank you so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch I just want to say that I know that our time was really short.
        - I said water again this time because I think that's what the whole thing is about
        - awesome OK OK.
        - yeah that could be pretty cool.
        - yeah i was gonna say find.
        - Yeah microscope is like a tool.
        - Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah.
        - Yeah, I said the same thing.
        - You guys have lots of great questions, and I think you know a little bit more than I do, even about what's going on up in space, but they definitely my I think that's in like I said for Jazmin that's a great question to write down that we can look into as we talk more about.
        - Nevermind, I'll wait.
        - Oh, that's something that we can look at together in some of our other stories whenever we start studying a little bit more on this.
        - Okay yeah discover good 
        - And the first one I went like talk to his Chris with your question.
        - that's a great point Farrah so thank you for pointing out why it can be kind of tricky to answer questions like this 
        - Water great that's another awesome word in our question.
        - Yes, ma'am.
        - I went to NASA. So I know that's high does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.
        - yep definitely true.
        - Good, I'm glad I could hear your own words. 
        - Um, yeah. So I pretty much said the same thing as Farrah, and I circled the same area.
        - Jazmin: Okay. Go me. 
        - That's cool. 
        - um yeah well, excuse me um I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - hmm um what are you thinking Farrah.
        - equipment awesome you're right, you're right.
        - Alright, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - And what it is, is a small machine called an orbiter.
        - Yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah, that's really interesting. But that's not really quite part of our reading but that's really-        - it's something interesting to share with the class. I'm really glad you shared that. 
        - That is true.
        - Let's go and see what someone else said before we get back and talk about whose answer is correct. Oliver, do you want to give your answer.
        - Okay, Jazmin, what do you think
        - Yes. And you're right, and then also Luis also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split.
        - Um, yeah, basically the same as Farrah, and for me like I was thinking about science equipment and discover, and so I also think that like it has to do, especially with the microscope. 
        - um well I kept the part I put about NASA cuz that's in the story too so.
        - So let's hear from one other person, and then we can talk more about your concern, is that okay?
        - right they do.
        - A very good way to look at that.
        - Oh, yes. Sorry. Wrong student. I said the wrong name.
        - yeah, of course, and that's going to come back again later, when we talk about our next question.
        - Yes.
        - Okay, so you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen and what I like about.
        - It's a dark, dark place. Farrah, do you want to share too?
        - And you said that they use a microscope so
        - Okay, so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, congratulations, you should be very proud of your dad.
        - There you go. Very good. That is correct. So that is the answer that we're looking for. Jazmin. Thank you.
        - OK. That's a good answer. It may not happen for a long time. 
        - Thank you for sharing.
        - Well, you might not need help, but you might be able to help me help the rest of the group
        - Alright Farrah and great job and are you guys worked as a partner.
        - I agree that that's that's crucial piece of information for us here on earth to you, none of us can survive without water for sure.
        - Perfect so now that we've taken the oh yes.
        - I just use Jazmin's machine that NASA centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon.
        - Okay, so we have, it's heavy. And we have the we believe us not valuable yet Jazmin.
        - Yeah, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us. Um, it was really cool to have you like helping us. So thank you so much.
        - Good Lunar Orbiter. Good. Good. And or another way you could say that would be, that's a very good answer. You could even say like
        - Great awesome good job i'm so.
        - Jazmin, so your answer is NASA send a small machine.
        - Okay, great.
        - And Oliver for you, you just said that you have the same answer as Farrah.
        - That's great.
        - Yeah, that's, that's definitely something that could happen if there was enough water on the moon. I wanted to speak with you about. I'm thinking about how
        - we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you.
        - And I think, Oliver you had said the same thing is Farrah. Right.
        - Sorry Teacher I just, I just thought of one more thing.
        - So, I went to NASA. So like I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff, like I already know about all that stuff.
        - Absolutely. Thank you for sharing now.
        - Very good. Luis Thank you for reading that again for us. 
        - Yes, that's awesome. And maybe at another time. We can talk about your experience and you can share that with the class. I think that they would learn a lot for me.
        - I thought about.
        - You said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Yes, one second. And I will be so happy to hear. Let me just finish up with Farrah first. 
        - yeah Chris, I had a similar, but I did not know that they could find water on the moon
        - Oh, okay. So I was thinking something a little different. And it's still from the text, there's still evidence. So it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money. So I think that
        - Excuse me, teacher, I don't think I should be in this group,I already know all about space.
        - Yeah, there is another important word in this question because we're, we're talking about finding water on the moon. Okay.
        - And I really value how Chris has talked about water being really heavy and it cannot be carried on ships anymore Chris, would you like it, yes samana.
        - Alright, thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers. I really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it. 
        - They do use a lot of other stuff like that. Um, so your answer. You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Oh, I was just gonna say the same thing. 
        - The microscope great.
        - Yes, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay, I'm Chris.
        - Asked about because that's what it says on a story.
        - Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question.
        - cool and you guys are just on time.
        - Oh, let's wait your turn, please.
        - Very good, thank you.
        - rocket fuel. So rocket fuel will be a use and Jazmin, you could drink it. You can use it to grow things. Chris?
        - All right, good job. That's very smart picking that up, 
        - A lunar orbiter awesome 
        - alrighty then you'll be able to explain your thinking to me as soon as i'm done talking to Jazmin all right.
        - that's a good start so um maybe.
        - Oh isn't.
        - And jab. You said that you circled the same as Farrah. Let's see.
        - Is tell me that we need a microscope to look really closely so.
        - That's okay.
        - Water into hydrogen and oxygen right.
        - Very good response. 
        - Sorry, I'm Farrah, you said microscope. Right.
        - Yeah. So let's go back to what Luis Do you have a question.
        - Well that's fair yeah that's definitely fair okay 
        - Now Oliver, you said that you circled the same thing as Farrah. Right?
        - Awesome. Alright, a microscope. 
        - I didn't really read very closely.
        - Savanahh, hold on, let Oliver finish, but that's okay
        - All right, so Chris let's talk about the answer you gave me to the question, so your answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yes, ice and ice deposits, yes Chris.
        - Good yeah I don't know why my answers wrong too.
        - Okay Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, great. 
        - I said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Um, yeah, okay. So for me, basically what I said. I said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where I got that from was, let's see, where did I oh oh okay, in paragraph five, purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay, fair enough Farrah you have a question.
        - Exactly. Good job, Luis. 
        - Okay. So you found that the craters are full of water. So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found. Right. Awesome. 
        - OK, well, if you think your-        - if you had the answer, then someone else who didn't have that answer want to try again.
        - You're right. Yes, there is a lot of equipment that gets used. 
        - Well, looking at your answers. Like I said all of y'all did a decent job. Hang on one second. Let me ask Chris, what do you, what do you ever say, buddy.
        - Okay, I see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two.
        - That's a great idea. I wonder if that could happen. We'll have to do some more research about that another time. Luis
        - Mmm good 
        - All right. Well, first off, I want to say thank you for for y'all guys reading water on the moon. I hope y'all thought it was pretty interesting.
        - And then your answer. Scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - that's really good information 
        - Right, so you told me that we can split up.
        - Luis I will answer your question in a minute. Thank you. 
        - Let's just hang out for a minute. Let's talk about some things. Okay.
        - I would yeah just to reiterate what I said.
        - I actually feel like I knew what each of the words meant.
        - that's a good point, yes, and last paragraph, I see I see um.
        - Absolutely. Thank you for using full sentences full complete sentences, full of correct grammar and all that nice capitalization. I appreciate that.
        - Oh, it's awesome. 
        - Yeah, exactly.
        - And so, Farrah and Oliver your answers are the same so you both said that they, the water is microscopic right.
        - Okay okay.
        - Alright class, so I heard all your answers and I thought you know I really liked how you put a lot of thought into it.
        - I have a question.
        - Chris, let's start with you. So you said scientists found craters are full of water on the moon. Right.
        - Let's have Oliver the chance to answer his question. Okay?
        - Okay, Chris, so scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - And then I want to talk, I also wanted to talk to Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - So, Farrah and Oliver, you find out-circled the microscope, right?
        - now I'm Jazmin, you said microscope. Right.
        - Basically I had to think. 
        - Yeah, absolutely. You're exactly right.
        - Microscope. Very good. I love how you found that in the reading. 
        - excited you know everyone forgets once in a while even I forget i'm so we'll move on to Jazmin.
        - yeah if that's what how the scientist goes and discovers water, yes, but again.
        - Okay Luis Let's hold on just a second. Keep your thoughts, just for a moment. Let's Jazmin, let's go back to each for just a minute. Tell me about your answer.
        - No, and so why don't we, why don't we answer my question first, and then I'll get right back to what you asked, okay?
        - I was gonna say I took it from the text
        - Okay, yes, good way it's super important.
        - That's really cool, Luis. 
        - yeah kind of.
        - And my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay that's that's an answer, how about you Luis What did you say.
        - Excuse me.
        - Okay, I like that answer.
        - Right that's very true.
        - Nice. Yes, that was really interesting. 
        - Um, yeah, I guess I'm still wondering like, cuz you know we're in the small group to try to help our answers like I guess I'm wondering like why my answer's wrong.
        - Oh, but, Miss Teacher I didn't have the microscope. I said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two.
        - That's a good answer. Farrah, what would you like to add to the conversation.
        - Boom. Very good.
        - Okay, good job Jazmin. 
        - So, Jazmin said NASA center small machine.
        - Oh yeah okay.
        - It was right? 
        - Um, wow, it's kind of more of a statement. Um, I think I should be in this group, because I know like all this stuff about space, like I practically know everything about space.
        - Great thanks Luis.
        - Luis said the Lunar Orbiter.
        - That's a good answer.
        - so Farrah. I love how you said you needed a scientific coats tool called a microscope.
        - Okay and I'm going to talk with Chris and Jazmin and Luis
        - Is that so?
        - yeah that's definitely what's so important about this right Chris thanks for sharing that.
        - I said that
        - Jazmin in your answer. I saw you, that you put NASA sentma small machine.
        - i'm sorry teacher, but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers.
        - teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say thank you for for helping us i'm really look for more details in the story, because I thought I did find everything but that one you said to read and highlight I found more.
        - thank you for that.
        - Okay, well, I circled discover.
        - that's excellent Oliver so glad that you're listening and paying attention in class.
        - And Deb, you had the same answer. Farrah. Didn't you
        - That's awesome. That is a perfect response. Good job. Farrah.
        - That's perfect.
        - Yes. So with the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Luis said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Correct. And that what the story tells us
        - You get alright so let's look at some of your answers and we have that Farrah and Deb, you had similar answers right you both said  You need something like a microscope to look really closely.
        - Faster gate to investigate.
        - I agree, and Jazmin did you want to add to that well.
        - Hi guys, first of all I want to say thank you so much for your hard work and all your responses.
        - Yeah, yeah. 
        - i'm sorry yeah um so actually I just looked at the clock um and we have to go to lunch, but.
        - Exactly Luis could you now respond and tell us your answer?
        - I'm going to ask Jazmin, a question first. So she's will me that NASA send a small machine Jazmin. 
        - Oh wow that would be really cool. 
        - I'm sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt teacher. I know this was really short and and we just met, but
        - Right, so that was a good lead Jazmin so thank you.
        - Okay, well, thank you Luis.
        - And here's an use its scientists film craters full of water on the moon.
        - So I'm Farrah. What I have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close.
        - They did yeah.
        - Exactly yes Farrah.
        - um I don't understand why our answer is wrong, why is microscope wrong.
        - um I could say
        - Oh um mine was kind of like what Chris just said, I said, scientists, they use oxygen tanks.
        - yeah yeah can I go.
        - Okay, and how about you Farrah
        - That's really cool. But let's get back on topic. 
        - Jazmin, you said that I sent a small machine. 
        - Luis can I have just a second.
        - Okay, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Well, I think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here.
        - That's wonderful. Chris and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like Luis had there and--
        - i'm going to come back to you and i'm going to come back to you to Luis 
        - I circle microscope too, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong. 
        - um, well Okay, so it sounds like the Lunar orbiter can find really small things.
        - Well, I guess I still think my answer is right, that NASA used a small machine to get to the water.
        - Yeah, yeah. I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer.
        - Your all on top of it.
        - So that we all did really well, I thought that I thought that i'm
        - Totally great job. Thank you. That was awesome.
        - Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope
        - They definitely need something to collect the water that's excellent Chris, 
        - Oh scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Alright.
        - Was very nice answer Jazmin. Thank you. All right.
        - So I want to go back to what Farrah was saying.
        - Your right
        - awesome.
        -  and then Davy said NASA sent a small machine and Luis said, scientists, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks 
        - yeah exactly and similar to what I said to the other two students.
        - You know what I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.
        - Okay, and like Luis said, oh, we can use them for rocket fuel.
        - yeah I mean it's really incredible to think about the progress we could make and all the discoveries, we can make.
        - Go ahead. I was just gonna Oliver and I have the same answer. I think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong.
        - Awesome. 
        - Yeah, that's right. My name is Oliver.
        - Let's move on. Let's move on to the name is tiny Oliver I believe I'm reading your name right. Is that right,
        - So that's not answer right just the small machine.
        - Well, can you tell me what the title of this was
        - Oh yeah I had the same answer as Oliver.
        - We'll use will use that enthusiasm here in just a minute. So bear with us for a little bit.
        - Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah.
        - Mhm. Yes. The water on the moon can be all kinds-        - used for all kinds of different things. 
        - Luis I see your hand, you can put it down. I'll get to you in just a minute. So you're not just standing there Holding it up the whole time.
        - I think, can you just let the Chris finishes answer and I will get back to you later.
        - That would be amazing I will do anything to do that.
        - awesome that's a great answer
        - Right, so that's a good point. So I do want to address that. So you said you've been to NASA. And you've seen lots of equipment that different astronauts and NASA scientists use.
        - That's pretty cool. 
        - Someone mentioned oxygen tanks in their answer.
        - That might be a good idea. 
        - yeah Definitely 
        - Yeah. Yes, I can see. Are you can you say that. Yes. Luis Do you have a question.
        - Okay, my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - They do have to use those spacesuits but well yes they do have to use them. And that's the only way they can be out there in space looking
        - All right, well i'm going to start with Farrah and then we'll come to your answer and we'll take a minute to take a look at it.
        - um yeah.
        - That's exactly
        - So you guys you in depth said no and then Jazmin and Chris said yes. And then Luis kind of gave some details. 
        - And Chris, you read your response was that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, very good. So he was at all. Okay, very good.
        - It would definitely be valuable, but not something that is feasible on that moon. 
        - Also Chris's answer. He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - And let's see, Farrah, you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely 
        - You were talking about the microscope?
        - I think that let's see what some other of your classmates circled as well, but I do think that your answer made complete sense when I was reading over the question,
        - awesome Chris.
        - yeah yeah that's what I said.
        - Awesome. Okay.
        - Awesome. Good job. That means just paying attention. I appreciate it.
        - I have written, I have that you put scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Is that what you put
        - And Chris even pointed out in your part that scientists found craters will have water on the moon. 
        - Um, and now that we've talked about it.
        - I got a different answer.
        - So Farrah said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Right?
        - Oh yeah, well I just actually I wanted to say that it's time for us to go, but I wanted to say thank you for having us. Look at that question so closely today.
        - Right. So looking at the other responses. I'm Luis I want to talk about your response. You said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Right.
        - So I liked your answers class I liked the line of thinking.
        - Ya so It says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's.
        - Very good. So we have a small machine called a lunar orbiter so Jazmin's answer  Was was right. Almost there
        - yeah well actually I went to NASA, so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay. So can anyone add on to what you just said.
        - excellent job you, you really enjoyed you really, really great you really impressed me with your answer I love, how you
        - OK. OK. So you guys did really good writing down an answer. I'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph. And that question and you answered it.
        - Right, yeah. It can be
        - As well Okay, you said, what do they use before the microscope and I guess, I guess, I don't really know I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - I did, I did read it. I did read it, I just I just kept thinking about all those like spacesuits and all that, you know.
        - That is fine. That is okay. 
        - Phenomenal. That's good. That's good. I'm proud of you. Um so,
        - awesome I think so too yeah Chris.
        - yeah yeah absolutely that's great.
        - So you all were the same. So when you def
        - that's correct the microscope is not on the moon. 
        - All right, so you said that NASA sent a small machine to the moon.
        - Sometimes i'm used to mess up but i'll go on to yours and your responses, yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water on.
        - yeah that was wild Chris,  anyone else read something that I thought was interesting.
        - All right, that is true. 
        - And you said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. 
        - yeah i'm still kind of confused.
        - Oh that's awesome.
        - The microscope.
        - For you fuel, which is what the as on Chris said that in 2024 they could have a gas station so being able to split up the hydrogen and oxygen efficiently would be very important, so you can have the breathing room and then the gas station.
        - Water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - So it's the lunar orbiter?
        - Luis said you said that water can be split into parts hydrogen and oxygen right
        - Yeah, they do. They, they have to use a ton of equipment. 
        - Um, so yeah. Okay, so what I know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything I know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff. If you're going to go up into space and like you're out.
        - um excuse me i'm i'm really sorry I don't want to interrupt but actually I just looked at the clock and.
        - Yeah, that's where we were. Yeah, we were on your answer. And your answer. I'll read it verbatim scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Perfect I will get right back to you after that okay okay perfect.
        - It was my first scoffing
        - Okay, thank you, thank you for sharing
        - Hmm, that's a good answer. Does anyone else have any any any ideas about that before we get into talking about it?
        - And Luis. Then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that Astronauts use. Awesome. 
        - that's also a really great idea Thank you so much Farrah for sharing that with us 
        - yeah actually I circled of equipment.
        - That your answer reads, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yes, they did. 
        - Good job.
        - Jazmin What did you pick.
        - Oh,
        - Um, yeah, I think, I think you have pretty good answer.
        - Wonderful. I'm so glad you're ready to help.
        - You did an awesome job to that.
        - Okay guys. Luis Can you hold your question for me for a couple minutes. 
        - Thank you, Farrah.
        - Well you guys did awesome today. Thank you so much and I will see you later.
        - Okay, thank you. Thank you Jazmin. Yeah, there is another important we're in this question. Okay. So coming back to you Farrah.
        - that's really cool and i'm sure we can circle back to that when we finish our discussion then we're just going to finish up first okay Chris.
        - Absolutely, what about you Jazmin.
        - That's very good. Good job.
        - Yeah, NASA does have
        - Oh that is just around the corner. That'd be pretty cool huh
        - Microscopic ice on the MOon
        - discover great that's definitely our action word discover.
        - Yes, equipment for discovering water. There's one more piece to that.
        - Well done. Oliver?
        - So, Jazmin, you said that NASA spit seeing a small machine. I love your answer that,
        - Well, I guess I was just wondering, kind of, I mean, kind of like Luis like I don't know. Like, I went to NASA with my dad and like we basically like went and studied all the exhibits and stuff so like I just know like outside of the reading that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff.
        - Could be valuable. Yeah. So let's see what Jazmin. Thanks.
        - Oh really,
        - um excuse me, I I have something to say.
        - Mm hmm. So that's something valuable about this water on the moon right even though it's microscopic. 
        - Luis noticed that in the passage is didn't mention astronauts 
        - Absolutely. Chris, what about you.
        - Ooh, that would be awesome. That would be really, really great. 
        - Okay well let's dive in a little bit, thank you, thank you guys, both for repeating the question, it's okay that it sounds similar. 
        - yeah i'm so proud of you, you would that really impressed me okay. Oliver i'm sorry, have you to wait for a while, so go right ahead, you have any question.
        - Well, you are correct on that.
        - Sure, thank you for your patience.
        - Just looked at your revised answers. And I do want to give you guys a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers. So very good job, um,
        - Jazmin.
        - I have to look again. Water could be useful in lots of ways. They could drink the water.
        - Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.  Jazmin said NASA send a small machine.
        - Exactly and um.
        - Great, okay. And Jazmin?
        - really great and Would you mind sharing with me is your name pronounced Hosni or Jazmin.
        - awesome Luis. 
        - Alright guys, I've heard some really great responses. You guys are doing a great job working together. Um, let's see. 
        - Yeah, okay. So we'll, we'll, we'll come back to that here in a minute. 
        - Okay, Jazmin.
        - Yeah, that would be awesome if we could do that. 
        - Well, I was gonna remind everybody that my dad is actually an astronaut. So that's pretty
        - Also another thing that I noticed. Oliver, I remember you said that you have the same answer as Farrah.
        - Oh, I don't know
        - All right, thank you for sharing that Luis let's dig into the question a little bit, then. 
        - Yeah yeah like I know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff.
        - yeah um I just looked at the clock, actually, we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say.
        - yeah that's definitely interesting to think about. 
        - Oh, okay. So you said that they needed a specific tool called the microscope.
        - I like your. That's a good answer. 
        - Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine. 
        - There you go.
        - yeah awesome so you identify and equipment 
        - yeah yeah great.
        - Okay, so that's, that's right. So you said that you would need a microscope to look really closely. 
        - That is perfect.
        - Why don't you. Let's go back to Jazmin and Luis over here while you're looking at that.
        - Yeah, because you need it. Look really closely.
        - equipment that's interesting okay so Farrah circled equipment
        - And Chris, how did you enter the question.
        - Okay. So we'll talk about that here in just a minute. Okay.
        - Wow, that's very interesting even but I'd really like you to focus on The article right now and then you can tell me more about that later.
        - Okay, very good. I could see how you could say that yes
        - Oh okay Oh, I see, let me hear other other people.
        - Thank you for that information, yes, I agree with you, I think it
        - Okay, so you, you said that they found the crater for water. 
        - So we could drink it.
        - And that's excellent. That's excellent.
        - I i'm so glad you're having so much fun, but what I want, I want to talk about your answer, so you told me that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - You know, they're working on it. Thank you. On Musk is doing great things so
        - yeah well actually Farrah I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits.
        - Yeah, they're definitely studying it in order to find the water, um,
        - Hi, So I saw your answers and, Jazmin, it really looks like you're onto something there.
        - Right that's also a good point Chris.
        - So I'm not real sure we would have to read more on that and see exactly how they used it and what they felt, maybe they discovered with it. So we might read another article and see what we can find out
        - Okay, perfect. That sounds great. 
        - Exactly. Wonderful.
        - Um, I actually, I was thinking, based on what you said, I was thinking maybe it was discovered. Well, so I'm still kind of
        - yeah I see you have great observations and can we think, can we help Farrah and Oliver figure out their answer first?
        - Okay, so I'm going to start by talking with Miss Farrah. So you said
        - Oh, I said that you need well I kind of cuz I thought that maybe my answer itself was Okay, so I just scratched out the microscope and put in the Lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool, called the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - Great job. Good.
        - Well, that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer. Farrah. So you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely. Right.
        - yeah they use a lot of equipment, so the research on things to find.
        - All right, thank you for your answers.
        - So I noticed Farrah that you talked about a microscope in your answer, that right. Yeah.
        - Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water 
        - discover that's also a good word.
        - All right.
        - That's, you know, that's interesting way to think about that question. 
        - Um, well, you're right.
        - yeah um I think that you mentioned that.
        - that's very cool that's very interesting 
        - Yeah, I, I found it on my own but since you had asked Farrah. First, I was just trying to say that I had the same answer, but I didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it.
        - yeah they do Chris.
        - Luis Luis said that NASA sent the Lunar Orbiter to discover
        - I'm, uh, but Chris, you mentioned that water is heavy.
        - Okay, so you said that you circled the same thing as Farrah.
        - Um, I think that would be valuable to. All right, let's see.
        - Yes. That's very true. Okay. Jazmin, what would you like to add
        - that's a good point.
        - Um, well I guess I mostly was thinking like about what I already do, so I guess I didn't read it that closely. 
        - You can definitely ask the teacher.
        - I love it. Great job, Farrah.
        - I said NASA sent a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - And so we've done a really great job going over the answers to the first question, 
        - So I, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yeah, that's really cool to Jazmin, what about you.
        - Good. Okay.
        - Hello friends Thank you so much for revising your responses to the question what equipment did scientists us to discover water on the moon so Farrah Chris and Luis, thank you for sharing your revised responses um Does anyone want oh yes Luis.
        - Yes. Absolutely.
        - Yeah. Thank you for pointing that out. It's, it's, um,
        - Interesting.
        - Oh yeah, you're correct. So yeah, we're going to discuss more of this later. 
        - Okay Okay, so we have a microscope that we can look at to see the teeny tiny water 
        - He said that I support my answer right.
        - Okay. Will you hold that in for a little bit and thinking about those spaces, maybe we can talk about that later.
        - All right, i'll let you think about that question, while I work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay.
        - We can start with you to say, you said that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Mm hmm. Good job. It is important. We do agree on that.
        - Yeah, yeah. When you asked us all a say or answer. So first, I'm not. I heard hurts. And it's the same thing that I found too.
        - Yeah. Yeah. That is correct. 
        - See that I'm glad you're still staying with our group, because that is some good insight.
        - yeah Thank you so much Jazmin 
        - Alright, so thank you so much for those responses, thank you for the hard work that you put in.
        - um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already corrected my answer.
        - Well, Chris, who do you agree with
        - Okay, so that's a great point. Luis can I help you?
        - And Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I know that Farrah, in fact did mention microscopes in her answer.
        - Great
        - rocket ships, they definitely need rocket ships.
        - NASA send a small machine.
        - Okay, well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay well give me one minute i'll keep, I'm going to tell Farrah what I want her to do and then i'm going to come to you.
        - Well Jazmin your answer was, NASA sent a small machine.
        - Alright, thank you so much. 
        - Right so y'all did an awesome job.
        - they're going to come back to that in just a minute.
        - You indicated that we would need a tool called a scien        - a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely.
        - So your answer was really, really, really great. And I really enjoyed it.
        - yeah i'm glad you find the differences and.
        - That is correct. They did send that. 
        - Oh, your answer is NASA sent a small machine.
        - yeah that's a great observation good job deb Thank you so much that's exactly the kind of answer we were looking for when we are trying to figure out.
        - yeah yeah right.
        - Luis I will get back to you in one minute. You can reread the passage right now.
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter investigated.
        - Yeah, perfect. 
        - Okay, very good. All right. 
        - Yes. Yes, that is correct.
        -  Chris, let me just get back to you quickly.
        - Well, I am glad that you know a lot 
        - So yeah, I think you guys did a great job with the text Oliver. Go ahead.
        - There you go. There's something small that they're looking at is the water. Good job.
        - Hey, that's okay. At least you were looking closely at your words why you were reading 
        - So you said that you need a scientific tool called the microscope to look really closely.
        - Her mm hmm okay.
        - Okay i got it, can I go.
        - That's true. I haven't read that, but I'll be sure to look it up. That's really interesting that I'm glad you brought that into the discussion.
        - Yes. Yes. That's the sentence I want you to read. Good job. Good job. So and in your answer, you'd said that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - that's true I agree that's a super that's really helpful for NASA.
        - By 2024 wow that is very interesting, we never had a base on the moon ever.
        - There you go. Great job guys. So each--
        - Um, so I was really interested in, like, I got like really about how be thinking, how cool it would be if you could grow this garden, that would be so pretty. 
        - Is awesome. Luis
        - that's great.
        - Okay, very good, very good.
        - You did some great reading Oliver.
        - so going to you i'll go to you next and then Oliver, I can talk to you.
        - Okay, okay, okay.
        - So, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. That's what you said. Yeah.
        - Yeah, I think for me, what was most interesting was looking at, like, was I think the fact that I've not been to NASA, a couple of times with my dad. And so I was connecting to everything. They were saying on because I I had kind of known some of it, but not everything.
        - It would be, you know, like it would take a long time.
        - Okay, that sounds great.
        - Nice job, Jazmin.
        - Thank you, Farrah appreciate that. Thank you so much. 
        - Alright, so I want us to take a pause. Great job Chris getting us started with that retell of the passage. 
        - Okay so Chris, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Let's see, you're right. You told me you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - I, I am. We go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for really thoughtfully work with us because you help me to understand like
        - Well, I'm so glad that you already have some prior knowledge of space. So I can't wait to hear about what you know about. But let's talk about the equipment that the scientists have used to discover water on the moon.
        - Luis Let's move back over here real quick before we hop over to Oliver I see your hand, you can put it down, 
        - Um I circled equipment too.
        - But each one of you did a fabulous job reading and looking at all the information and taking it in. So really good job guys. Very proud of each and every one of you. Yes, Chris.
        - Okay, so in order to do that, like in your response. You, you said they use the scientific tool called the microscope. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome job. 
        - Okay, good job, I guess, I can write that down okay.
        - Okay, very good. I love how you are also reading very closely and looking at the details in the story 
        - Absolutely.
        - So for now Chris for you, you said that scientists found water found craters full of water right?
        - Right. 
        - Really? So i'm trying to clarify Luis's answer, but I will move right on to you after okay.
        - Exactly right. Everybody see that
        - Maybe, maybe, maybe we can read another article. The next class about that topic, but I think that, yes, it's a very good topic. Thanks, Chris. 
        - Okay, very good. I love how you were reading closely to the tax Jazmin, what did you find in the text.
        - Um, yeah. So actually, um, so what I was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and, you know, stuff like that. Um, and then also, like, you know, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - that's great so that was good that as as a group.
        - So so so Oliver I noticed that you said that you circled the same as Farrah.
        - Farrah and Oliver I know you said that it
        - That's right.
        - Oliver you too.  You had agreed with Farrah.
        - I think you're on the right track. 
        - Good all right
        - And that's cool, you know that. So now I'm going to help another student.
        - All right. And then so Farrah, you gave a really good response. You said that use the
        - So i'm right too, it could be oxygen tanks, or microscopes, or lunar orbiter?
        - Okay, thank you Luis um okay so let's start. Farrah, you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right? Okay, Oliver, I think you said you had circled the same as Farrah, right?
        - I beat them and I say, ah, you can't do it as well as me and then I play the game and I get the most points and and I say you're a loser.
        - Macroscopic right
        - how about let's hear from somebody else anyone else, want to share out there and to our group.
        - Okay hold on just a moment. Okay.
        - Thank you. Okay, bye.
        - yeah that sounds great.
        - Um, yeah. So I was just gonna say like, I, I kind of already know. Like all about space and I don't really feel like I even need to be in this group.
        - you're off to a great start.
        - um yeah Okay, so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon.
        - Jazmin and Luis i'm going to get to you in just a second, I see that Farrah and Oliver have their hands up 
        - yeah we bought picked a microscope for the appointment.
        - Is moon right 
        - Very good. Who wants to read the last paragraph.
        - equipment great that's an excellent word to circle Thank you
        - So you said NASA send a small machine.
        - That you thought that they need a scientific tool called microscopes look really closely.
        - yeah that's a great answer Jazmin.
        - Yeah, you're exactly right. Luis There's so many different ways that astronauts can use water. It's such a valuable resource.
        - Thank you.
        - Well, that's aweseome. So maybe you can help us teach the others since you know
        - I chose discover.
        - awesome 
        - perfect and now Chris, I also wanted to talk to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay Luis I want to hear what you have to say it's so important, but I was still asking Farrah if she could build to her answer because I want to know if there's more to the article than just water on the moon. 
        - Mr. Lawrence, but I didn't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Oh, yeah sure.
        - that's Okay, and I think we will get there, but um yeah I really appreciate you trying.
        - Right, so. Okay, awesome. Yes Oliver.
        - That's good thinking Oliver. 
        - I think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water. And I was thinking, basically what you could do. Is you could use the water to grow things, you could have a garden on the moon, in the craters. 
        - And Oliver I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.
        - Yes, good the investigation part is good, let me look at the question again.
        - Gotcha. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. 
        - Okay, great response Chris.
        - Oliver said he circled the same as Farrah.
        - Okay, I like that answer a lot and Chris, would you like to add anything to that.
        - The action word.
        - yeah yeah I would love to so Okay, my answer and I actually this way, but I also saw in the reading because I did look at the reading this time teacher um I did look at it, and I saw that the water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - So you guys are completely right about the winner equipment and the microscope, 
        - So that's the main idea. That's the main equipment that we use but everybody has excellent ideas and now I know that everybody read this text and everybody has knowledge about this. So I am very impressed with your, with your answers.
        - Ok. 
        - You're doing a great job you're doing a fantastic job so far. Okay. 
        - Yeah, I'm feeling good. I know a lot about this stuff.
        - i'm sorry teacher, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Yeah. Um, so when I was looking at, like, when I was looking at the beginning I was thinking like what equipment, the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as, like, I know what I use microscopes in class. So I know that you have to use them, and it says microscopic in the reading, it says that things are really small, so you'd have to use a microscope.
        - I think equipment 
        - Okay and Oliver, you said that I, you said I circled the same as Farrah.
        -  So you all did an awesome job of looking back in the story. 
        - um yeah well I I changed my answer to.
        - Good and Farrah?
        - Okay. Um, so, so you had selected a machine a small machine. Right. But let's let's before we go into that, 
        - I know a lot about space.
        - With job. Yes. Right, so you all now know here, Chris...
        - um i'm really sorry but um it's time for us to go now.
        - and see me a little bit is still in display skin my.
        - I love the participation so far from everybody. You guys are doing great.
        - Yes, it is excellent.
        - Okay um I learned that if it says evidence, you have to say something in the story.
        - But still really great thing to think about because not everybody thought about that intheir response. But you did. So that was good.
        - Yes. Very, very cool. 
        - Yes, that's very good. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Really?
        - Good awesome, amazing.
        - Oh, Farrah. That's a really good question. And you guys gave us some really good answer. 
        - That they use a scientific tool called a microscope.
        - yeah they definitely use a lot of equipment, though
        - Yes, and Jazmin.
        - Well, that's awesome. So, I'm sure, that'd be something you'd be really interested in learning about.
        - And you said that they use the microscope so Farrah, I'd like to turn to you and Luis You keep on looking for that information. I'll turn to Farrah Farrah. 
        - Okay you. Thank you. You're good to go.
        - It was it no, it was used to investigate.
        - that's good.
        - It was the only equipment in paragraph two.
        - We will get to that in just a moment. Give me a moment to identify some of these words because, I don't know about you guys, but some of these are kind of difficult to understand at face value. 
        - yeah great job Luis 
        - Um, well.
        - yeah yeah okay.
        - Thanks for adding Luis yeah I don't I think they have to use a bunch of different tools to look and so thank you for contributing your opinion Chris, do you have a question.
        - Um, well, my, my full answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Um, but I think I'm going to talk about Chris's response really quickly so Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah. Um, but I didn't. I didn't know anything about the water
        - yeah that's pretty important 
        - That's true, but, that is true. So with the microscope--
        - Okay cool 
        - yeah I agree it seems like all of the all of the words in the question are really important 
        - yeah so she went first I figure I don't have to say, the exact same thing as her because I found that same answer.
        - Okay see nods from everybody. That's great.
        -  I would love moon flowers.
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, so
        - Uh-huh.
        - One moment. 
        - You don't? Well, I'm, again, this is a more of a discussion based exercise. So maybe you have something you can contribute to this group.
        - And Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine.
        - Microscope. Right. And that was one of the tools that they are using what
        - yep.
        - Yeah, to look really closely.
        - But, but I actually, I was talking about, like, my answer to the question because cuz I I wrote that. Let me see, what did I circle okay I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Like, I don't get why is that a wrong answer.
        - That would be really cool. 
        - Um, well, I guess, I guess I'm not sure because like you have, you have like the microscope, but you would study it and then you have like Jazmin, said the Lunar Orbiter.
        - But thank you, Jazmin for that now. Chris. The for part three. That last sentence there.
        - And I think that three of you Chris Jazmin and even I think you all had said yes it's valuable and you gave one of their reasons, and I think that was great.
        - Awesome, thank you for sharing. 
        - Right. That's a really good observation. I love that. 
        - Teacher : Okay Luis reread and then I'd like to see if you can get a different answer. Okay.
        - Exactly, exactly.
        - awesome you're right.
        - Good so in this question whatever you're looking for Jazmin i'll get back to you in a minute one second okay.
        - I pretty much use the same thing. Like, I looked at the third paragraph and that was where I found like what I was mostly looking
        - You're right, they do use tons of different equipment. 
        - Alright, welcome back. So, oh, actually, I believe one of the students had something to say, Hang on one second.
        - Yeah yeah. It was like, Okay. So the scientists found found water in the crater. So like, that was my answer.
        - um yeah I mean, so my answer was kind of like what Chris just pass I said, scientists, he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - I said discover.
        - i'm like something something you use to do something.
        - Luis said we could break it down to oxygen, hydrogen, we could breathe it. We could use it for rocket fuel. 
        - Yeah, I circled that same thing. 
        - Oh okay um so maybe, could you hold off for one sec Luis 
        - Is he really we'll have to talk to him after school about all this stuff that you're learning about
        - A tool
        - Okay, so that could be one thing that's useful 
        - So you and Jazmin both had very good answers.
        - Right very good 
        - I'm trying my supporting but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go. But I did want to say that I appreciate it. How you kept asking about
        - Exactly, Chris. Awesome job.
        - Oh cool 
        - So Chris back to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon correct yeah?
        - Okay. All right. So, Chris, what's up man, how are you
        - Wow, thank you for sharing.
        - Okay, good.
        - Yeah, so I think that's really good information. And I appreciate you sharing with us. I want to bring us back to the question, though.
        - Oliver, you put the same thing I Farrah. Correct.
        - No. No. It was in paragraph 3. Paragraph 3.
        - So let's go back. Luis, put your hand up for just a minute we'll get to you in just a moment. Your next up.
        - Oh, that is a great question. I think that is something we could both look at for the next time we have class. How did they find the water under the moon. It's craters.
        - And Farrah, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Great thanks. Jazmin, what about you.
        -  so Jazmin I know your answer was that they had small mush oh yes Luis.
        - Well, I want to say teacher, thank you for when you, you asked us all so many questions to try and.
        - Very good. So
        - Thank you for sharing, though, and thanks for being a team player.
        - They said that scientists need a microscope to find water in the craters on the moon.
        - Very good. Very good. 
        - Yeah, so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no, the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so I said that, yes, the evidence is convincing, and that's because astronauts wanna
        - Water great okay that's a great idea Jazmin.
        - Great another great keyword 
        - yeah that's exactly right that's what i'm thinking to face is pretty incredible so we'll have to wait and find out what these scientists come up with.
        - Well, what I read was in paragraph two and it said in the first paragraph that NASA sent a small machine.
        - so Farrah you mentioned that there's a microscope
        - You said that astronauts can drink the water.
        - See, we have to use a microscope to be able to see those
        - Jazmin let's give Chris one more second okay so Chris double check that. 
        - So Chris. Your response was, scientists found crators for water on the moon.That's good observation.
- intent: r110.2
  examples: |
        - yeah, right, they do use a lot of equipment. I think my suggestion for you here, because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment.
        - Are exactly right. So, uh, equipment is a tool. You guys are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and
        - Maybe your answer is right. So your answer that that NASA send a small machine. And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there.
        - So your, your answer is not wrong. I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us, microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it. So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon. Does that help you understand more?
        - Your answer is not wrong. So this is a two part question.
        - Your answer is not wrong. That's not, that's not why you're in this group. I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine.
        - Actually, yeah, I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that
        - They did find craters full of water. 
        - But then why is my answer wrong?
        - I mean, technically, those would all be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water. let's think.
        - No, I was just wondering like what, if you remember the name, because that is correct, that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon.
        - Oh, I didn't say that. No. No. No, your answer isn't wrong. We're just wanting to find kind of even more. OK? About it. So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?
        - Um, well, I said, pretty much the same thing as Farrah, um, you know, like I thought it was the microscope.
        - Again that's the correct answer, and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that.
        - Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment. so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer. it says what kind of equipment that they use. So if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer.
        - The different thing that they, that they need, so they need.
        - mm hmm, no, you're not, Oliver, you're not, I want, I want you to understand that you're not wrong.
        - Yeah, absolutely. 
        - Okay, well, I added like a longer answer than Jazmin's one and I, and I said, the name of the equipment in mind, so So why is mine wrong?
        - Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct. 
        - yeah, it was a good answer.
        - Yeah, you are correct. Jazmin. 
        - yeah, no, that's a very well Olivereloped answer. 
        - Right. And that is correct. 
        - So, yeah, just kind of thinking about, more like that, but you did great. you know it was, it was a good answer. you did awesome. 
        - And Jazmin, once look at yours and NASA send a small machine, which you are correct about that as well.
        - yeah, absolutely, good job.
        - What I say, yes, it's valuable, cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships.
        - Right, right. Do you remember, okay, I love that you're talking about the water. because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right? 
        - Sounds good.
        - Okay, so you're actually on the right track. Um, I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong.
        - That is equipment, you're correct. They have to use all those things before they can start their explorations. That is right Chris.
        - That was a wonderful answer. Does anyone else want to add their answer to it?
        - When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct
        - Oh, okay, okay.
        - Right, good. That's what I was trying to get out of, you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right?
        - Um, yes. microscope is a kind of a scientist tool.
        - Oh, right. So, it is a small machine. that is correct.
        - Your answer is not wrong. So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely. Okay. You're right about that.
        - Exactly, exactly. We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water. 
        - You use those.
        - That's really, really cool. So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon. You guys all had responses that were definitely
        - Awesome. Well, I love this response that you have right now. That was amazing. 
        - Okay, thank you. So that's a great thing to circle. 
        - and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying.
        - yeah
        - Like you said to Jazmin, the name of the equipment, The name of the equipment that they used. Oh, yeah. I didn't write the name of the equipment.
        - Well, your answers aren't wrong, 
        - That's a very great response and great observation, based on the text.
        - It's not wrong. You're still correct they you will need a microscope. If you want to see the water. 
        - No. Your answer isn't wrong. 
        - Um, well, I mean, I just, I, I feel like I i put words down from from story and
        - All right. Awesome. I really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on Earth. That was really wonderful. 
        - I don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way I was thinking about so here, so I actually just bought my own kids.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this.
        - Yeah. Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong. 
        - It's not wrong. 
        - Orbiter. Good job. Okay. So you said. They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here. 
        -  But that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well. So thank you for adding that
        - That a small machine did collect the water on the moon.
        - Yeah, yeah. I thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong.
        - Um, that's really interesting. Farrah, because you're right to look at something really closely, you would need a microscope. But let's think.
        - And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct, 
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water, 
        - Okay, and Jazmin. Your answer is not wrong. 
        - So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which        - that's a great piece of knowledge. That's something we always want to keep with us.
        - So yeah, I think it was a small machine. The lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon. And then I guess it lands on the moon, and then it would discover the water, I think
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon, and there was some water in there,
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right. 
        - No, ma'am. You can keep your answer the same.
        - well.
        - Perfect. Excellent. Okay, Chris.
        - I don't necessarily think any one answer was.
        - Everybody's answer was correct.
        - Yeah, that's a great point. Chris. So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon. So yeah, you would need that equipment.
        - A microscope was used. There was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment
        - Jazmin no one ever said, your answer was wrong and your answer, I would say right now, your answer is not wrong.
        - yeah they That is exactly what the story said, and that was a really good observation 
        - Very good. That's a very good answer. 
        - No. Craters aren't equipment. So I guess no.
        - That's very true. That's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon. 
        - um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water. That is perfectly correct Jazmin and I don't think your answers wrong I just think.
        - Your answer isn't really wrong. It's not wrong, Jazmin.
        - yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um.
        - I don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all. It was a small machine.
        - You guys were all mostly right in your responses. Yes, Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah.
        - And that's right, Farrah did choose a correct objects,
        - Right. And I'm not saying your, your answer is wrong. 
        - And I think Chris did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that. Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for.
        - So I think your answers        - none of your answers are wrong. I think sometimes they can use improvement. But Farrah, I do want to point out that your response. 
        - Awesome Jazmin Thank you so much so, you said that NASA sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for
        - Um,
        - Okay, I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong, I actually I don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong, I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space.
        - Okay, so that could be a one use of water. Luis?
        - Yes, yep you are.
        - I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text. 
        - Yeah, I actually, I do because I know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something. And so I'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story. So like if there weren't even astronauts, they wouldn't really need a microscope.
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can.
        - They have the oxygen tanks, because they need to be able to breathe.
        - It's not that your answers are wrong. 
        - Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to.
        - A small machine that is correct.
        - Great, so that's that's a good answer
        - Oh yeah. Okay. So, in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So you have to see it. You can't see it without microscope.
        - Chris, when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, I think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right.
        - So your answer is correct, and you did a great job with your thinking. 
        - Expeditions they need oxygen like Chris said they need the proper space equipment. If they're leaving our earth.
        - Now, these are all true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right.
        - Oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong, 
        - Yes, that is correct.
        - Okay, I'll work on that.
        - Mm hmm. You're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool. And that's what the question was asking was asking which tools, specifically did they use to find this water, and I believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right everybody read the reading?
        - What we never said you guys answers were wrong. 
        - Yeah. Scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank.
        - Mm hmm. Um, let's see, I so your answer wasn't wrong.
        - yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water.
        - That's right. You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need. So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why.
        - And we all gave really good answers.
        - Okay Luis's answer was about how they got to the moon, okay so astronaut have to have things to fly around and have oxygen in order to get to the moon. That is correct. 
        - And Jazmin, you rightly said that it's a machine.
        - Very good. So like Luis said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon.
        - Right. So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space. You are correct.
        - But the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding
        - I think so, like, do I need to. I need them. They need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way.
        - It is. It is, I didn't say it was wrong.
        - It's not wrong at all. 
        - Your, your answer is not wrong.
        - Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool. Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as
        - yeah um but other than that I, I thank you guys, like all the guys, I think I understood the passages like Well, yes, that.
        - I said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water.
        - Oh, okay, great.
        - Your answer is. So you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it. Right, Farrah?
        - Well, your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct NASA did send a small machine
        - Yes, the scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That is the result. Right.
        - Yeah. So, you are correct. 
        - Perfect. And, you know, that was a very good answer. Thank you for sharing.
        - It would and it would be really useful too. Luis What about you.
        - Chris your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct
        -  You're right. You're so right. If there are astronauts on the moon. There needs to be oxygen tags.
        - Jazmin your answer is not necessarily wrong.
        - With what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon.
        - Farrah I want to go back to your answer. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And that is very, very true, 
        - You're not wrong and I didn't even think of it that way. So I'm glad you brought this point up
        - We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but
        - The question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon. And that's why I said I'm the small machine I that's why I picked the one from paragraph to because
        - Scientists are a part of it. 
        - So that's actually, I'm glad you said that because that's part of the process. We didn't necessarily talk about in this text. Or in this section of the text.
        - You did, um. 
        - It's not wrong, 
        - You're right on what you said.
        - Um, I'm not sure. Um, I have to read it through again. Okay.
        - The only person Jazmin is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable.
        -  So in essence kind of both of them are correct. 
        - All right, no one's wrong. I want to make that very clear. No one's wrong. We're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right.
        - You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - mm hmm yeah so you are completely correct NASA did send a small machine and that was used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yes. Thank you. That's great. I'm so glad that you could clarify.
        - You got a lot closer there. I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there. So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        - Right. So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon, 
        - Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon.
        - that's a great answer um.
        - Um, so your answer to your answer is correct, right.
        - I like that. That's a really good way of thinking about it. What does anyone else-
        - Good. Good job. All right. Luis You have a question?
        - So, Farrah, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect. Your answer's your answer is correct.
        - Alright awesome Farrah I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon.
        - With your answer is not completely wrong. It's more than it's just missing a little bit of information.
        - Well, I'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does.
        - um well I I said it wasn't ready yet so I said no too.  
        - In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it.
        - Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake. Those are great job, guys. Thank you.
        - Okay. So you're absolutely right. And it's not your answer isn't wrong,
        - And I see it's the microscope. Very good, very good. Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        - Now, they discovered the water. You got that right on the nose.
        - So, so how come I'm in this group.
        - Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something. 
        - No, I'm not saying your answers wrong. 
        - Well, I don't know because I thought it was the microscope, because how can you find something if it's too small to see.
        - that's really great point 
        - that's that's exactly right Farrah The one thing that that you said that I want to clarify, as you mentioned.
        - Yeah, that's really cool.
        - That is true. You could if there's enough water.
        - Right. So that answers the question. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. That's great. Nice work!
        - Yeah, exactly. So they had to use the microscope to find it. 
        - You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything. I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct. 
        - Um, yeah, I guess this is kind of a question. Um, so here's the thing. Like, I know all about space, like, I don't think I should be in this group, because I don't really get answers about space like wrong.
        - That's a very good point. You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - Perfect. Luis you have a very, very good response with a lot of detail in it 
        - just like Luis brought up about space. He's looking into it. He knows this is not just about equipment but about space. Yes, Farrah.
        - So I love how you found that a microscope was used to find water, 
        - I guess not, I guess they must have used all of them like different, like the microscop and the lunar orbiter.
        - So let's see your answer was NASA sent a small machine. That answer is not incorrect at all, and I think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case I just think
        - Oh okay i'm happy to help you out there, so you are right in that you are definitely have to really get really small to figure out that this water because, like we were saying earlier there's not a whole lot of water on the moon.
        - So you both have very different responses, but they're both correct, so they didn't use a microscope and that was your answer so that would make yours correct.
        - You put it doesn't. I don't know. I don't know how
        - Oliver you did an amazing job with that sentence starter.
        - Okay, now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules. Right?
        - No. Your answer was correct it, you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very, very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes
        - There you go. They could. 
        - There's nothing wrong with any of your responses at all.
        - Absolutely. Great job. 
        - Oh okay teacher, I just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you for kind of.
        - Um, well okay so I I'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong, because I think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what I mean? Tey had to look at the water to see it.
        - RER: We actually have to go to lunch. 
        - I would say that a lot better answers the question. And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect. We might include how those
        - um yeah i'm so sorry um I just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how.
        - I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means. Okay.
        - Yes, you, you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon. Again, true. 
        - Jazmin your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that NASA a small machine
        - Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water. So yes, that's something really good to add Chris. Thank you. Oliver?
        -  So Farrah you are. You are correct with the microscope.
        - Cool. And that's, that's like different from
        - And so it's not that your answer is incorrect, 
        - In fact, it is the microscope and part of the answers is right, it is the microscope.
        - it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine
        - Remembering that any answer can be made better but it's not that you have a wrong answer that maybe it's just answering a different question right so let's try and strengthen our answers here,
        - Yes, Jazmin. So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong. Your answer was never wrong Jazmin's original answer was that scientist.
        - I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct
        - but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that 
        - Your answer at the top is correct, you did find the equipment. 
        -  so they were both right both of your both of your answers.
        - you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great.
        - Yeah. Your answer was right that the scientists did find craters full water on the moon. You're right.
        - Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space. There's not a lot of oxygen. So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe. So that was one equipment that they did use
        - Correct 
        - You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong. 
        - So it is right.
        - Oh so Jazmin I let's clarify. I don't think any of your answers are wrong. I think all of you answer the questions.
        - You yeah to look at really small thing.
        - savannas right.
        - They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?
        - yeah so I see yeah that's perfect evidence in the text to support your statement that water can be valuable.
        - So I think that you're right. Chris NASA does use a lot of different tools when it's exploring space.
        - So I don't think your answers wrong, I think you have a really, really great start to a strong response so in the text, it does actually say NASA sent a small machine.
        - Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for. They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like. 
        - Both of you are correct. On what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon.
        - I guess my question is, like, so if Farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong, just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like I'm confused. Like if my answers wrong
        - With your response you had mentioned that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that seems really helpful you can't survive without water that's definitely true right.
        - Exactly. 
        - It is.
        - Yeah, so I would say based on our text here, they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon.
        - Oh okay yeah so you're right you're so right about the craters there's definitely some craters.
        - Okay, um, but, but, but, but, okay. So, but I read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three
        - Um, yeah. So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us.
        - Your answer is not wrong. Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon. So, you are right.
        - Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading. It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so Chris talk
        - To see it.
        - Well, Jazmin, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart.
        - Um, well Jazmin just said the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right. So I'm figuring that's the right answer.
        - So I think that's a great start yeah awesome
        - Cute. Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong. 
        - That's right. So you weren't wrong at all.
        - And that is true. Chris, the scientists did find craters with ice in them. 
        - yeah well, I thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really, really small it's actually like a really, really, really small pieces.
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to take a moment and I wanted to thank you for working with us today.
        - Um, yeah. So I think for me like I was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use. And I was thinking about, like, you know that they have other equipment that they use. That's not necessarily in the reading but but I know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah
        - Oh.
        - Hmm. Good. Remembering yes it does say that. So that's a great piece of information that we can actually all use To help answer the question, even better, 
        - Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question. 
        - Um, yeah, like water can be split into two parts. It can be, you know, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water
        - Well, good. I liked your answers. Scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So they did using what they, 
        - Alright, so I know this is a little smaller and I wanted to explain to you guys that before you get worried, I want you guys, to know that your responses were all great.
        - And Luis that's totally right the scientists do use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon.
        - Right, so they. Those are different types of equipment that scientists use. So you guys are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water.
        - Okay, so you're saying I'm
        - It's definitely your that's correct, that it was a small machine that they sent To find the ice deposits or just trying to look A little bit deeper into What the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than Farrah and I thought.
        - Since we're all in this small group.
        - So you said NASA centers small machine.
        - um it's.
        - Uh huh. Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you guys read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right. That's a good connection Chris. Good job.
        - Did everybody see that's the whole question okay so Luis if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100% right because you circled information in your brain.
        - Oh well, I mean, I guess, I thought they did on.
        - Okay, it's not necessarily wrong at all. That's a great answer, because you're right. They did NASA did send a small machine. 
        - So your answer is not wrong Jazmin.
        - Um, I think I began to see, but I'm still kind of confused because so if they use the Lunar Orbiter to to find it, they couldn't see it without the microscope, like they had to go out and look at the crystals, right?
        - There was nothing wrong with your answer. I like there. I like both of your answers. I just wanted everybody to be on the same page.
        -  So Jazmin your answer That they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer. And it is mentioned here in the text.
        - yeah yeah.
        - With your answer is not wrong.
        - Correct they did have to use the equipment so Luis and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters.
        - You can stay hydrated.
        - You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question. Right?
        - There's        - so as long as you're using evidence to support your answer, there is really there isn't technically a wrong answer.
        - And I can, I can tell you where I found it, I found it in part to the beginning of Part two
        - And no one's answer is wrong.
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right here and thank you for making that connection and sharing those ideas with us.
        - yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - I don't. Your answer isn't wrong.
        - microscope Okay, so I do lot love the Oliveron and Farrah you guys are making the connections with microscope because Yes, you are correct because, in order to look at it closely, you need it, you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead Oliveron.
        - I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words.
        - Oh well, okay. So in part one, they talk about
        - Oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the Lunar orbiter and the microscope.
        - That is a tool that astronauts use on the moon you're right.
        - Thank you. Jazmin and absolutely none of you were wrong. You were all correct to an extent, thank you for being here. Go on to lunch.
        - Yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool, a scientific tool. So that's equipment.
        - um the scientists found for creators, full of water on the moon on 
        - I will say, Jazmin. And your answer is right.
        -  but as long as we gathered all of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct, whether or not you think it is or not.
        - This isn't necessarily every single person who ever had to sit down with the teacher again sometime's your answers not wrong. Absolutely completely right.
        - So you can think of a way that they use oxygen tanks to find water, they might need oxygen tanks to be on the moon.
        - That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine. So your answer was right. 
        - Let's figure answers Farrah, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely
        - Use to like breathe or walk or you know, to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool.
        - backed up why you said, because if you had just said that you put creator down I probably would have marked it as a wrong answer, but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water, it is a very good.
        - Right. OK, now that is correct. 
        - But nothing's wrong with your paragraph. 
        - yeah I yeah that's very true and the microscope is another piece of equipment that the scientists use.
        - Very cool. I didn't know that there was water on the moon before I read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well. 
        - So I mean he's not wrong, 
        - So thank you for sharing Thank you 
        - It says your        - the microscope is right it is very much right, 
        - So even they are not the exact answer, they help us to view the main answer. Okay, so there is no wrong answer on here.
        - Yeah, I can say was just wondering, since I was thinking like that. It seemed like the Lunar Orbiter, we see that they use to discover the water. So is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one?
        - hmm Farrah I love your thinking because you're totally right that the article  talk about using a microscope to look at the water.
        - I would like to see if Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. And they did
        - That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts Chris.
        - Yes, they do.
        - Okay, I am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong. Your everybody's answer is
        - Yes. So I was kind of thinking like, um, I was thinking that well, I went to NASA and I know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters.
        - I thought that was a great idea to be you. Look at that. I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy. 
        - You. Yeah, I didn't actually so I didn't really see anything in here but I kind of, I did have a question that came up from reading and it was like
        - We're getting a little bit off topic here, but Luis you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that. 
        - You're all right.
        - And that is absolutely correct. And I appreciate you sharing that with us. And in fact, our article today discusses the importance of oxygen. 
        - Well, I guess I didn't really like do the reading exactly. I kind of just like had my knowledge. But, um, so I guess no.
        - Oh no I just circled small machine.
        - And that is a great answer. 
        - Okay. Um, we definitely need oxygen. When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here.
        - Right and we know that a machine is the type of equipment okay.
        - Exactly, exactly. So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text.
        - I don't have to change mine either?
        - I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong. Right. 
        - When I read your answer that like I want, I want to reinforce and I want you to know that your answer is correct you're you're you're not sitting at the table, because your answer is wrong, none of you are.
        - Your answer is not wrong scientists used lots of different machines to discover the water on the moon
        - I didn't say your answer was wrong.
        - A small machine, right, perfect. What is that small machine called
        - You need a microscope to be able
        - Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely.
        - Your answer is correct
        - I like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever I asked you about the garden. What makes you think you could, and you're telling me.
        - I like the connection you made there. All right.
        - Oh, I don't think that that's wrong, I think that you bring up a really good point because you found information in a different paragraph.
        - I don't think your answer is wrong, we did read that you do need a Microscope to look closely at the moon, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air. Right. And if you don't have the heavy water.
        - So no one's answer is wrong. It's just that some answers are
        - you're not in this group, because your answers are necessarily wrong right 
        - So like I said earlier, none of your answers are wrong. 
        - Great. And there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had
        - So Farrah was both they're both correct because it used to discover the water it doesn't have to do with.
        - So you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true
        - A small machine. That's right.
        - Yeah, you're exactly right here. So thank you for that added comment.
        - Exactly. And I did. And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out. Awesome job.
        - You're right, but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water. Maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without Jazmin, you have something to add.
        - Full of water on the moon good observation. Yes, I remember that from the text as well. Good job. 
        - You know Jazmin when I read your answer, I actually thought that your answer completed the question correctly.
        - Well, okay. Well, it kind of goes along with my
        - I'm just going to go one by one. So, Farrah. I just want to start with you. I really did enjoy your answer. You really picked up from the text and
        - i'm so Luis for your sentence, I have seen anything terrible wrong with it, but.
        - wow you're you're a super right and that was perfect timing, because your classmate Luis his his sentence was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank so two great minds think alike, am I right.
        - Yeah, definitely. I think I know what you mean.
        - Okay, you know what, Chris I. That sounds like a good point. So maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water, 
        - I didn't say it was wrong.
        - A garden. Okay. Yes.
        - Oh, that would be awesome. That is very good thinking 
        - Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that. 
        - You your applied to it was scientists found creators, full of water on the moon, so your sentence isn't wrong and you bring up a good point that.
        - So Farrah. I would say that your answer wasn't wrong at all. 
        - Well, it's not wrong. 
        - So Farrah after I read your answer. And your answer is wonderful. You answered part of the question you found the equipment that they used right that
        - awesome great love that detail that you're using 
        - Great job remembering that they found the water on the moon. 
        - And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes. 
        - Perfect. That is a very good answer. Farrah. 
        - Right, those are good, those are good points, both both of you guys 
        - So the lunar orbiter the microscope and you said some masks and other oxygen tanks and equipment like that. So that's really good.
        - This pretty good, but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does
        - So I think you guys
        - Instruments, they used to find the water, which was microscope. So that's really great.
        - but technically, your answer was right they did find-oh i'm sorry they
        - Yes, I agree with you. 
        - All right, Chris. How are we doing so your response was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is completely true. 
        - Well, that, that's correct. They have to have certain equipment to get to the moon. 
        - And you know what's been I was wrong i'm sorry about that I just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the microscope was part of the equipment, so you are also right, so thank you for that as well.
        - That is really, really cool information, and I know the text references oxygen tanks, too, so that is really awesome for you to bring up Thank you Chris 
        - but you guys were right there at it so so
        - They're not necessarily wrong. 
        - It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean. Good job.
        - So right now, your answer seems pretty solid.
        - Hmm, I suppose it's in a large polar crater, right? Okay now your answer is correct, they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit. 
        -  i'm so sorry.
        - Yeah, they definitely use those. 
        - yeah so Oliver you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and Jazmin's answer about the Lunar orbiter was correct.
        - You're right. Yes, scientists that work with NASA need a lot of equipment to be able to be able to safely do their
        - It's not wrong.
        - Okay well we're going to get to that in one second. All right, Farrah, and it's not wrong. We're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it. Okay. All right. Luis Can you share what you underlined in paragraph two,
        - That's good. That's correct, yes. Jazmin.
        - I can read the question 
        - So Chris. You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - I don't necessarily        - you're not all necessarily here because your answers were wrong or bad. 
        - Your answer is totally correct everybody has correct answers in this group
        - So you were extremely, extremely close.
        - I'm with a different type of answer, but I don't think any of your questions were wrong. 
        - Yes, you're right. Your answer is not wrong at all.
        - Jazmin and Chris you both came up with great answers for why water.
        - Your answer wasn't wrong they did use this question, 
        - Thank you. Yeah, I don't understand why my answers wrong. 
        - Mm hmm. And that's a very good way to do it. That's cool. Mm hmm.
        - Yeah. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff.
        - Yeah, yeah. And you're right. 
        - Treats partial understandings as valid interpretations of text (e.g., "You're correct        - your answer is correct")
        - And it does say that, um, does it. So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?
        - That's correct. They wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon.
        - Okay, they use several types of of of equipment. Okay, thank you.
        - And they do mention in the reading and then the story about.
        - Well, I guess if I look at it, like, it says like the lunar orbiter, right, that they sent up in space
        - And then we've got what Farrah said, which was the microscope so these might be different pieces of equipment or tools that scientists are using to find water on the moon.
        - Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and Farrah good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours. So you're both right. You just didn't have the--
        - Oh, well, what makes you think your answers wrong.
        - Yes, can you tell me like what executive answer.
        - When I looked over your answer. There was some great points you brought about it. It wasn't that it wasn't wrong. It is what it is. 
        - But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon. So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon.
        - So yeah, that's kind of how you could have done it. But yeah, this was a good start. Yeah, good foundation. 
        - microscope yep that's right 
        - I didn't say it was wrong. Your answer isn't wrong.
        - your answers not wrong it's just there's multiple parts to it,
        - Thinking about discovery so you're right that they were using the microscope to look at the water they found 
        - You are correct in that they found is using a small machine 
        - And it's true that this NASA scientists will use a lot of tools to 
        - You're exactly right. And it also says in the second paragraph, um, that they do, they could not breathe oxygen. So they do use those suits and they do use oxygen tanks when they're up on the moon and when they're in space.
        - Just outright wrong, 
        - Your answer wasn't wrong. It had all the great all the good pieces in it, 
        - Yeah, cuz I said that, yes, that there's convincing evidence and I said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water.
        - Yes. So if there was water, you could make a garden you could grow it using the water. 
        - You weren't wrong after all.
        - That is a very good question so Jazmin's answer was correct, but your answer is also correct because this question has multiple answers to it.
        - but you guys all gave answers that were very valid.
        - There's nothing wrong with your answer. 
        - Oh okay so um you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon well, so your answer was true it wasn't wrong
        - Yes, it was the microscope. Does everybody see where Farrah found that in paragraph three?
        - Very good. So, Farrah. Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further.
        - Yeah, I love that you mentioned the microscope, because that was definitely necessary.
        - Actually, I think I agree with savannas answer.
        - Your answer is not wrong, Jazmin. 
        - You really picked the object, which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that I really appreciate it.
        - Honestly, like you, all of you are right, 
        - Oh Okay, so if I just put NASA sent a small machine then i'm right.
        - But the Lunar Orbiter. One second, Luis. The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used, so that the both of those answers, would be correct. It's not one is right and one is wrong.
        - I didn't really read it so I can read it, I guess.
        - yeah, so we need them both 
        - They did and so those craters.
        - Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question.
        - equipment that you find whether it's in the text, or you think of it in your head.
        - Is not wrong Farrah. 
        - So yeah, so well. Okay, so when I was reading. I saw that
        - you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right.
        - Farrah. OK, so maybe Farrah your answer is correct.
        - Great response.
        - It is
        - I think that what you said, made perfect sense that the Lunar orbiter is what equipment with us to discover water on the moon, 
        - Because, well your answer is not wrong. You're definitely. Well, you guys are all definitely right with your answers that you guys that they did use a microscope. They did send a small machine.
        - These are all pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations. That's a great point. Chris 
        - Teacher : Okay, so you said NASA and the small machine which is absolutely right. 
        - Perfect Yes, you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the Lunar orbiter might do that as well, so we're going to take some different places, and I think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah, Oliver what do you think.
        - Oh OK, so we could say either one.
        - The small machine are both equipment they are tools. 
        - I'm not saying I'm not saying it's wrong. They didn't use machinery. I think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong. You were
        - Your answer is very right they did use a microscope. 
        - Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong 
        - But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money. So it might not be worked at. Oliver.
        - Okay. Yes, good response.
        - So, am I like more right because I was saying about the Orbiter and like Farrah is like sort of right? But you know, I'm like wondering.
        - And Jazmin. I just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong.
        - RER: The lunar orbiter?
        - Thank you both for adding those strong answers from the text. 
        - That is correct. 
        - um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon, they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes.
        - so you said you are 100% correct and it said NASA send a small machine.
        - Yeah, I, I also know that because I know a lot about space. So I know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah I know that
        - But you had a really good answer, Jazmin. All of you had really good answers.
        - Thank you for sharing and today is so important because No one's answer is wrong.
        - Well, it's not wrong.
        - And you're right to say that the scientists need a tool, called the microscope to look really closely 
        - Yeah, so I think a lot is a good guessing. 
        - yeah you're right if scientists on the moon don't have oxygen tanks that's not any good ISM.
        - So that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses. Yes. Chris.
        - I understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon, but
        - So Chris also that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is absolutely correct. They did.
        - But I know that we're here in the group to sort of help with our answers. But I am not really sure why my answer is wrong. It seems it is the microscope
        - Hmm. Absolutely. They do. Those are all part of the process of going up to the moon and using the Lunar Orbiter to find the end the microphone and a microscope To find the small amounts of water in the crater. 
        - Right, you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer. 
        - So you're both right. So, which is a good thing. That's great about working in groups. We all participate and contribute
        - cool yeah because in this question we're really trying to address how they discovered the water on the moon.  right so that's where we're focusing on those tools in particular.
        - Well, that was right too 
        - So you're right in that they did use they did use a microscope.
        - Because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and I'm
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct. 
        - A small machine. Well, I don't think that you're wrong. 
        - Great. And that's a good connection. So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate Jazmin, you said it again?
        - All right. Chris, first off, I really loved your response because you showed that you really, like, you read the reading, and you kind of took that in, 
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And you weren't wrong. That was a machine that a piece of equipment that NASA uses that the astronaut uses. 
        - Answer is not wrong. 
        - So your answers not wrong 
        - They both have the right answer they're both.
        - You can look your answers are there you are correct  they had water
        - um yeah so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much, I feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on, and that was really helpful, thank you.
        - Oh, oh, okay. So, just add some more to my answer.
        - And that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, that makes sense.
        - Um, what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon.
        - But OK so Farrah let's think about I like that you said microscope that was part of the equipment they use.
        - Um, yeah. So imperative to, well, I underline the same thing like small machine.
        - Good job, Jazmin. Did everybody hear that while Luis was reading
        - That's actually a good answer, because it talks about the water they found on the, on the, on the moon was microscopic 
        - I don't remember. The other thing it was the thing that you said Jazmin it's it's it if you if you can get water up there, then you don't have to take it with you, I guess.
        - it's a very good thought.
        - yeah that's awesome I see it, right in the second paragraph NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer.
        - That was Farrah's answer, mine was about the small machine. I thought that that was be the right answer.
        - You're right. You did a great job with with understanding what water is even. How can it be valuable for us on the moon.
        - they're both right, you need both things.
        - And that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon.
        - yeah, so I think, based on what everyone has shared we realize the scientists need lots of different tools to do their work right.
        - so severe that your answer isn't exactly wrong sometimes we just need help explaining. 
        - No, you weren't wrong I just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the, you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely 
        - Okay, so I'm reading it now. And the other thing I guess is that I don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the Lunar Orbiter. So how can that be the right one, because they don't have discover in this one. Oh, I do see look for ice.
        - And that is, that is a very true point um and I think this answer was a really good answer I just know.
        - Yeah a lot. I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks. That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before. Did you know the name of this orbiter?
- intent: r110.3
  examples: |
        - Well, i'm excited for you to share all your knowledge with your other classmates.
        - Yes, that is so true and Luis you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right.
        - Very good. I like how you connected your experience of going to NASA to help you understand and reading the text better. 
        - That's a great experience you had a bet that was really cool.
        - And they would need those on the moon. And I know you said you know a lot about space. So that is a very good response.
        - Me and my dad went
        - Yeah, great. I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge. 
        - But one of the reasons that I wanted to to have you here, besides the fact that you're our in house space expert.
        - but I am so glad that you are passionate about this subject. that's going to help us.
        - Great, it look like you're an expert in our group. 
        - So maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge. Okay.
        - And so, we, I know, Luis you know a lot about this. 
        - OK. OK. OK, well, it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say, Mr. Dallas, thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on. So now I know that I should explain my ideas or say them in my own words, even if they're the same as what somebody else said. And then I also heard you tell Jazmin what she should work on, too. So thank you very much.
        - I do 
        - Right. So that's really cool that you've been to NASA and you have all this background knowledge. 
        - Well, Luis, if that's the case, um, you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space. is that all right?
        - awesome. I love that you spend time to learn about science outside of class. that's really impressive.
        - But I think that's really cool and and i love that you all have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so
        - um, i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um Luis 
        - You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses.
        - Okay, yeah, I can do that.
        - Okay, so we're going to work on that. But it's really great that you know a lot about space. that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions.
        - that's good that you actually went to NASA. you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool.
        - I can tell you anything you want to know.
        - Awesome, so Luis used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment, so that's awesome. Luis
        - yeah, that's great again. I love the background info. 
        - me, yeah, no, you're so right. that sounds like a really cool trip to NASA and you're right that scientists at NASA use a lot of different equipment.
        - Or maybe you could help us out.
        - and also, you can help share share some stuff with other people in the class.
        - Do you really?
        - awesome, yeah. that sounds great. i'm super into that.
        - Oh yeah. I can definitely help out.
        - that's right. Yeah, so just like Luis was saying, there's a lot of equipment when you're out in space.
        - What.
        - Okay, that sounds okay. okay.
        - Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, 
        - Do you know what? since you know so much about space, when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know. 
        - Wow, to know all about space, you must know a lot.
        - So Chris, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses. 
        - You don't think you should be in this group. Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered. So I'm glad you're here with us. 
        - Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space. 
        - Yeah, I, I'm kind of space expert on which is why I picked oxygen tanks. That's my answer.
        - I said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit.
        - yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it Chris, so that's        - Now, if the question had asked about your personal experience, then you could mention what you had seen at NASA, that would be very interesting for sure, ok?
        - To help us with some information that might not even be in the text. So you might be able to help us add some additional info but
        - Wow, that seems really awesome.
        - That's really awesome. Luis I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon.
        -  so i'm really going to value your opinion Luis.
        - Yeah, awesome.
        - Well, you know, that's I'm glad you reiterate that, again, Luis, because since you're the expert, we may be coming back to you.
        - Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions.
        - Thank you for the enthusiasm Luis about space. Right now we're just focusing on text based evidence. So it's awesome that you already have some background knowledge in this topic.
        - So did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew?
        - Okay um well I I circled the same as Farrah, which was the microscope I think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at Chris was just reading about.
        - Oh, that's okay. Well, we can always learn new things about topics. So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it.
        - Wow, great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our group, so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding, or all the things they want to know, okay?
        - Yeah, well, they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water. 
        - Yes, that is, I love that you already know a lot about space Luis
        - All
        - that's very cool I have not been to NASA i've always wanted to go that's really cool that you got to go.
        - yeah um I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Luis you know what.
        - all right awesome job Luis I like that you didn't.
        - Oh yeah, that sounds awesome.
        - um well actually I looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful Thank you so much.
        - you're right they do use all of those pieces of equipment, I want you to not let's not answer out loud, but I just want you to think about.
        - And you know i'm excited actually Luis to learn, you know from you and you learn from one another,
        - Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space
        - Maybe that you can teach the rest of us about
        - You do know a lot about space.
        - OK. Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this group so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better.
        - Oh well, Luis, and that's exactly why we need you in here. We need you in here to help help us out. 
        - um okay well so i'm in the article
        - And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA 
        - Background knowledge. Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us.
        - That's really good that you know all those things, Chris. Those are really good things to know. It's really interesting.
        - Okay, I can do that.
        - Well i'm glad you know a lot about space, and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our group conversation.
        - Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question.
        - I've never been the NASA. So that's really cool that you have that experience.
        - and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge.
        -  So, we could say, like all of the equipment for the answer.
        - Yes, and these are amazing tools and requirements that they have to be wearing before they go there
        - um I think it's good to talk about this what we read together, so we can help us help each other understand it more. So it's great that you know a lot about space. Maybe you can share that with us.
        - By 2024 yeah, that is, but I think it's totally possible 
        - Oh, you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this group, because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space.
        - Recognizes student background knowledge without a connection to text or task
        - yeah geology is like the study of rocks.
        - uh huh oh that's cool yeah.
        - So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too.
        - So when you got to see all of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use.
        - And you could help us to understand better
        - Oh, maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us?
        - You already know all about space that makes me so happy because we're going to be able to use your knowledge as an expert about space to help teach the rest of our group, so i'm going to definitely be relying on you Luis. So thank you for sharing that with me before we get started.
        - Yeah, me and my dad went.
        - I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there.
        - that's a really good point I you know I wish the article would have talked about that, I guess, I guess, sometimes the.
        - Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward. Maybe I'll have you been one of our group leaders. Okay.
        - And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the group. Okay, so
        - Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important. So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know.
        - Oh yeah, I know. Like, all kinds of stuff about that and I LIKE I REALLY KNOW ABOUT
        - Yeah, I can do that.
        - Okay, we are going to use your
        - You know all about space? 
        - Absolutely, and that I think that that would isn't, I mean everyone else might agree as well that that's an amazing inference right, you can think about.
        - Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information. 
        - Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space.
        - Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome Chris, 
        - They do. They use all of that. That's really great. So that's what we would call background knowledge. That's stuff that you know before even reading the article, and that's really awesome.
        - mm hmm yeah you're right yeah I think there haven't been astronauts on the moon, for a little while but they definitely NASA does send astronauts, I think, to the international space station regularly.
        - Thank you, Luis, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work.
        - But you guys did a really, really good job because you have their fantastic knowledge about space and about moon
        - yeah absolutely and i'm loving that i'm getting to spend some time with just the five of you, and I think we can all really learn from each other, like I mentioned earlier, with Luis.
        - and you'll be able to share all your knowledge.
        - Luis we need some space expertise and so it's always good to have you in the room anytime we're talking about space.
        - I thought so that's why I had to say it.
        - I guess what, if you could use some of what you know about space and maybe share that with the group? 
        - That is so awesome that you are telling me how knowledgeable you are now how motivated, you are in terms of subjects, so I can't really I can't wait to hear your response, and in fact I already heard you.
        - Oh yeah, of course.
        - Well, I was thinking that you know how I learned a lot about science is by I'm watching YouTube videos and and and watching the show on on on Nova show on PBS. So I was thinking that maybe Farrah needs to watch more more science videos.
        - yeah it was an amazing trip, we got to see so many different things there.
        - That's great. Thank you.
        - Yeah, I can.
        - Well, so, as you just said about yourself you're really an expert in this, and I really appreciate that you um.
        - Yeah, that's great. That's a great connection. How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that.
        - Oh wow, that's so cool Chris. Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks. How, what it does to look for the water
        - I haven't heard that so that's really interesting and that was that was good that you were like using what you found in this text along with what you already heard before so very interesting.
        - Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that. I bet not everyone has. I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the class.
        - You'd be a really great resource for us. So why don't you hang tight. 
        - cool always so interesting to apply your outside knowledge to what we're learning in class.
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in.
        - yeah you're absolutely correct they do use all that equipment.
        - And that obviously shows your understanding of space. That's really cool. 
        - and I would love to hear what you think about space.
        - um yeah I can do that sure.
        - that's great and I love that you already know a lot about space, but what I think is.
        - wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all.
        - Hopefully one day, Kevin. Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well.
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn.
        - For me response. You do know quite a lot. So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here.
        - Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates.
        - Oh well, that's great but we're you can help everyone else.
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class.
        - That is awesome that you know all the extra stuff. And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your
        - But that's really cool that your dad is an astronaut about that's that's fun to talk about
        - You know I know you know about space, I saw your response, about the oxygen tanks, which is awesome because.
        - and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text.
        - that's pretty cool, then you can you can be the reporter slash facilitator discussion leader, for your small group discussion is that all right.
        - There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space. Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA
        - Yeah I know all about it. My dad's an astronaut
        - yeah yeah i'd love to hear that.
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up.
        - yeah Okay, I can do that.
        - Yeah, that sounds great.
        - But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive.
        - that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that.
        - Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation.
        - Okay, I found it so it was in the um third paragraph.
        - maybe you can help your partner's out Luis I think you would be a great addition to our group.
        - I mean, obviously you need oxygen to survive. So that's a very good observation. 
        - Well, that would be awesome. I didn't know that you taught me something.
        - No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job.
        - have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used.
        - That's awesome. So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future, 
        - Yes, but you can help some of the other students. So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well.
        - Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space. So when we cover more about space. It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates. Right.
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right. Chris. Thank you for sharing with us. We all seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um
        - And that's okay, maybe you can help me help someone else later. Let's wait off on that. Okay.
        - Well that's actually really good that you say that Luis so since you actually know a lot about space, hopefully, you can help us in our peers get to the final answer How does that sound?
        - That is great that you bring so much knowledge to this group Luis and hopefully your knowledge can help the group to understand more about space as well, 
        - Okay so awesome. What you have Luis is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic. That's great.
        - you I bet you could definitely add a lot of a lot of strengths this group, a lot of knowledge to this group.
        - Now, Luis, our science expert.
        - Yeah I know but maybe you can help us. Okay.
        - Okay, yeah, that sounds great.
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way. Okay.
        - I can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer. 
        - Awesome. Well, that's really cool. And the fact that you guys know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect
        - Oh well, I really need you to stay in our group and and you can help me with like information and things. Okay.
        - um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right.
        - So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the group about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts.
        - How, okay.
        - Yeah. Okay, I can do that.
        - So, okay, yeah.
        - Oh Luis, you know a lot of our space.
        - So you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good, of how you know
        - No worries. So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and Luis You may know more about space than everyone else in the group.
        - So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things. And like you said you know a lot about space. So you've seen that they can use a lot of things.
        - That I love that. I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away.
        - That's awesome. You can help me out with the other kids. How about that once you just chill out for a minute.
        - Awesome Chris, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage. 
        - I know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits, cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space. And then they also wear gravity boots, so that they can walk on the moon. And I know that they have boosters that get them up into space. And then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to Earth.
        - Okay, that would be great. Thanks for for helping us out.
        - Thanks for sharing with us that your dad is an astronaut and I'm sure you do know a lot, but there's always more we can learn by reading and finding more details in the text we can always learn more
        - Absolutely good job way to think outside of the text.
        - that's awesome Luis that you have previous experience you know it's really important that in our group, we work together so maybe you can help out your classmates to understand this text, a little bit better.
        - that's a really good connection, so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there, thank you for adding that.
        - That's right. That's all really interesting information Chris.
        - Right, Luis, so you'll be able to share some information with us. And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay
        - yeah so that's great you bringing in outside information and love that very exciting and can help us have a bigger picture of what we're looking at.
        -  yeah Luis your answer really showed me that you have a lot of background knowledge.  
        - Good I will, I am glad that you're able to think about another experience that helps you relate to the text.
        - yeah and I think I love that you're coming to this with some background information from your own life and.
        - that's great well, thank you for hanging out with us anyway so we're going to rely on your expertise to help us even thanks so much.
        - People don't either So even if you don't need help you can still okay tell us some facts about.
        - That's great, Luis. You know what you gave me a great idea. I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper.
        - But I think that background knowledge that you have inside your brain is going to be a huge help.
        - Okay um I just want to make extra sure I understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer.
        - So maybe Luis, you can kind of help us here, then. You can maybe be our expert in the group and help the rest of us, what do you think about that?
        - that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so.
        - Oh yeah I remember our conversation from last time, when you were talking about how much you know about space definitely well.
        - Well, Luis I'm glad you are a part of this group, maybe you can share with us some of your
        - NASA as the United States Space Agency, and so in this paragraph Chris you're right and I like that you have that background information, but I want you to look back into paragraph two.
        - Okay um that there's no gravity in space, you know so like if you go there, you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero.
        - Yeah, cuz I mean, I read a lot about space.
        - Oh yeah it's so great you've been to NASA.
        - Well, I definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more, and even learn a little more yourself.
        -  Because we want to make sure that What we're talking about everyone has the same basis, understanding and you have outside understanding from NASA which is amazing.
        - Good. So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it. Or maybe you could see if your classmates. Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help.
        - Ya Sure ok, I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - yeah that's that's pretty crazy too thanks for sure that Luis i'm glad we have such a space expert here, so I was really excited to talk to you about this say I read a little bit about.
        - I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space. So Luis Can you help me understand
        - Specialist okay Okay, I guess, I could do that.
        - Oh wow you did a superior job like telling me all that background knowledge I love that how you visited there and site and how it made a big impact on you.
        - Oh, well that's really great. That's, that's awesome. That you know all about space. Maybe you can add to our conversation.
        - It's great that you have background knowledge, though.
        - That's super cool. I wish, I wish. I went to NASA. Maybe I might have to go there soon. Awesome. Yeah.
        - Okay, that sounds good.
        - Oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Already, so maybe you can teach us. You can tell us about it. Okay.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, sure. I'll tell y'all what I know.
        - Great. I bet that was-        - I've seen some of this equipment. That's very neat. Thank you so much, Chris.
        - Good. Well, even. I'm happy to hear that. You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share. So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it. Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about
        - That's a good point, okay I'll stick around.
        - See, so that's where you find your answer. Okay. So always remember that you have a lot of experience.
        - Right, so you really are thinking outside of the box. You're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us, you're thinking outside of the box. And thinking about the other equipment that they might use. Yeah.
        - I guess so.  Ok guys I'll be the reporter.
        - Um, so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely.
        - yeah I noticed that you have very specific details on oxygen tanks, which is really cool did you just.
        - Well, maybe you can help us out today I think we're going to need some help as we just take a deeper look at the text. Does that sound good?
        - Yeah, um, it's definitely good that you have that understanding and that you're confident in your knowledge about space. 
        - Because those are things that we might not know, but because you have that experience with NASA you're able to share that with us and I really appreciate it. 
        - If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space. Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this group to help the rest of us. And maybe we could learn from each other.
        - that's really cool I appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact.
        - that's great you must read a lot about space, you must learn a lot about it
        - Yeah, sounds great.
        - You are so right Chris yeah so in Houston here we have NASA too, and it is really cool really there.
        - Right it's all so maybe they if they have a base, then they could have water there.
        - Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group Luis
        - Oh that's incredible I mean it really shows from your response that you really enjoyed a science and to begin with 
        - That's really cool. Chris, I want to thank you for sharing your personal experience with us. That really helps us build on what we're learning. 
        - yeah no exactly, and that was really good that Luis brought up that they use on oxygen tanks, because it didn't say it in the text, but in order to be out in space, you would need an oxygen tank.
        - Maybe I can teach you guys some stuff. Yeah.
        - Well, just like last time you had something to contribute to the group. So we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more. What do you think
        - It's really cool.
        - Well, thank you for sharing that i'm really glad that you have all of this background knowledge already, and maybe you can help others in our group today.
        - For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks. Oh, nice. Thumbs up. That's awesome. I love that you know about oxygen
        - OK
        - yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch.
        - that's great you know it's at times it's actually good that you say that the more that you have knowledge on space, you know I think it's better to help us with
        - Oh, yeah.
        - that's pretty soon from now exactly.
        - Well, that is wonderful. I'm glad you know a lot about space, but maybe our friends don't. And maybe you can help me teach them Some new things about space.
        - That would be a good thing.
        - we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right.
        - Oh yeah, okay. Cool, yeah.
        - Yeah, you, you. There's always a way for you to learn more. Right. I mean, we learn from each other has been going on. Okay.
        - but thank you so much for sharing what you know about the equipment that is available at NASA.
        - You can give us more information. OK. 
        - that's great Luis I love that you're interested in space Maybe you can share your knowledge with the rest of the students. 
        - Oh wow I know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay Luis so we'll definitely be able to use some of your expertise in this conversation.
        - yeah yeah Okay, I can do that.
        - Well, maybe you can help the others.
        - Off. Okay.
        - That's awesome. That you know all about space. So you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article.
        - That sounds good.
        - yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard
        - Okay. Okay, so what I I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - that's fantastic that means you have an amazing schema which means you've lots of background information about space and that's going to help us today.
        - yeah, so I think you're right like because you went to NASA you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know.
        - Well, honestly, I think that you could be a great resource for your group members and you could help them, maybe like come up with our own answers, or maybe tell them what you think to.
        - Oh, awesome. Well, then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go. 
        - Yeah. Well, you're right. Chris and I really value that you have knowledge about this topic.
        - Okay that sounds good. 
        - that's great I love, how you have so much background information about NASA and what tools they use.
        - Luis, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about
        - yeah awesome that's that's a really great description of a space suit i'm really glad you have that experience Chris.
        - Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but
        - Awesome. Luis Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this group today since you know a lot about space. Okay, thank you for that. 
        - Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing.
        - Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this group then
        - Thanks Luis. I know you already know a lot about space, but not everyone has necessarily had that experience um, can you tell us        - 
        - With more information about what we're learning. Okay.
        - Well, awesome. I'm glad that you know all about space. Maybe you should can share some other things with your friends today while we're talking. Okay.
        - Do you want to share one thing with us that you know about space.
        - You can help you can be my helper. 
        - That's cool.
        - awesome so let's come back together right? Luis shared with us his amazing background knowledge, he knows a lot about space and astronauts and when they go up to space.
        - Well, you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of I might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with. So I think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our group.
        - that's very good that you have all this like information in your head, so I feel like well I don't know about the rest of the class, but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so.
        - OK, OK. That sounds really cool.
        - Luis, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them.
        - Good. But every time we learn something we continue growing and learning. So we are going to listen to our friends. Okay, thank you for your input. And I'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you. Right?
        - Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance
        - Oh nice it sounds like you know a lot about the equipment that scientists are wearing on their bodies.
        - Oh well, Luis that's awesome because you know what I had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this group.
        - And maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates.
        - yeah and I think that's great I think bringing your own first hand experience is wonderful and that's exactly what you should be doing 
        - yeah Okay, I only do what you were saying about Jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but.
        - Chris and Luis I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources. So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this. And I think that that's awesome. And no, you are not wrong.
        - i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge
        - Oh, I know a lot about space because I watch all sorts of YouTube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff.
        - Oh, then you can explain to your classmate then before you leave then.
        - Luis your dad is an astronaut. That's why you know a lot about space. 
        - Alright, so they definitely use a lot of equipment and it's so cool that you've gone to NASA that's amazing 
        - Your right and so, Luis, said the same thing, right. Luis What was something that you said that scientists use
        - Well, that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know. So you can help, help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too. So thanks again for work.
        - Well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new. You never know. Thank you for sharing that though.
        - Right, and I think it's great that you're bringing your knowledge from all the studies that you've done on space, which is amazing.
        - Oh, that is awesome Luis i'm so glad you are so interested in space, could you help maybe me, and some of your classmates learn a little about how we discover water on the moon, do you know how we do.
        - You're right, they do use a lot of different equipment. 
        - Well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space, but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too.
        - That's awesome. Space is so cool and I'm so glad that it's a passion of yours.
        - um well I guess we'll kind of what I was thinking, because a question was about the equipment.
        - Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question. Okay.
        - It's okay?
        - Well, thank you for letting us know Luis
        -  and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space.
        - Oh yeah I could definitely add that, to my answer.
        - Well, I love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to NASA before. That's really cool.
        - it's incredible isn't it Chris.
        - That it's pretty amazing.
        - Great. So, you, you, you're right. You do know so many different pieces of equipment that NASA uses
        - Maybe help your friends oh OK.
        - And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there.
        - Oh well, that's great so you can actually help our group and share everything that you know so that that's a great um you are a great addition to the group.
        - I'm sure they do and I bet that Luis could probably tell you more and you can share that information together.
        - Oh, of course, Luis, but we all want to benefit from your expertise, so you know we we like the opportunity to be able to to have you in the Group, so that we can ask you some questions, what did you think about the Lunar orbiter.
        - That would be pretty cool.
        - awesome i'm so excited that you know about space, therefore, you can share your knowledge with the class and help us grow.
        - yeah you do know a lot about space.
        - Oh yeah I know everything about space I watch all the videos on YouTube all about space I pretty much know everything there is to know
        - Luis you know I certainly welcome your input about space and i'm excited to learn about what you've learned about space, I think that we can all certainly learn from one another and.
        - Oh excellent I cannot wait to hear all that you know about space let's talk a little bit more about that Luis.
        - And needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut. Okay, we'll start over here with Farrah.
        - gosh I know that Luis you know you, you know a lot about space and you've learned a lot about space,
        - but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space.
        - So I could put that for my answer.
        - I sure did. 
        - yeah they do use a lot of equipment for many different things
        - or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on
        - Yeah. Yeah, true, very true. Very good.
        - And that's OK, sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper. And maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit.
        - So, could we put that in our answer too.
        - Oh, you were there.
        - That is really cool. Maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there
        - That's really cool. Thank you for sharing. And maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit, we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places, like maybe Luis's read other books about space, and you've been to NASA. So that's really cool. And I'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell.
        - that's so great to hear that we have people here that are interested in space, 
        - Oh that's very cool Chris.
        - That's great that you know that stuff. But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?
        - Beautiful I love that you have that background knowledge now we're going to try and take that back now rock background knowledge and connected to the text.
        - Oh, maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it. What do you think?
        - whoa whoa that sounds really exciting that definitely sounds exciting but definitely some you had some great things about there 
        - OK. Yeah.
        - yeah definitely scientists use a lot of equipment, especially, especially when they're going into space right.
        - Thank you, thank you for your answer, and thank you for explaining in case anyone didn't know.
        - And I really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this. Because like you said you know a lot about space
        - I know I'm sure you do. I know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books. I'm sure see movies or tv shows
        - Yeah, I went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff.
        - Right, so I don't disagree that you can learn a lot from YouTube, have boats, the scientists and astronauts and rockets.
        - Okay, so maybe you and Luis could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space. Okay.
        - That's good. So maybe today or in another class, you can share something that you have learned from your dad.
        - yeah that's great and so that fuel is really necessary Luis I know you know, a ton about outer space, and so you probably know that we need to fuel these rockets to get around outer space and so.
        - that's awesome so in your answer, it would be great if you could tell me a little bit more about your experience going to NASA and maybe tie that in to the article.
        - Like minds that you bring like i'm you touched on what Luis said about the mask I mean it was said about the oxygen tanks all those things are so important.
        - Whoo, that's fabulous. Maybe you can help us understand even more about space. So stay with this group, you might be able to help us.
        - Absolutely I love that you're making connections and that's so fascinating that you've been there and never been to another place, though.
        - Luis I think it's awesome that you know so much about space and I really appreciate you sharing that with me, 
        - Really Okay, so why don't you help us out what can you tell us a couple of things that you read in that article that you might have already known.
        - So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it.
        - Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away. 
        - i'm so glad that you know a lot about space, but I think you staying in our group would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good.
        - Okay, so we read it aloud. Right. You read it for us because you know everything about space already
        - Wonderful how. What a fun experience. 
        - Yeah, that's great background knowledge to bring to the table.
        - that's amazing i'm so glad that you're bringing in your background knowledge.
        - and also if we continue our readings outside of class, we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space. So the more we continue reading about it, the more we can learn about it. Okay.
        - Think it's good. So you can share your answers with the rest of the class because maybe someone might not know as well as you do.
        - Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material.
        - that's right that's right well you know i'm glad that you recognize Chris that it's this is.
        - Absolutely, I think that we could probably come up with a really long list if we used our brains and thought about every single little thing that they might need a might need.
        - Wow that's so cool. I really appreciate you sharing that with me.
        - yeah that's super true
        - Yeah okay perfect spot.
        - Right, so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that, and you can use that background knowledge.
        - so you'll be able to use your background knowledge to really help us understand. Okay?
        - I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that. And it will help you
        - Okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already, but I think you should stay, so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates. Does that sound okay?
        - You do. That's wonderful. Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently. So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better. Does that sound okay
        - yeah wow thanks for sharing that. That's a that's a great connection that you made with the reading.
        - Nice job, Chris.
        - Oh yeah I can definitely do that.
        - okay okay.
        - Now astronauts and scientists have to use all kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible.
        - Okay, well, it sounds like you know a lot about space, but you can stick around in this group, just to help everyone else learn what you know.
        - Oh Oh yes, I do okay my favorite thing about space is how Pluto it used to be a planet and then, then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company.
        - We're looking for something to find it, but that as a good point, thank you for sharing.
        - You know all about space so cool
        - yeah that's awesome and um hopefully you can bring some of that knowledge into today's lesson i'm excited about that. 
        - That's awesome. Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in
        - Okay, well, maybe you can help us. Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is
        - See you already have some background knowledge on this.
        - Well, I, hopefully, you can use what you know about space to answer the question, but I want us to think.
        - You probably do know a lot about space.
        - um how about you just maybe stay with us as a mentor or a specialist.
        - Luis You're totally right. You know so much in your brain about space.
        - Luis You use very good background information. We know that you know about space
        - Well, that's awesome. Now you can help the rest of your friends, learn about space too. So I think you should stay with us.
        - yeah absolutely I love that you made a connection to your own personal experience Chris and you were able to realize.
        - That's good, but you can still remain in the group to help the others. If you know a lot about it. Okay.
        - That sounds awesome. 
        - that's really cool that sounds like an awesome trip Paris and thanks for sharing yeah Oliver. 
        - Because we'd love to have you here, your expertise could help us all as well okay okay so um we'll start off with.
        - that's amazing so you will be able to help us navigate this question 
        - I'm sure it is. I hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon.
        - that's a really, really cool that's really interesting, I wonder, if it will happen, maybe it won't..
        - You do okay well you know what that's good because I don't know all about space and i'm sure some of your friends don't either, so you can be here to help us.
        - OK. What all do you know about space? Let me know, and that way, you can help me with the rest of the group, OK? What do you know?
        - Well, you know, I know that because last night we met with our class and we learned all about what you were interested in. So we're really glad you're here because you can really help us.
        - Okay Mister Luis. And that's a good point. I'm glad you know a lot about space
        - Okay, great, and if you have anything to add in about your background knowledge we'd love to hear it okay.
        - but you guys have some background knowledge and it's really good. I like what you guys came up with.
        - That would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have all this knowledge about it now because we read about it.
        - Well, even then, then you can sit with us to help the other students help understand the text a bit more
        - Awesome. Yes. So, and Luis was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment. Can we all agree on that.
        - facilities and museums and I think you and Luis probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing 
        - Okay. Okay. Cool. Yeah, I can tell you, all, all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard
        - Or is it something else that I actually can see in the text. So the next that thank you for adding that so Chris, you got, we have a. We have a lot of experts in this class.
        - um yeah Okay, well, we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon, and they found little pieces of ice.
        - Great. That was a good question.
        - Yeah, they definitely do use all of that equipment and that is a great answer. Chris. I also just want to make sure, similar to Luis I know that you guys have lots of knowledge about space and
        - OK, I'll do that.
        - wow that's awesome I love that you have that background knowledge
        - Luis I am sure you know a lot about space, but I was wondering, we were looking for the answer to the question.
        - I can do that.
        -  and if you have all that knowledge i'd love for you to share it with the rest of us, so I really appreciate you being here yeah.
        - It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading. And so Chris when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them. And so that's a great thing to share with the class. Does anyone else have an experience that similar?
        - yeah and that's amazingly important background knowledge that you know, we need to keep in our brain, especially one more understanding of what's going on and trying to see  How the scientists are able to find water on the moon 
        - Yeah. I mean, that's great. That's great that you have that background knowledge. I really appreciate you adding that to the conversation. I think that's really, really important.
        - yeah that's definitely really cool and i'm excited to see that 
        - That's incredibly exciting. I would hope that that's the case. And with water here that could help us in our future exploration. I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge. We know that Chris did visit NASA. We're very excited to see that.
        - yeah yeah scientists do need to use a lot of equipment or tools or machines to find and uncover things.
        - Yeah, sounds really cool.
        - Who maybe hasn't had as much experience learning about spaces you, you can share what you know with the group.
        - Yo, yeah. Yeah, I love space.
        - yeah they do.
        - Well, that is wonderful. Luis But we are still learning more information about space. So we're going to teach our friends. And so hopefully during the group if anybody else has questions, maybe you can help me, help them.
        - I know you know all about space I'm, I'm sure you all know a lot about space. 
        - And I'm so glad that's one of the coolest things I've heard in a long time.
        - Yeah, that sounds like fun. Yeah.
        - Alright, good afternoon students, I was just reading over your responses and what I noticed is that you all are doing a really great job answering the question, especially using some of the background knowledge that you know about space and about the moon. what, yes Luis.
        - That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes.
        - And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon.
        - And that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson.
        - Oh wow that's an incredible information I love that you're sharing the resource with us.
        - Thank you so much for sharing this sounds like you're a NASA expert will probably come back to you and get some more information, whenever we're looking for some of your expertise, thank you Chris 
        - Now that could actually help out with this next question.
        - Yeah, that's great. Maybe you can help your other classmates in if they have any questions they may ask you.
        - yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already.
        - And maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students. This might be their first time learning about space.
        - Wow, thank you Chris for sharing that incredible experience. I wish I could have experienced that. 
        - Oh i'm so excited you know a lot about space Luis you know I noticed that.
        - yeah that's very true Chris, I, like the vocabulary word geology you used, could you tell our friends, what the word geology means because you could you help us figure out what that word means.
        - Which is great i'm so excited that you have so many facts up there in your brain 
        - Right I love that you have some background information on that Chris that's great 
        - Knowledge and help us expand our learning on space.
        - I appreciate that, and you know I I really look forward to using some of your knowledge to you know help grow our students knowledge.
        - But I think Farrah by you being here, you can use        - your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing, because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment.
        - Okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that.
        - Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about. That's super cool.
        - Well, thank you, Luis, that will definitely help our conversation.
        - wow that's so cool so they have a lot of equipments, as you have mentioned, yeah.
        - So, Luis. You definitely have knowledge on this subject. 
        - Right, Chris and that's sort of what Luis said too, right? So that's great that you're using your background knowledge. Awesome.
        - Fantastic then you'll be able to contribute in ways that will move the rest of the group Thinking forward i'm glad you're here.
        - So interesting, maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer.
        - And I know that you know a lot about space. So I know that you can really help us out here.
        - Um, yeah. Okay. So I said no.
        - yeah I get I can stick around for that yeah for sure.
        - Yes, I remember you talking about how much you know about NASA and space and you think you've shared some interesting facts with us last time.
        - You went to NASA that's really amazing, and I think your contribution is also valuable, but right now let's try to find out the answer to the question that we're looking for.
        - Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
        - but you can certainly help even with your background knowledge.
        - Oh, okay. So you have some prior knowledge of space travel, right. 
        - right they do so you, it seems like everyone in this group has a lot of background information about space, which is great, so you probably, when reading this article, connected a lot to it which is really great, but when we looked at the text, it said
        - Oh okay okay well i'll be your teacher today guys.
        - Well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the group, so you might find some use there.
        - Because the fact that you were able to include your own experience in there is really awesome.
        - It's different. Some things are different. Now in school right and we're learning differently. And you guys have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners. Alright, so let's go back to our question.
        - Some final words like oxygen. And you know what an oxygen tank is and you know all the equipment they use
        - yeah that's actually I love that you brought that background knowledge with you and we can definitely add that into our answer.
        - Okay. Alright, well I'm glad you know all of that information. 
        - That's incredible. That's such a cool thing to hear about
        - I bet Luis could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?
        - Oh yeah, yeah, I think I'd be great to help on this question.
        - yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use.
        - yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic.
        - Cool. Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
        - yeah, I guess, I can I can do that.
        - So you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for
        - That's very exciting. It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,
        - Classmates said don't know so your background knowledge really does help. 
        - That's good. Thank you for saying the exact names. Well, that's exactly what I'm looking for, because you've been to NASA, you know all about it, but I haven't. And I love hearing what you've experienced. Yeah.
        - And Chris, that's really cool. So what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies.
        - You know all about space, Luis?
- intent: r110.4
  examples: |
        - Mm hmm.
        - I think you, you're absolutely right. It is find water. 
        - Yes, NASA used a small machine.
        - equipment and discover are two great words.
        - yeah, that's right. water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. 
        - Um, yeah, I wondering like, I think I'm still confused. Like why my answer is wrong.
        - Um, so, unfortunately, unfortunately, we, we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I really wanted to thank you.
        - I think that Luis just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future .
        - Words in paragraph three
        - And what I heard from you guys is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yes. That's exactly right. Nice work, Luis.
        - Excellent. So NASA see the machine and it's called a lunar orbiter. 
        - I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits.
        - Right.
        - A lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, OK, I see that make sense.
        - and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and 
        - Um well, so actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I want to say this was such a helpful class.
        - I like that. so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - Yeah, you are correct. There is, there is something new for us. We didn't know that we can get water on the moon. 
        - Yeah. So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter. 
        - That was a perfect response.
        - Yeah. Alright, so there's that. That's a, that's a good valuable reason to have water on the moon.
        - Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Yes Oliver. 
        - Oh wow, okay. Teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch, but wow I really, really appreciate how
        -  and you put it out perfectly. It could be useful in lots of ways. So it could be very important.
        - Mhmm. It's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water. 
        - Good. a lunar orbiter and it said that that was a small machine. 
        - Totally.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. I think a lunar orbiter is really key here. Right. They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon. Without that sort of orbiter right?
        - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. So did they use the microscope. I'm like, it sounds like they used it. So I guess. Did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope? 
        - Discover, that's great.
        - To look at the water.
        - Yes. Good work. That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon. Nice job, Jazmin. 
        - Correct.
        - Very well. So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said
        - So the answer for Farrah was correct one right.
        -  And yes, I was going to say the same thing is also that I, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Discover. Okay, good. What else?
        - Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need.
        - That is correct. You did very well. It's the Lunar Orbiter. That's how they actually examine the water and the craters. Yes, Farrah?
        - Absolutely. So we can use water as rocket fuel. Okay.
        - No that's a great point Jazmin I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text.
        - Okay, okay.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. Right.
        - That's the answer that I was looking for.
        - A tool. That's exactly right. So,
        - Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect
        - Yeah, I also know, like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea Thank you so much.
        - So, I mean, that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment, you know,
        - Right. Once they found it.
        - Exactly, yes. Jazmin.
        - Okay, so
        - Part Three okay.
        - Okay, so basically, I was gonna say, kind of like, I guess, kind of like what Luis said before, like I went to NASA with my dad and like I know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff. So like I guess I'm wondering, like, is that I guess that's not the answer, but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water?
        - Excuse me, must go on. I just looked at the clock, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say.
        - That's right. So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter. Correct. Good job. 
        - They did. So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon. 
        - That's right, they could drink the water in the future.
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.
        - so my answer with this. It was NASA send a small machine, but I was like why why is my answer wrong.
        - Investigated.
        - Oh, OK.
        - Exactly right. Yes.
        - All right, the lunor orbiter.
        - Yes, you are. Your right. 
        - Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water
        - Yes, lunar orbiter. 
        - Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good all right
        - That's right. Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment. 
        - Yeah definitely is very important. Thank you for for responding. 
        - Alright perfect awesome.
        - yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword, 
        - Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think.  Chris.
        - Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight Jazmin Luis and Oliver I think y'all were spot on.
        - Yes, you are right. 
        - Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel 
        - Yes, perfect.
        - but the Lunar Orbiter it's what they use to find water on the moon
        - Oh, so I just had to say the name
        - yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um.
        - There you go. So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters.
        - that's perfect Thank you Jazmin, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what Jazmin just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question Farrah or maybe something you want to add.
        - I think you're right, I think you do, 
        - That is right. That is a good job, Chris. Thank you. 
        - Awesome. So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon. Alright so next time.
        - Very good, very good. Jazmin so investigate. Okay. 
        - yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job.
        - Okay, that makes sense because.
        - You're off to a good start, like how you said he's a word from the story. 
        - Oh, absolutely would be expensive. Yes, Farrah.
        - Okay equipment to discover water and Jazmin.
        - Okay okay so um I guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the Lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer?
        - And you're right we so we do need that. 
        - Perfect. Great job, Chris.
        - That's correct.
        - Good. So it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool. 
        - It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, but you know it. 
        - You are correct Farrah it does mean really, really small 
        - yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools.
        - There you go. Discover water right so
        - I was in paragraph one, it says, water is heavy. And it says,
        - Well for me, I was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question.
        - Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable. 
        - Yeah, there you go. There you go. Perfect. 
        - Yes, which you did, so awesome. 
        - What's right
        - I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um.
        - The microscope. Great job. Jazmin.
        - That's what, that's what I think cuz is like investigate's like discover. So I think that's what they said discovered the water
        - That's great. That's absolutely right. So guys, I want you to think. So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So they were really small.
        - Awesome. Thank you for letting me. I think we're getting to the right place.
        - Yeah, exactly. Thank you for sharing Chris, so the water was found in this craters.
        - Sorry to interrupt. I was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go. So we'll have to see you later.
        - I'm okay. It's like when you got a space, you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star, and you're like, oh wow you know like I discovered her new star, I discovered a new planet like that.
        - To find water on the moon, and because.
        - So, that's awesome.
        - They still had to use it. Correct.
        - that's correct that's correct very good Jazmin 
        - Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes.
        - Recognizes or repeats a correct student response with no information
        - Thank you for that answer. Farrah. Thank you. I agree, it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is. 
        - Good. So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have, 
        -  Ya there's a sentence It says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where I found it.
        - yeah well um I said, I said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time. 
        - Which unfortunately we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun. Thank you so much.
        - So, how did they use that machine, though, because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate.
        - Yes, that's a great example Oliver, thank you for explaining that to us.
        - Good job, Jazmin. Thank you so much. Miss Farrah.
        - In the craters.
        - Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon
        - Great. So the small machine is the lunar...
        - OK, so that's what I should say? NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon?
        - There you go. And it's a lot easier to get out into space. 
        - amazing that is just what I was looking for.
        - Good split it in two parts.
        - That's exactly right.
        - Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,
        - equipment whoa that's really great 
        - Yeah, correct. Luis So the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Yeah, so that's that's the small machine. They sent 
        - Right, you use it to look at the water. 
        - I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go.
        -  yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use 
        - Oh, absolutely. That's how they would find it.
        - Great work. 
        - Yes, that's a great example, thank you Oliver for that. 
        - Just those two pieces of equipment. Okay, wonderful.
        - Yes, exactly. 
        - Yes, more details.
        - Oh that's a great answer Oliver.
        - Yes, it does. And I'm but yes you are. You two are correct. It is the Lunar Orbiter. So you are right there. 
        - Awesome. So you have the lunar. You're right. 
        - Or good Luis I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you. You're correct. So, good job.
        - Oh that's it?
        - Right. That is exactly right. 
        - Ok ok so scientists sent the Lunar Orbiter to the moon.
        - Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon.
        - Yes. So that is the equipment.
        - All right, Farrah, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater.
        - Correct. It was a machine called a lunar orbiter and Jazmin did a good job, remembering that it was a small machine.
        - Chris you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore. Correct.
        - So yes, that is one of the answers to that. The equipment was used to find water on the moon. So great job.
        - Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large
        - I think I already put evidence in my answer too.
        - Very good, very good.
        - I was thinking discover
        - nailed it yes Jazmin high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great.
        - Okay, awesome. So that is a great word to underline, did anybody else underline anything else.
        - Yeah, right I see that too, I see that too.
        - Okay, so a microscopic okay, so the lunar orbiter is what you use to discover the water
        - Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found. Mm hmm.
        - Yeah. No, you're right. Farrah that
        - awesome job Jazmin
        - You are correct. Yes, Jazmin
        - Yeah. Okay, great, great job. Okay.
        - Yeah, your right. 
        - Good, good, good. I know what I mean.
        - Bring their own right?
        - All right, very good. So it's a Oliverice that is used right?
        - I agree. So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important. So
        - So I heard a few of you guys say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine. 
        - A lunar orbiter. Great.
        - Lunar Orbiter. That is the small machine. Okay. That's right.
        - Fortunate we have to go to our next class. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us. This was really interesting. It was really fun to work with. Thank you.
        - awesome okay yeah I know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool.
        - um I mean, I guess, we could still use what Luis said Oh well, she said NASA sent a small machine for me, she could say um.
        - I'm still looking. like, why my answer is wrong.
        - Equipment I
        - yeah great conclusion. Oliver. what do you want to add?
        - Was that you. That is absolutely correct.
        - There you go, you got it. Okay, so
        - Yes, you're right.
        - Yes. So that's our topic is water, for sure. Okay, now
        - that's right, so we have the name of the Lunar orbiter 
        - Good. It could be useful in a lot of ways. Okay.
        - Yes. So the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens. Right.
        - yeah that is correct.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. 
        - And Ice deposits are frozen water.
        - Oh, and move. Yes, those are important as well. 
        - Yep.
        - We already had the Lunar orbiter part.
        - Oh, yeah, yeah.
        - To look at the water on the moon?
        - I'm so sorry. I just locked up a lot. And we actually have to go to lunch now.
        - Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment Jazmin.
        - Again Farrah kind of touched on it and her answer.
        - I think equipments an important word.
        - Yeah,  they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water
        - Good job, Luis.
        - Yes, and you need water to survive. Yes, you're right.
        - Perfect. Great job. 
        - Okay. And then the microscopic word?
        - Exactly and Chris, you got you got to that part. I just mentioned with Jazmin right that water is heavy. So
        - Yes, the ice is so small.
        - that would also count as a piece of equipment. Right.
        -  Exactly. And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - Ice deposits
        - I just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment. I was just wondering like why my answer was, was wrong. Because I like I feel like microscope is equipment. 
        - Correct. 
        - Good. That is exactly right. So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?
        - Polar crater. Okay.
        - Says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - And I just, I'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer.
        - yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know.
        - so Luis you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. That is true. They do need oxygen.
        - Okay, Jazmin, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine. Yes, they did. They did send a small machine. It was called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, that's absolutely correct. So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water.
        - That I guess I still don't know how come I'm in the group kiss my answer was right, I got it from the right place.
        - That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and
        - Okay, um, okay, y'all I so I get it because you you you told Oliver what it is, but, I guess I, I don't know like how how you got there. Like, I know I can say it, but I don't know how, how um
        - That's wonderful. I do believe that that is a correct answer. So, good job there,
        - That's right. 
        - yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great 
        - Correct. I would, I would agree with that. 
        - Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome. Oliver, yes.
        - Um, so what I'm confused though is, is my answer wrong, or is Jazmin's answer wrong? I said the microscope and Jazmin said the lunar orbiter.
        - Wonderful. That is great.
        - So it is very valuable and you guys are all giving me good answers on that. Yeah.
        - Equipment is a great word. Did anybody else put equipment.
        - Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon. That is excellent.
        - Well, I actually have a question.
        - Nice.
        - There you go. Yep.
        - Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer.
        - RER: It is a lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter 
        - Yes, thank you. Farrah. Thank you Chris for contributing that and for answering my question. I agree. I think equipment is an important word to focus on in
        - I think you've convinced me
        - A lunar orbiter. So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating. 
        - They actually use that to find it. Yeah.
        - You are exactly right. 
        - Exactly. It's discovering water on the moon 
        - Crater.
        - Um, that future astronauts could drink the water
        - Perfect. Great job, Oliver.
        - awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for. 
        - Right, Jazmin means to look for, right, or to discover as as the question asked you,. Yes, Chris?
        - That is the machine that collected the water 
        - that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine.
        - Okay, good. So we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good. Those are both very important. Yes, Farrah.
        - Oh wait, I have to add that part to this to discover water.
        - Water, and water.
        - Yeah, there you go.
        - lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment 
        - It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it.
        - The lunar orbiter. That's right.
        - Oh, Luis. Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom. So, um, you're right. Luis It is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Lunar Orbiter. Right. Correct. This is the. That's what we were looking for. 
        - Exactly. So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone. 
        - Um, yeah, I was just kind of wondering like, so I went to NASA with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff.
        - right there you go Oliveron or Oliver.
        - Yes. Awesome job. 
        - Awesome. Alright, so, Jazmin was back in the story, and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter. 
        - Exactly, exactly. So you're right. They do need a small machine and, 
        - OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter. So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment. Let me hear from Chris Chris, what were you gonna say
        - Okay, so, Farrah agrees, Oliver and Chris agree. Luis agrees. Good job, guys. All right. You can put your hands down.
        - Like, like, yeah, when you find it.
        - Yeah, that's exactly right, Oliver. 
- intent: r120.1
  examples: |
        - Well, I was wondering
        - What?
        - Who can answer that question?
        - And see if you can find something different.
        - I guess your I can try again. 
        - So what machine? Did they use to find that water?
        - Because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle?
        - Try again.
        - You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation. so when we're trying to find the water right, so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something.
        - Um, yeah. Okay. So I actually was kind of agreeing with Luis. Like my dad took me to NASA. And we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have, like, um,
        - so maybe just for answering that question, um can we like think of.
        - Farrah. I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see.
        - I wasn't sure. Like, why my answer was wrong.
        - And again, Luis, what was the question?
        - Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process. that might help you a little bit better.
        - Of the question, so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing. you have a really great start.
        - Um, well you did say that, um, you can't look if you're looking at the water than your, you have to first. That's the second stop. So then, um, I guess I have to look for the first step I gosh
        - Okay, I'll call on you in a second. 
        - Alright, so, from what I read what other
        - Good job. so based on the context of that on that paragraph, Jazmin do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer?
        - So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - Yeah, I think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and I think, I guess I'm confused, like why is my answer wrong?
        - I circled equipment. 
        - Right and.
        - Thank you, Oliver. So after reading that statement, What did we learn?
        - Is that all that they used?
        - All right. So why is it valuable to find water on the moon?
        - You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again. just take a second. there's no pressure. 
        - Okay. And when you get to that part, Please raise your hand and let me know. We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used. Okay.
        -  So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use.
        - Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that.
        - So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer.
        - yeah well, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go. But I was listening to what you're telling everybody else, and I think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer.
        - Okay just humor me. just a minute. I want you to take one minute. I want you to answer the question again. so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. go ahead and write your answer down. right your new answer down.
        - You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?
        - And so let's look back and see. So, Farrah and Oliveron. I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer.
        - The principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up.
        - Um. Is it the microscope? I'm not sure
        - Alright, so, Luis. Let's get to you. Alright, so read me your answer.
        - I don't see anything that said discover in the story I'll look again.
        - Okay, I'll read it.
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer. You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer. 
        - Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer.
        - Well, let's take a look. I want you guys to look. I know a lot of you that found your answer for microscope found it in paragraph three, and I'm going to read that to you real quick. Okay.
        - Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think
        - Okay, so what I want everyone to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon.
        - You told Jazmin that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so I think you told her that that was the answer right?
        - Okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us.
        - So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question.
        - and I have your answers so Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close. Did you see any other tools that you may need
        - Is there anything you want to maybe add to that.
        - I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it.
        - Yeah, I'll look
        - So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence.
        - Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger.
        - So, so
        - Um well for me I dont know
        - Hi everybody. So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - Good. Okay. So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon.
        - Um, what is the question asking us
        - Um, well. Like, I guess, I guess no cuz like I guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water.
        - So, Luis, and Jazmin. You guys have been working together and Jazmin, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?
        - Um, ah, You mean nothing like that what you told Jazmin about?
        - So I want someone else to answer my question again. Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time. So Jazmin, do you want to try?
        - So, Jazmin. Can you just tell me what that question means
        - but um let's let's keep building on that right good Jazmin.
        - What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though.
        - Great. Yes. So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that. Are you able to do that for me.
        - Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs.
        - Like, what is the machine?
        - Can you remember what was that?
        - So what about you, Oliver?
        - I'm not really sure.
        - let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water. 
        - If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine.
        - Oliver, can you add on.
        - Yeah. So basically, um,
        - Yeah, I guess so. Um, but I do know, like a lot. I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Number three. Read again number three. The paragraph number
        - Jazmin, what is the second heading.
        - Number three. Okay. I'm not really sure.
        - Well, I thought that was the correct tool.
        - Chris. Did you find that answer in there?
        - What Jazmin?
        - that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay.
        - Small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water.
        - Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use.
        - Valuable means like something that's really important. Like, um, um, yeah, something that's important.
        - Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully. Huh.
        - Oh no, I read the whole thing. I was gonna say the same thing that Jazmin said like when you're asked me to look for equipment. I found two pieces of equipment.
        - Yeah yeah discover
        - I'm not sure. Like, what would I add?
        - but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon.
        - I underlined it
        - Ah I'm sorry, Mr. Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong, too.
        - I'll try. OK. So the lunar orbiter sends-        - the lunar orbiter--
        - Uh-huh. Oh, you know what else?
        - Oh, oh, I didn't even I didn't actually say that they said, I just said that they sent a small machine.
        - Okay, do you have something to add to Farrah's answer.
        - Okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense, all look again.
        - What did you get out of the question
        - You guys look
        - So what's another word.
        - Um, yeah. Well, before I do that, I just wanted to say I'm Oliver
        - Yeah, because we could. Okay, so we should look for I should look for more equipment?
        - RER: Yeah, I'll try. I'll see what I can find.
        - Water is a valuable resource.
        - Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it.  
        - And then I want anybody to know if they want to change their answer.
        - Ah.
        - So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found.
        - What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it. Is there any other equipment that we need
        - But I want us to go back and look at that again.
        - What is the question actually ask us
        - it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include. Oliver what's up it's your turn.
        - So look back at your answer.
        - Right. But what else did you need to know?
        - To see if there is convincing evidence because
        - Was there anything else in the text.
        - So why don't you go back to your passages and You know circle some or go back to the question and read it again, and let me know if you have any questions. 
        - Yeah, oh look, oh look in the story again.
        - OK. So Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So look back in paragraph 3.
        - I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,
        - Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that Jazmin helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using.
        - They do, and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there. That's a very good point. But just like we were telling Mr. Luis, we have to find it in the text
        - Still confused because i i i guess why the microscope. Is it, you know what I mean is it an answer too?
        - Does anybody have an idea.
        - That wasn't Jazmin or Luis's answer?
        - Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey. Farrah I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer.
        - Yeah. So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research.
        - Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?
        - Oh well i i i had some equipment, but I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - water.
        - But what did they use on the moon to discover water. Do you know what that that tool was called
        - Okay, so we used to think it was the microscope, and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover. So I guess if I was doing this again, maybe I would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word
        - So we can go ahead and go back. I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up.
        - I guess I was I was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water, because craters are really big, right?
        - Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text.
        - When I say go, I want you to all reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate. Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home.
        - I see some few shaking their head. No. Huh. Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text.
        - You know I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - So Luis our science expert, out of paragraph two. How do we answer this question. What was your response?
        - Oh, the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So on there, you can make that on so again. 
        - Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay. So I want everybody to just look at paragraph two, and I want you to read along with me. Okay.
        - Oh um.
        - Using this strategy. How would you answer that question. No.
        - Alright so Oliver Can you help me out after reading the story again. 
        - but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing. Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon. Does that make sense Chris?
        - so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water.
        - Me? What do I think?
        - An answer for that.
        - Jazmin, you want to add something?
        - Let's see, Luis. Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over. Would you like more time?
        - Yeah, about the water?
        - Yet so basically so and Luis was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - I think we're all ready.
        - Um, okay. Um, so the scientists sent, what the name of the thing. 
        - Water. Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text.
        - So, Luis. Let's discuss your answer real quick. Okay.
        - That doesn't. Alright, so how. So how would you rephrase your, your answer.
        - Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon.
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text.
        - Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer.
        - So well I check in with Jazmin. Do you think that you could work on that a little bit.
        - But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool. Did they have to use
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so I had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely, you know, like at the water
        - um do you Luis or any of our other friends, do you guys know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about.
        - Okay, what else?
        - and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it.
        - Go ahead, keep going.
        - What does it say in the article about what machine or equipment went to the moon.
        - Does anyone else want to try the question again besides Luis? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time. Maybe Farrah, do you want to try it? Farrah, do you want to try. OK.
        - And
        - item that they need on the moon.
        - What do we think they used
        - What do you think this Jazmin?
        - Um, so my answer was, I guess no, that it wasn't very convincing, because kind of like what Oliver said like, we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time, you know,
        - Luis Let's talk about your answer.
        - teacher, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share
        - Allright Jazmin while you were reading. Did you find any more information.
        - You can, did you want to give that a try.
        - All right, Chris, um, what was, what was your response.
        - Can you find a different one?
        - You remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment?
        - Back at the sin to me.
        - Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, let's see, I guess.
        - Oh. So, Oliveron Farrah. What was the tool that they used on the moon.
        - So maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer. Okay.
        - Okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes. 
        - That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?
        - Then, then that means that they had to go there in order to find it.
        - Okay, perfect. So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for. 
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - Chris. Do you think you know it.
        - Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for
        - Keep reading. See what else you can discover. 
        - Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Give you time to think about it.
        - Oh there's tons of equipment well, they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship, they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use.
        - Raise your hand when you find find an answer.
        - I think the same stuff, like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that. I think they used the same thing.
        - Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment.
        - Yes, that is an answer. But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon. What do you think that should be a good answer to that question.
        - Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read.
        - but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water.
        - So re rethink about that. Do you think it would. 
        - Can you try
        - So Mr. Chris, Mr. Luis I want you to keep thinking and Miss to
        - Okay, so I found the answer.
        - Would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer?
        - Absolutely. You always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else. At that point, you've just got to find it in there. When you find something in the text, could you let me know.
        - A new answer?
        -  What do you guys think about that.
        - Okay. How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed.
        - and find those words in the answer and then um.
        - Remember, something else.
        - Um, well, I would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water. 
        - So Farrah and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and Luis I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used. Can you gues do that?
        - Prompts to try again without direction or additional support
        - Jazmin, what else do you think?
        - And that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me?
        - and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon. 
        - What else, what are some other benefits.
        - Yeah. So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out.
        - Well, I guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of, you know what I mean.
        - Chris. Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon.
        - Ok. What else?
- intent: r120.2
  examples: |
        - I'll say mine.
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? 
        - I just wanted to remind you, my dad's actually an astronaut.
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Like, okay, so like I went to NASA, like with my dad and like I like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what Luis was saying like I saw it in the exhibits. like I i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff.
        - We can go one at a time and give you our answers again.
        - So moving on to question number two it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Yes. What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Awesome. So we're going to look at the second question, and the question just to reiterate, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? 
        - So we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon.
        - when we are given a question, remember the question that you guys all answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? Remember answering that question?
        - Okay, so, Luis, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you guys had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, I think I got this all figured out. So now I'm all good.
        - What did they use to discover?
        - so First, I see a Jazmin could you share what your answer was? please am the evidence.
        - So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? 
        - That's right. So let's look at our passage and see what equipment Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Now you actually gave me the results of it, but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon? alright so so.
        - Good, thank you. I see that you guys have just answered your question. your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon. Yes. Luis
        - Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? 
        - What is the question? The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable? Right.
        - A scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon. The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay.
        - Yes, thank you, but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon, and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I was just. excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? 
        - So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - um so I know that we just talked about this question, right? what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon? and Luis.
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - considering our reading that we've already done, we're going to consider the question: what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay Luis It says, NASA send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Excellent. so i'm going to ask the question, one more time. What equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon?
        - All right, so let's talk about the question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? Everybody gave a different answer.
        - What do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - What equipment did the scientists use discover water on the moon? Okay.
        - So, yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment, 
        - All right. Okay. The question was we read our story. And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon. Right?
        - Teacher : So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon.
        - Let's do Jazmin, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Of you guys are going to look back over questions about convincing the evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - um yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - What I have a question for you, what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Okay, let's talk about the questions. One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon.
        - So what equipment that science use to discover water on the moon.
        - OK, so the stuff about investigate that makes sense.
        - Do you want to go first then Luis about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - um yeah I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Um, yeah. So I kind of know all about space already like, I don't think I need to even in this
        - So let's look back at our question. It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question.
        - So does anyone know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon.
        - So I'll read the question again for you guys but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So, Farrah, do you want to start with the question what equipment. It's scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright, so our question is,
        - How did you get that answer.
        - When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        -  And I think that's super cool. But the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon. .
        - Awesome. Well guys, I've taken a look at the answers that you gave to the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Mm-hmm. So how about we move on to the second question. Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - So I just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon. 
        - Oh no, that's okay. I was more of a comment. Really, I was just gonna say like, I don't think I have to be on this group, cuz like I kind of already know all about space.
        - Okay. So was there any other equipment that we used.
        - Okay, thank you. Okay, good. Good to see everybody. Okay, so I asked you what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Let's, let's go over some of your responses here, 
        - Was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Right. But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh yeah okay i'm so sorry I know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first, so I just said, I circled all the same thing, instead of repeating.
        - and let's look at the question. The question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon, right?
        - um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay.
        - get them on.
        - Right, who heard in that story what they use. What was the name of that scientific tool.
        - and our question again was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?
        - So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, please, can you please read the question again.
        - I guess, I was just gonna say that I, I I don't think that I need to be in that group, because I don't think I need any help because I already don't our space.
        - yeah I I understand. Okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - Circle evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - each of you individually, which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, and is Jazmin pointed out, oh sorry about Luis yes.
        - Yeah, I think you're saying like that. Yeah. So I know a lot of equipment, but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water. So I was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water
        - But I'm going to reread the question for myself and for the class what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Excuse me, excuse me. This is Luis. Um, I shouldn't be, and this group, I already know all about space.
        - All right, I appreciate it. Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Today we are going to look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright, so we are going I had asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - Awesome, thank you Farrah. Um so first, I just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick.
        - All right, you guys. So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Yes. Luis
        - So going back to the question right which so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So going over that.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.
        - So do you think it would be
        - Okay, thank you very much. Okay. And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        -  The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon.
        - So coming back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Okay. When we read that question. What are some words. And let's do
        - All right, so Farrah, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Alright, so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - well I guess it's a lunar orbiter um
        - let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Absolutely. This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - Yeah, there is a question. The question is, what equipment, the scientists use discover water on the moon. 
        - So do you all remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Good job. So we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon. 
        - So what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon
        - Yes, we do.
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that
        - Responses to your questions, or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Go ahead. Luis What's your question.
        - Awesome. So we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon. And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - OK. So we're going to discuss the next question. And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does anybody have any thoughts on that?
        - So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But let's look at a question. Again, the question is asked, What equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon. 
        - All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with Jazmin oh Luis you have a question.
        - I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Okay, was anyone able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon.
        - Yeah. 
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon. What equipment. Did they use to discover that water.
        - The question is, there is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon. And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text.
        - Chris, I see your hand everybody take a look what word, do you see inside of the word polar.
        - So going back to answer our question.
        - Well, I had said that they could do it with the craters. I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so can we look back in the text. I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
        - What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon. 
        - ok now so hello. You, the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes Luis.
        - Alright, so Hello everyone and, as you all know, we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon, is a desert, and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis.
        -  Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water. So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Keep in mind the question is, what did scientists use to discover water on the moon. After talking about the word investigate discover and look closely, what do we think the final answer is? what equipment did scientists use? so for this one i'm going to call on Farrah.
        - Did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Gotcha. Okay. That makes a lot of sense.
        - we had our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but the question was asking what equipment.
        - Okay yeah I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.
        - Why don't you start with what it, what. Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon.
        - So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon.
        - So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used Luis.
        - Miss Farrah I saw that your hand was raised, what, what kind of toll or equipment. Did they use
        - Hold on just one second. Okay. The question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon. Okay. So, Luis.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. OK. So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon. What do you think they sent
        - I got my answer.
        - Of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - yeah I said NASA sent a small machine.
        - I went to NASA.
        - At the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about.
        - So the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And we talked about equipment we have, like you said, the tablets and pencils. But what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - answering this question, or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon
        - Good. So now if we look at your answer to our question. Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And you said, NASA sent a small machine.
        - Alright, so go, I am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon.
        - Okay, so it says we're entering question. One question one is about the equipment. Okay.
        - So the question is also asking um what equipment, do they use to discover water on the moon 
        - So I'm going to start with this question. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money.
        - Okay, so where did they send this machine to.
        - And Chris, you can you please read the question again?
        - Okay, so now what does it say that they sent. What did they send to investigate.
        - Well, in a lot of ways that's right Okay, because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, so it would be cool to to if you went home and told your mom and dad about this story then to know what they used right so that's where the question is coming from because what if your parents asked you, what did they use. And that's what this question here is asking, what did they use
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the
        - Scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - Excuse me. I don't think I should be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - um well um okay well um I guess it's um I didn't circle anything in the reading um, but I just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon, I know they need oxygen tanks 100%.
        - What equipment is used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Can you help me figure out what tools that scientists needed to find water on the moon. Can you tell me one of those items.
        -  What equipment is scientist you discover water on the moon. 
        - Orbiter.
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - And the question. So two questions. The two questions that will, one of the questions that we had is what equipment did scientists you to discover water on the moon.
        - know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable.
        - for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what did you guys think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.
        - We've all read this article water on the moon from the New York Times, and now we're trying to answer this this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        -  So yes, they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks, but to discover water on the moon remember what they used.
        -  i'm sorry yeah I mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope, but I also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks, so I think Chris's right.
        - Let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Alright Chris your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof.
        - yeah right, I thought it was super cool to i'm wondering if we can go back to the question right, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, Luis
        - Okay, there you go. So what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So
        - So remember our question is asking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes Chris.
        - So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon. 
        - They said that you need a tool. Well, this was my answer.
        - So let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, well. Well, I had said that, um, I think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon. You know, when they have to wear their space, shoot. So, and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon.
        - So I like to go over. Question number two with you guys it we is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, so you can really look deep. Hi ya Jazmin yes. 
        - question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And almost all of you, I'm going to ask you to really re examine the questions That you're asked about what equipment to the scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Oh. Okay.
        - the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon.
        - So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover.
        - The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource. The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - So right now we are trying to answer the question, what equipment. 
        - Okay, so we're looking at, again, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. Yes Farrah?
        - I'll read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon.
        - Oh well, I guess, if something is so small that you can't even see it, how can you discover it don't you need to see it.
        -  so one more time, will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them.
        - Through the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So we've got a new question that's is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be invaluable.
        - Um, so I think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff, because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around.
        - . So let's reread the question.
        - And turning our attention to that question and you all have read, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So the first fact is that
        - And while you're listening. I want you to be thinking about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover
        - What equipment did they use. 
        - OK. So I said that water could be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Because, remember, my dad's an astronaut. LAUGHS
        - I was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as Farrah.
        - But I want us. But the goal. And the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon, 
        - So today we're going to talk about after the reading, do you think that water is a valuable resource to astronauts.
        - was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - Well, said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - So you guys answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Does someone want to. Oh. Luis You have your hand raised. You have a question.
        - They used that equipment to keep themselves safe in space. But the question for discussion is what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I alreadyknow all about space.
        - um so we I just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - All okay oh wow.
        - Sure. Great question. So let's look back at the question we're going to answer. And I think that might help answer your question, Jazmin.
        - I wish we had time to hear another answer, but actually we have to go to lunch, but this is a really fun class. I don't want to end.
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What was the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon.
        - Because we need to know which
        - Alright, so my first task that I would like you to do. And I'm going to give you a minute to do this is I want you to reread the question. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So when you read it, you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. Very good. 
        - Sure, no problem. OK, so my answer was, you need to see typical color microscope to look really close.
        - Oh yeah. Um, so I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        -  mm hmm okay so well, first, I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they both were talking about equipment on so since you said Jazmin had the right answer I think it's a lunar orbiter.
        - So I want you to take a look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Awesome. We talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable. 
        - So, question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Okay. That's our question to
        - Yes, in response to the question about what equipment was used to discover water.
        -  i'm excuse me, I should be and best group I already know all about space.
        - Yeah, sure. The question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon? Oh.
        - So I know that first up, we have the first question we answered in our journal, which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, since we're talking about equipment, I wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Oh, I was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon.
        - Hi Everyone, so our question today was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, alright. So thank you again for sharing all your answers. Okay, so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Okay. Do you have the text in front of you.
        - mm hmm so let's look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable 
        - Perfect. And what equipment did they use
        - No, we're good. Okay, so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yeah, yeah. I thought, Farrah said they use like a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Is there convincing evidence that there's water on the moon can be valuable.
        - But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water
        - What Farrah said?
        - What equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright, so Hello again so right before lunch, we were talking about how, in this question, which I will read again quickly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So you answered the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - A small machine.
        - It would be a good answer to the question, right. Let's look at the question again.
        - Yes, all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water Farrah.
        - because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and
        - Oh, we can possibly answer that. But unfortunately, we have to go to my next. Thank you so much for working with it. Thank you.
        - But we want to look back in the article and say what tools they used on the moon.
        - So we can strengthen our skills. So the first question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Important to have water on the moon.
        - Okay. Well, you said that it was what Jazmin and Chris said, but I, I don't understand why me and Farrah are wrong. 
        - yeah okay um excuse me teacher, yes, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - So let's look at your responses. So the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. Right.
        - Wow, I'm sure you know a lot of space. But let's go over what our discussion question was, and that question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so everybody has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - In the question. It says, Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable. 
        - Could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment, did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon, 
        - I thought it was pretty easy.
        - So Chris, they you, What did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters.
        - So, initially, I gave you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Where did you get the question is what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - The question that we're thinking about today, that is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Whoa, I guess I kind of like, Um, no, I just saw the microscope.
        - Thank you. Um, so the question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - A lunar Orbiter
        - What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - I want us now to spend the same amount of time thinking about what the second half of the question is, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what if I put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was
        - So the question is, what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, we've just answered what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - um well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits 
        - It doesn't say circle, the evidence in the text. That we can use to answer this question. 
        - Okay um so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Oliver I appreciate the hand up everybody look back at your paragraph who found that water.
        - So if you're looking at the question we have what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - I guess I skipped that part.
        - Yes, we did, we all, yeah
        - So the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon. So have all you thought about that?
        - What is that piece of equipment they used to discover that teeny bit of water?
        - Right Okay, so we have the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What would you change your Institute
        -  So I'm going to say the question one more time, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - microscope
        - What equipment do they use to find the water. So while I'm talking to
        - It was, is there. What equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        -  the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Um, so I want. Yes. Luis
        - So it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon Could be valuable.
        - and wait I just so with with my answer about the machine, why what        - I still don't get why I was wrong. I said NASA sent a small machine.
        - Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate. This is the one that Chris just read right?
        - Let's recap. Question one WHAT equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. What did we decide
        - I'm so I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we do have to go to watch. But before we go to lunch. I just really wanted to thank you for
        - because the question was what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.
        - The, the question was what equipment was used to discover wate.
        -  I just want to make sure that you see all four components in there as well.
        - I want you to go back and look at the question, so the question says is there convincing evidence that water can be valuable. OK?
        - Our question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - We're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable. 
        - Let's pause and let's let everybody look at the question. Question number one. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        -  yeah and so i'm just wondering, because I know that's the question and my answer was NASA send a small machine and X equipment and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Find text evidence, just as you were doing in that first part of class to inform this answer. 
        - That is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great Jazmin Thank you.
        - Now the next question we were covering  Is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Going back to the question what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, I think so.
        - Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water.
        - All right, come back together team. Now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage, let's review our question again. Okay? What was the type, what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon?
        - Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - um so earlier today, you read about water on the moon, and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and you need to just circle, the evidence in the text.
        - Right, they want to know what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - My name is Teacher . So you guys just answered what object did-        - I'm so sorry. What equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon, right? OK. 
        - I I like what you gave me there Let me read the question, one more time and then I can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry Oliver, yes
        - Okay, so what we went before we went to lunch we were talking about our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Exactly. So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?
        - lunar orbiter.
        - But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water. Does that help?
        - But how did they discover water on the moon?
        - but then the question is, is there any evidence that water can be valuable 
        - yeah what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon.
        - You know that, um, but I'm just going to direct you to the question, which is Scientists us to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value.
        - What else do people think is water valuable why or why not
        - Yeah, definitely. Because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, thanks. OK. So our question that we're going to talk about this time around is
        - On that water right, we want to figure out what tools or what equipment, do we use
        - Right, how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon.
        - Just so I can make sure that everybody knows what the question is um So the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So we just talked about how equipment and discover are two very important words but what I want you to do is identified the specific piece of equipment that they used 
        - i'm trying to and I love to teach I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - so when we read our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - and let's listen keeping the question in mind, the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh. Thank you, Luis. Right now we are not talking about space. We are talking about including evidence to support our answers. So do you have anything to share about including evidence?
        - First Okay, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Alright, we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - So today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, so thank you all for sharing your answers.
        - What, we're going to look at the question. The question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Talk about what they said. For when they answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon.
        - That is also a really good point so let's go back to our prompt and want everyone to look at and see what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - That's great. So after you guys read the article, we have the question to talk about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Oh, good. So I just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And then we had a circle. The evidence in the text, so that we can answer the question. 
        - Well, um, it says that there's water on the moon. And what is valuable because you need it to drink.
        - So let's talk about the prompt. We were asked you guys what equipment and sciences us to discover water on the moon. 
        - We are, but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, 
        - Okay, so is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable. Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable on the moon?
        - What equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Well hi this is Chris, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Excuse me, Miss Brown? I'm sorry to interrupt.
        - Right. But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?
        - To find water on the moon?
        - I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.
        - Water on the moon, and you have answered your question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Oh, oh yeah um so.
        -  did you locate the machine that found the water on the moon, the name of that machine, Chris.
        - Alright, seeing no hands. Let's begin. We all have answered the same question, which I'm going to read. Now what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right. Okay. So, and our question said that NASA. They sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment. Did they sebd to investigate water.
        - Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.
        - So, who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Moon could be valuable. 
        - Good. Has everyone had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon.
        - Lunar Orbiter. That's right. So what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon.
        - With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon. 
        - I forgot again oh man hold on.
        - So now, we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, I've read your responses to our question. Let me read. Let me reread the question again.
        - What equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - awesome so I noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and all of you had great responses, yes Luis.
        - Let's read the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - What took equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon.
        - So we've just read the article water on the moon by the New York Times, and now we're analyzing this second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        -  On well, I would still say the same sentence, I said before, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it.
        - yeah yeah so I I thought it was a microscope because I read this part where it says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, so we were asked what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon
        - So I know I know, so the question said, is there evidence that water can be valuable.
        - But so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So let's look, all together, we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter.
        - Alright, so our plan for today is that I am going to give each of you guys some time to read over your responses to the question that I had originally asked which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence.
        - What equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon 
        - The first question, I saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So here if we go back to the question, what kind of equipment scientists used to find water on the moon, so what is our answer?
        - It said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon. Now, have y'all already thought of your answers for this question?
        - Yes, I think it was a small machine
        - Alrighty guys welcome back from lunch. We're going to start with a new question. All right, so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - Well, okay. So here's what I know is like probably they had to use like I'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use, like, stuff like that. Like gloves and like helmets and things. I think that's what they had to use
        - Alright, so we just talked read the article water on the moon. And the question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. Um, so my question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Okay, so, um,
        - Right, so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon.
        - Oh, it means that like
        - Oh, okay, yeah, I guess not.
        - The discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover?
        - Okay, but we're going to what equipment. Did they use to find that
        - All right now. So the question is, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Right.
        - We're just trying to help. Luis remember what the lunar orbiter was
        - I just wanted to clarify what the question was, so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the, on the moon could be valuable. Now your answer, yes Jazmin.
        -  Okay, I got NASA sent a small machine and I found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two.
        - Have I said that they use the microscope.
        - Okay, so now moving on to the second question, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon, excuse me, could be valuable.
        - All right, so we just talked about, and read the story on discovering water on the moon, and the question was what did they use to discover the water on the moon. 
        - To my question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - So let's look at the question again, it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Because it's microscopic awesome Oliver. 
        - So I'm going to reread the question for all of us, so that we can hear it again. The question is, what equipment did scientists, 
        - And in your question. If you can take a look at your passage. All of you can take a look at the question again. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, yeah, I mean like like Jazmin said out people need to be able to drink water. Um so yeah that's valuable.
        -  Well, I know, after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks. 
        - OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer. So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? 
        - The question that's being asked. So the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Wonderful. Okay. Well, let's look at our discussion question.
        - but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - I think it's the microscope. But I guess since we're in this group. It's not the microscope, but I thought it was the microscope.
        -  Oh well, so this isn't what I said for number one, but now I realized number one is talking about equipment.
        - Well, we came to the same answer, basically.
        - Um, well, I guess I'm not sure.
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. What are the key words in that question. I'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - What equipment that they use to find water on the moon.
        - So let's look at our question. Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - So the five of you just all told me what your response would be to the question. So looking back the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon. Jazmin's answer was, NASA sent a small machine.
        -  So the next thing I would ask you is when you read the actual question I'm going to read the prompt. One more time.
        - Well, so my answer was, like, they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits. And like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space.
        - Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment.
        - So we're going to focus on the question, what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes Luis.
        - Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so
        - All together, we're going to go back to the question.
        - What you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find
        - Um, yeah, I should be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - So if we look back at that question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - You as well. So our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Yes. Luis Do you have a question.
        - Repeats or restates the discussion or their own question without additional support
        - Our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Scientists did use a microscope to look at the water that they found. But the question was asking what was used to discover the water on the moon. So the microscope was looking at actual droplets of water after it was, the water was discovered. The question was, how did they discover the water on the moon.
        - So going back to the question.
        - Circle that evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - Yeah, I'm going to read the question. So listen closely. Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon.
        - Who was that Luis what is it called.
        - I'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So let's look over our initial questions. So the first question as a group is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Hey, I'm sorry. No, I will wait. Go ahead.
        - Okay, you think the most important words in the question.
        - And so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Now let's see is, does anybody want to share why they think water could be valuable?
        - For everybody so feel free to answer. And the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text.
        - All right. All right, guys. We're moving on to question number two, which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Well, they will need it to help them breathe, but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon.
        - So I saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space, but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon.
        - For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon.
        - Because we want to know what good scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - yeah maybe we can glue all of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable 
        - The question is, what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon.
        - So I want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - What that means is the question was what equipment, we used to find the water on the space on the moon, and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water.
        - Um, well, I was just gonna say that. I know. Like all the stuff about space. So, like, I don't really think I even need to be in this group.
        - awesome Thank you Farrah for reading that out loud, for us, so the question is saying what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Hi guys. So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question. Yes. Luis
        - Ok. Ok. 
        - Before even before I answer your question. I'm just gonna review what we're going to go over. So we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. We're going to talk about that Luis what's your question.
        - All right, so here's my first question, what tools and equipment. Did you see that the astronauts were using in space.
        - Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Okay, go ahead and write your new answers down.
        - Let's start off with rereading the question. So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, I was just gonna say like I already know like so much about space and like I don't really think I need any help. I don't think I should be in this group.
        - Alright, so does anybody want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover? 
        - So let's look back at our question. It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - All right, thank you alright so again, we have that question about what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Right now we're trying to figure out exactly what piece of equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Okay, so, um, you guys were asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - How can we bring all of that together, to then say what truly right what tool was used so that these astronauts could discover this water on the moon, what are your ideas?
- intent: r120.3
  examples: |
        - Oh yeah, sure. Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Let's see, Chris. Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two?
        - yeah, I would like to because this is where I found my answer. it says.
        - um yeah it is. it's right here. it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        -  But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again?
        -  Okay. So could I have someone. Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read. Question number one out loud for us.
        - They, I guess they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it.
        - let's all take a look at that part of paragraph two, there. right at the beginning NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate. this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh yeah. I could, I could write the whole sentence. nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that. is that right?
        - Okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon?
        - Yes, those are great equipment words. OK. Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those? Jazmin, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine?
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.  Okay.
        - That means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth.
        - Excuse me. on i'm so sorry. I really don't want to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and.
        - but anyone read it out to the whole class. Luis, could you please read it, for us, the first sentence?
        - The question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Sure. Okay. It says, oh, what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading. And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us?
        - Oh Okay. so can you keep going and read the next sentence?
        - And it can you continue for the next two sentences.
        - In in writing those responses, so what I want everybody to do is I want you to read the question, one more time. 
        - yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text. just see where can we find this evidence in the text. 
        - I think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read.
        - Oh. I'll read. Can I read?
        - Yeah, okay. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have.
        - For the third call, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic Microsoft
        - And I want to challenge, just like Chris, take a look at that question. Can you read the question for me?
        - Oh yeah it says, or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon?
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three. Look at paragraph three.
        - It says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater. 
        - Chris can We go to paragraph two,
        - Good now let's look at the second paragraph together. NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. these ice deposits are very small.
        - So if you look at paragraph number three. And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three. I'm going to read it. You follow along. Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth. The water they found is, what's the word there?
        - The water or identified the water. so let's all go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds, maybe 30 seconds.
        - Okay, I'm
        - See if you look straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon. South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater. These deposits are very small.
        - yeah. so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three. let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use.
        - Of work. This would hold only 32 ounces of water.
        - is actually showing the text but Farrah I want you to read the question more closely. So what does the question ask us?
        - I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so Chris. Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer.
        - But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, Chris
        - Yeah, you're welcome.
        - Can you read the sentence before that Chris.
        - It says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater. Okay.
        - So let's look back at
        - Yeah, we all have it on our tablets.
        - Let's look at the third paragraph. Does anyone want to read that for me.
        - So paragraph three. Who would like to read three?
        - Okay, so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - yeah I want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says.
        - Um, okay. So should I should do the part that I circled
        - Well, that's fantastic. How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it.
        - Paragraph two. 
        - Okay, so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.
        - Okay, um paragraph two
        - Okay, so, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I'll read it. I'll read it. Ok. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh, so it says this Lunar Orbiter. Will look for deposits.
        - I will, I will just be about, like, I was wondering if this was maybe the answer is NASA use a small machine to get to the water. This is that a good answer.
        - Okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon, so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - In paragraph number two. The first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface.
        - Exactly, so what I want everybody to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together.
        - So, let's go back up the text has one, two, and three. So in looking at the one, two, and three, they're short little sentences.
        - Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, now I'm going to stop there.
        - All right, Farrah, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one
        - Go back to the text and look
        - Gotcha. You need a scientific
        - Like Oh, they want me to study the surface and don't know.
        - All right, who would like to read the first part there.
        - that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more.
        - Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas
        - I'll we know NASA has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small. 
        - Want me to read, read, where I got my answer from or you want me to read where Jazmin got her answer from?
        - That you're on the right path right, and so I want you to do the same thing as Farrah just looked at that text because again.
        - It says NASA such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay, thank you for responding Chris so i'm wants to go back and I think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so Chris, if you can look at the third paragraph and I want you to just, would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph Chris?
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Can you look back in the text and see
        - Okay, so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind. I'm going to read you this paragraph. Okay.
        - Can you read paragraph two for me.
        - circle, the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question.
        - So why don't you read that question for me again.
        - What does it say on paragraph three, about the microscope um can anyone start reading with the sentence that says, the second sentence and paragraph three Farrah.
        - All right, go ahead and look backward in the text, what about the rest of us.
        - And then also I would like you. We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question. So can you read back the question for me.
        - Microscopic's kind of like really small.
        - And the next part of the question.
        - The lunar orbiter, in paragraph twol
        - But in that first paragraph. it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon. Oliver.
        - Okay. Um, let's see.
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle.
        - My answer came from paragraph two. I still don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Totally, so we're going back to the question, so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon, 
        - yeah definitely definitely agree, so the universe is so mysterious, and there is very large space for us to explore. So um, do you know what is our question for today?
        - go right ahead.
        - Can you read the sentence that you found that in. I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence.
        - Okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud, for me, can you do that.
        - Can you reread the question to me.
        - yeah you got it Okay, that means that the moon Estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - All right, you all gave such great responses to this question now, I just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it, and if you could just follow along yes Luis.
        - yeah thanks Luis go ahead and read paragraph one for us.
        - And then also I want Farrah Oliver and Chris, will you guys look at the fourth paragraph and then Jazmin and Luis will you guys look at the bottom, the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph?
        - NASA send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters. Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage. Can you look at your passage with me.
        - mm hmm so let me read that part, the first part, or part two together so NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh yeah, absolutely. Okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways. Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Yeah okay. What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two, can you can can Jazmin use that paragraph two, can you read it out loud for us.
        - Um, yeah, okay. So question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water. Water is heavy. And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - and specifically what is the sentence say.
        - yeah well Actually, I have a comment it's that I, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - It says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And Jazmin. Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        - question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon.
        -  but Luis can you read the question for us, do you have it.
        -  Everybody look back with us and Jazmin read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine.
        - Says the orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2.
        - In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah
        - Now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can anyone read for me the question that we need to answer.
        - Oh, interesting. Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out
        - Okay, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - Let's look back at the text. Okay. Okay.
        - Okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon. Okay, so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon. 
        - and Jazmin can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again. 
        - um yeah excuse me.
        - Alright, so let's read the question, what does the question say
        - Let's move on to the last one. That means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on Earth. 
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways.
        - Um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you guys in your groups you guys can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay.
        - Okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so Chris, would you go ahead and read the question to us.
        - so to keep going around Chris, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one.
        - There is paragraph two, could you go ahead and look at paragraph two
        - All right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?
        - We can read super fast, so we we did our two minutes.
        - All right. Well, let's look at it together.
        - yeah that is that is 100% correct, but can I have somebody read question one out loud for us again.
        - Very small.
        - Okay, so that number two we just read, read
        - Yeah. What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - there's a little bit more keep reading.
        - Look at that question again.
        - Oh yeah, I can do that.
        - awesome great yeah we does everyone see in the first sentence and paragraph two, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods.
        - under paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning. It wouldn't be able to see
        - yeah Okay, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So, in, in paragraph two, what does paragraph two say?
        - So if we read, question number in the first response. So scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters. These creators are dark places where the sun never shines 
        - In the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time. The moon is a desert. But if you go to the second paragraph, and the very first sentence. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - I'm gonna stop you there. We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        - So we are going to look back in our passage. So I will everybody to get back into their passage
        - All right. Can I get Oliver to read the question for us, please.
        - Excellent Jazmin could you read the second paragraph, for us.
        - And so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were, if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, yeah. So um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay, awesome. So we're going to move down to paragraph number three. Can you all find paragraph number three.
        - These ice deposits are very small. And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth.
        - Let's look at Paragraph two, where NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - Water on the moon, I want us to take a look, though back at the question that was being asked and I want us to think about oh yes Luis.
        - Yes, just take a second and reread it.
        - Well, I was just when you say I wasn't sure why.
        - Yeah, the one starts with that the final sentence there. My apologies. Oh.
        - OK. Scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth.
        - Great response. So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, Luis.
        - Jazmin: That's where I got my answer from
        - I'm
        - Okay, let's see.
        - Yes, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - All right, so, Farrah, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading. Can you do that for me?
        -  um excuse me.
        - Sorry to interrupt Mr Teacher. But I was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later. Okay.
        - What's that say
        - Okay, all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay.
        - But we look back at the question for me. Luis It will you read the question back to me.
        - Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so
        - Huh. Yes, it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Can we look at test again and.
        - The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate
        - I can read it.
        - yeah, so why don't we take a look at paragraph two together so can everyone take a moment and maybe just reread paragraph two, to yourself.
        - yeah yeah I can do that right before it says Okay, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.
        - And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, Farrah and and the group. If you look at their paragraph four.
        - The water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us?
        - Microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need to scientific tool called the Microsoft look very close 
        - So why don't we all work on that together. So could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me Luis.
        - Okay, well I got my answer from paragraph to I don't know what's wrong with mine.
        - Yeah, but my answer is in paragraph one, it's not in paragraph three
        - How about we look halfway down. Do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton, you see that sentence.
        -  can I have a volunteer to read this question out loud, please.
        -  so once again can Oliver can you read the question, one more time for me.
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - And it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small.
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - Know, you'll be used the um the microscope. Cause that was my answer was a microscope. Yeah.
        - The scientist, it says that they need a microscope to look closely.
        - All okay
        - Let's look specifically at. Well, I'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself, NASA send a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits
        - Okay, so let's go back at a our article, so everybody look at your article. Farrah, you had a great question there. Okay.
        - So you just answered a question about, I'm not exactly sure what it was with someone like to raise their hand and tell me what you just read and what you just answered, Luis.
        - Keep reading, what does the next one say?
        - Yes, out loud.
        - Okay, so go ahead and read that last sentence for us.
        - why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time, can you read it out loud for me.
        - Just the first one.
        - So see, let's see if we can look back and find the answer in the story.
        - So the water they found is microscopic and it says, meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it.
        - We learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines. NASA, which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon.
        - adapted from the New York Times that piece you read, I want you to go back, but I want to see if we can flesh out what Jazmin's talking about here.
        - So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response.
        - can you reread that chunk of the text for me.
        - Okay. Well, you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and all that good stuff. So can you read to me, please. The second paragraph, under the moon is a desert.
        - Can you read that. Yeah, read the next sentence.
        - And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - But I would like, for you to reread for me, the first sentence of paragraph three, can you read that allowed for us Chris.
        - will you reread the question for me.
        - So we need to look and paragraph number two.
        - Good cool all right, so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon, and so our first question, can I was wondering if someone can remind me Luis you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us?
        - Oh, yeah, yeah. For example, future astronauts drink this water. Water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft
        - Can I read it Okay, the second sentence.
        - yeah it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - If you guys can all look at that second paragraph that starts with the word NASA.
        - So if you look back, paragraph two, can you read that for me.
        - Okay, great um Luis do you want to read that paragraph three, for us, maybe just focusing on the last sentence there. 
        - Yes, so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, can you read the next sentence out loud, for us, please.
        - That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day. 
        - Okay, and can you read that out loud, for us, please.
        - So now reading number two, so NASA send a small machine called lunar over order to investigate this order looks for ice deposits in large polar craters. These ice deposits are very small. 
        - Would you be okay to read the final sentence there. Oh, yes, yes. Jazmin.
        - It is water on the Moon. The Moon is a desert.
        - So I think we all need to reread the passage. Okay, one more time. I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again. Okay.
        - You, why don't you go ahead you and Farrah, why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, that's interesting. Um, I wanted to point a specific area I wanted us to read together. Um, can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me.
        - Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - So on the first text it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within moons create polar craters us craters are dark places that the sun never shines. 
        - awesome I am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely, if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes, starting now to read.
        - Teacher : The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called or microscope to look really closely. So, Luis, or Oliver. I'm sorry.
        - yeah well that's the cool thing about this text, so it kind of explains it um Chris, do you mind reading section two out loud.
        - Okay so reread that
        - Yes. Good. So let's keep reading paragraph 3, and then we're going to go back, and we're going it's kind of getting more information, OK. But that's a very good start. Very good. So paragraph 3. Who would like to read 3? Chris, would you like to read it?
        - yeah Okay, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Good. Let see. Are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert?
        - Part two great thanks for referencing us all to the text so everybody look take a look at your text right paragraph two right NASA send a small machine.
        - Thank you 
        - Okay yeah in the text . Chris.
        - Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay.
        - but read the question to me one more time.
        - And Farrah Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?
        - Ah, OK that's a great point so let's go back to the microscope So what does it say.
        - I can do it, um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question.
        - Rereads text or question without specific purpose or support
        - What I want you guys to do is to look at that reading, one more time 
        - so I want to go back to what Jazmin said so Jazmin can you read actually the first sentence of paragraph to read the whole sentence, where you found the answer okay.
        - But how about. First, we go back to the question itself. Oh, yes. Jazmin.
        - Let me see.
        - I know we had a question to start us off that was I don't know Can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this group.
        - Okay, so let's take a look at the text.
        - Not I sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us.
        - Chris, you mentioned that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. Can you take a look at the the title for me, can you read the title of the article for me?
        - Jazmin do you mind reading that first sentence out loud.
        - Farrah or Jazmin That was a great point, could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer.
        - Oh yeah yeah okay so
        - Great so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - Yes, sorry I think I drew your attention to the wrong part of that paragraph, will you read the i'm going to read it to you that way I don't have to keep telling you which sentence "moon water could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
        - The Lunar Orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - So the first thing that I want us to do we're going to look back at actually what the question is asking us.
        - Is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oliver saw your hand first. Let's go with you.
        - You were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if I would suggest you revisit the question one more time.
        - Okay that's Okay, if you guys have the texts in front of you, we can look where it says number two do you see where it says number two i'll read it for you, it says NASA.
        - sure. Okay, so, paragraph two, um, let's see.
        - Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Yeah. Okay. The question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, sure, sure, sure. Okay. Um, okay, we're still in number three. Yeah. Oh, cuz this is where my answer came from.
        - Chris. Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon.
        - On yeah I can do that okay.
        - yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what Luis said because I went to NASA actually, and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits.
        - So let's look at the question again. Luis we read it to me one more time.
        - Oh, I love to hear what you know about space right now I want to focus on the question that we had to ask, what was it exactly do you have the text in front of you. Maybe someone can read it from their book from their icon.
        - Yeah, ok. It says Okay, water on the moon is a desert.
        - So, but if we look on down in paragraph.
        - So we have NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - Jazmin, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph.
        - Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close. 
        - three, paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth, they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.
        - I want you to read closely about the paragraphs, the second paragraph, 
        - um well actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers.
        - Yeah, I'll read it. 
        - That's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, everyone looked back and paragraph two,
        - So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine. Now, Jazmin. Yes.
        - Okay, so let's read straight from the text. Let's go. Farrah.
        - Can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me, please. Farrah.
        - Yeah sure. These ice deposits are very small.
        - Let's look back, I'll give you guys about a minute or so individually. Let's look back individually.
        - Reach Every Reader:Okay, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Great. All right, who would like to read number two.
        - OK. Let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3. Did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three? And then we'll talk about those four answers.
        - So, um, when I read it, I read the thing where it talked about the microscope, because I thought microscope was a tool just like Jazmin.
        - Um, what do you think it does. According to paragraph two, what does it do, again, what's the second sentence say
        - I don't see anything.
        - Excellent and Oliver could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling.
        - I want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us, what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to Farrah.
        - Perfect summary. Thank you so much for summer for us but I loved your summary. And you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used, let's go back and look at paragraph one into
        - um can you read that part in the text out loud for me.
        - Teacher : NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one. Can you read the next sentence for me Oliver.
        - Um. 
        - Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read. You could look at the sentence. What do you see there?
        - Well, why would finding water on the moon useful.
        - yeah I would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five, is that right.
        - Which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me.
        - It says that it's really dry.
        - Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot
        - Okay, I'm going to continue reading number three. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth.
        - So can you guys look back at paragraph two?
        - Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways.
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - and take a couple of minutes to read it, while I connect with your fellow space enthusiasts classmates and maybe you can also kind of keep an ear open while you're reading and and get a sense of what your classmates got out of it so Jazmin what yes Jazmin.
        - Oh yeah, sure. Okay. Scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within
        - NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - NASA small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - So in part three, it says
        - Wow, I was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut. So I know all this stuff, you know.
        - Can you read what that question is.
        - Okay, yeah. Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits
        - So maybe um I wonder if Oliver could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy.
        - mm hmm that is a great question so if we look at the text that we read it says that the Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's all look back at our question. Let's look back at number one. Do you want to if you guys want to read this question for me.
        - Lunar Orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar
        - So that's correct. So now we're going to reflect on what Jazmin shared there. So I want everyone to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two. Anyone want to read out loud, the first, second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter.
        - So maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a class, we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that.
        - Can who can read that for sentence to me.
        - i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again. Oliver yeah, thank you.
        - That means the moon, is still dryer and it's a very fun for.
        - i'm wondering, could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for everybody.
        - Even I want you to go back to the text and reread pragraphs one and three.
        - Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Sure. Um, what scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - The discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but let's read the next step. So can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me.
        - paragraphs three and four specifically
        - let's go back to the question, can you maybe the first.
        - Yeah, I can do it.
        - And that they use equipment to search for things. So when you look back at your reading. Oliver, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay.
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look in the text. Okay. Do you, can you guys see the text.
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Okay, do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer?
        - Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be. Can anybody tell me
        - yeah and um Could you also please read, for us, the first sentence of Part two
        - Okay okay NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay. Oh, part three. You said the first sentence. Okay. It says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on Earth.
        - Yeah, maybe reread it once or twice, just to see, okay, 
        - Okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, no. I guess it's not
        - Right. So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, Farrah?
        - Yeah, great. Okay, now you can start to read the task now.
        - Alright, so I want everyone to focus in on the second sentence and we're going to look at it in paragraph two, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so.
        - Sure. So, Farrah, why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us.
        - So let's start by looking back at the question again.
        - It says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. So water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely.
        - Oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two, with me really quick, can you read that first sentence for me.
        - So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate
        - That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs.
        - That's a really good question. So the way that I would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text.
        - All right. Hi, everybody. So we, we just read the moon is a desert and I asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        -  so let's start from the beginning, so if you go back to the question I love to have you wide, so why don't you try reading the question again.
        - You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small.
        - That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you. So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now.
        - Each ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day.
        - It says rocket fuel.
        - But let's kind of read. Can everybody go back and read the number Paragraph to where it starts with NASA sent a small, can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph, please. 
        - Mm hmm. Yeah, okay, these ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.
        - So what machine was used to find the water
        - And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this 
        - So, reading back through and what Jazmin had just talked about with this small machine
        - So Would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different, at the end.
        - but can you actually read the question out loud, for me, can you read the question.
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely Farrah.
        - Sure. Okay. Number three
        - Up yeah so I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - These ice deposits for very small sounds. It says that one of the top 10 layers. Okay, good. That was for myself. Thank you guys and that they would contain water.
        - So Oliver can you read the question again that we're working to answer.
        - Yeah. What equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah. On what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound.
        - So let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me.
        - But if we go back in the text, and we just need to clarify.
        - Okay, so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - would be a valuable or very important resource, it could be useful in lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is...
        - Sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them. And then we found the water, but the water is microscopic. 
        - Um, I can read it.
        - So can someone read the question out loud to me.
        - So when I say go, you have one minute to review your three little paragraphs and then we'll come back together to talk okay go ahead.
        - Now, Oliver, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?
        - I don't, I don't see what you're seeing
        - I can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph.
        - Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
        - The second one is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Oh, you didn't know about the water and that's incredible well if you actually go back to the passage in the first paragraph.
        - Yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon.
        - To read aloud.
        - But what does the first sentence say?
        - One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me Chris.
        - Um, well, it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen. Oh, they use both for rocket fuel.
        - Um would anyone like to read the question, the first question for us.
        - Alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part, do you mind repeating the question for us?
        - It says NASA sent a machine called all Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter. These are still deposits are very small.
        - Farrah, do you want to read it for me.
        - so Jazmin, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?
        - Everybody should look at your paragraph.
        - The part of the paragraph. The article. The second part where waters valuable resource. It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways.
        - So let's look back at the text. So what is the question we're trying to answer.
        - NASA sent a small machine to the moon to investigate.
        - Yeah, I see, I see. In the last minute. So, would you mind Chris, would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class, please.
        - So why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time. Could someone read that out loud to me.
        - Farrah. Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer.
        - Yeah, I can do that. Definitely. Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - Well, then, what is the second paragraph, say,
        - Oh yeah you're absolutely right i've seen that line, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits.
        - Yeah. Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon.
        - Good. Awesome. So can some, Farrah or one of you, which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1?
        - "astronauts can breathe oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel. Rocket fuel can help spacecrafts to move," just like a gas helps cars.
        - Yeah. It says, That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth.
        - Farrah can you read the question for me.
        - Let's look back at the text.
        - I circled it and everything.
        - Does anybody want to go back and read over in paragraph 5?
        - So read that sentence again for me. And while you're reading it. I'm going to talk with Oliver
        - I forgot to put the discovering water part, but I did put the equipment in my answer.
        - Do me a favor, I want you to look at paragraph five,
        - So if we look back in the story.
        - Yeah. I'd like to read it. But also I wanted to say that I went to NASA and so I know that I use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff.
        - Uh huh. It says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - let's very quickly. I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time. I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me.
        - Yeah, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate 
        - I'm going to read that for all of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water 
        - and in our text when we look at our texts. Let's all look at our text.
        - The very first sentence.
        - Can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me?
        - Okay, the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater.
        - Um okay. Um second paragraph, and number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - Yeah, sure. OK, paragraph 3. That means the moon is still drier than the rest of-        - oh, sorry. OK. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yeah, so I see where you're looking. NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.
        - Okay, it says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
        - I want to look back at the question so Jazmin, would you go ahead and read the question for us.
        - Okay, so this this might work for you to this next suggestion, so what I might do is do a little bit of rereading.
        - Okay, so, but before we do that can Farrah. Will you read the question aloud to the group, please.
        - Okay, can you read the sentence at the word machine comes in Farrah.
        - Oh i'm so sorry I really I really want to keep going, but we have to go to lunch now.
        -  all right, can you read that to me please.
        - And I repeat it. I'm NASA to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits
        - um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.
        - Okay, I heard this one, and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel.
        - Oh, um,
        - Okay, um, the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - It did so, I want you to read read me the question out loud.
        - and then Chris, can you reread the part about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Right, so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great.
        - Okay, Oliver. I saw your hand first. Will you read. Question number one for us, please.
        - yeah Okay, right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so Luis wants to read the second question for us.
        - Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - And then in the second paragraph, right there. If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me.
        - And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have Luis read that sentence for us.
        - In their paper with me. It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - they they use the small machine, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Well, let's look at paragraph three reading
        - Okay. And then if you look in at then at the next
        - Or the South Pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small. 
        -  um yeah so I sent a microscope That was my answer um so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - um Okay, so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - I found my answer. Paragraph one
        - Yeah. I can read paragraph 2. 
        - Okay, and what else does it say about it.
        - yeah Okay, so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover.
        - yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay.
        - Yeah. Um, okay. The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface. will, in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day.
        - But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon. Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,
        - The moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's color craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
        - Yeah, okay. Um, let's see. So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest
        -  So if we look at paragraph two, I just want you. You can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud. Could you read the first sentence of paragraph to to me.
        - So now I'm going to read the next sentence.
        - Okay, and Oliver can you reread that first question?
        - how about Luis Would you go back and read paragraph two for us. Would you read it aloud place.
        - Is me Farrah. I see the last sentence kind of after Jazmin and Chris's. It says, having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things. So is that the right answer.
        - Sure. Okay. So it says, um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable.
        - Luis just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us.
        - I'm not sure.
        - So Chris, actually read the next sentence too.
        - [Reads text to herself quickly]. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - As a group, look back at paragraphs three and four. How's that sound.
        - Okay, well I do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five, so I'd like everybody to look at paragraph five,
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for us deposits in a large polar crater. These deposits are very small.
        - A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk. Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute 
        - But how about we look once again at the text you know.
        - Okay. Would you like Chris, would you like to read the second paragraph?
        - Oh yeah I can but I just wanted to say before I read anything that I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like everything there is to know about space.
        - Okay, let's let Chris, will you read number two.
        - Take a look specifically at paragraph two.
        - Yes. So, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, I'm water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.
        - Water could be useful in other ways. Water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.
        - Okay, so everybody look at your paper. Let's look at paragraph two. Jazmin, can you just read that for me again. What did you just just read it one more time for me.
        - Cuz my answer. I said, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water. Okay. And then in the paragraph number four. It says future astronauts could drink this water.
        - Luis Can you read the second sentence and paragraph two,
        - So paragraph two, says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - Luis, are we rereading, make sure you're reading our passage.
        - Okay, so let's look back to paragraph. Let's see. Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource. So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource.
        - Oh yeah Okay, it says, this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth.
        - So, let's see paragraph three. That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely.
        - Very first in its
        - And then in paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Perfect. Okay. So if you look at our original question. Let's go back and Decode that question.
        - yeah yeah and, since you and Farrah you guys are agreeing each other, can I have Farrah read the third paragraph.
        - Can you read the discussion question for us. Again, Luis.
        - looks like it's looking for deposit.
        - I'm sure. Okay, this loan or what, oh well land damone South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - Look at paragraph five,
        - Okay, you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah Farrah would you like to just read the text for us again 
        - Okay, okay, but didn't I--
        - Okay Okay, so I can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it Farrah.
        - What does it say Jazmin?
        - Um, yeah, I can read it. Okay, so, um,
        - We can read super fast. So we're done.
        - Yeah, out loud.
        - So i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you guys can let me know if you're done before that.
        - Okay, good. So I want you to go back and I'd like you to look at paragraph number five.
        - Alright, so the main question I wanted to help you guys answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question.
        - but now Farrah can you give it another try, can you read, can we can you read, part two of the decks.
        - Alright perfect so i'll give you guys a second, if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read 
        - Let's see. NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Obriter to investigate.
        - but I want to reread it again I want to show you a sentence, and I think it's a.
        - Let me point you in the right direction. Okay.
        - Um, can you read the next two sentences for me.
        - Oh yeah. Yes. Sorry. Okay.
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater.
        - Yeah, sure. I'll read it. Um, me Luis, I'll read it but but I do want to say, I don't think I'm supposed to be in this group, cuz I already know a lot about space.
        - So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?
        - excuse me, I have my hand up.
        - Yeah, sure.
        - yeah I do!
        - Would you be able to read that last sentence for us, then, as a group.
        - I want you to like for everybody else go back and reread because in the small, the first paragraph, is where you got that from.
        - Okay, one word or can be useful and other ways. Okay, um, water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen. And I swear. I swear I'm
        - So in the text, I think it was in
        - So before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them, I want you guys to reread and look at the paragraph four, five and six in your reading once you guys are done, we can look at, we can keep going with this lesson.
        - Let's look at number two, the sentence starts with NASA
        - So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now. Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two. Actually let's start with just paragraph two.
        - Okay. Can you, can everyone look back at number three on your document. So let's see. Farrah, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence.
        - Yeah, okay. Um, is there convincing evidence that
        - Okay, I'll do that.
        - So why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - You know what Farrah that's a great point can we all look at our text and look at the second paragraph.
        - Hi, Jazmin, I saw your hand first. Let's go.
        - can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking Chris.
        - Alright, Farrah read that, the number one.
        - Jazmin. Can I get you to read the question.
        - I want you to go back and look at the passage. It says, water is a valuable resource. I want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage.
        - Wow, like, okay, so they use, like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like, you know, all the stuff that astronauts have to use right.
        - So tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um yeah okay so
        - To look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work. So it says the moon.
        - The beginning of paragraph two, okay. So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater. Okay.
        - Oh, alright. Can you read that whole sentence to me, starting from the beginning.
        - yeah it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Can you read the second sentence out loud to me.
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Alright, Jazmin. Can I get you to read number three.
        - Farrah, can you read?
        - um it says okay circle circle, the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question.
        - Okay, um, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the Moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one--
        - yeah yeah Okay, I guess, I can do that. 
        - The whole thing a paragraph two,
        - So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence.
        - But so i'm curious if we can look through the text again.
        - Can you read it out loud for me.
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water.
        - Can someone read reread paragraph two, for me, where it begins with NASA send a small machine, who can read that for me.
        - Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater
        - Well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can I get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context.
        - Can I get you to do it, Oliver.
        - Why don't we all take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me.
        - Let me see. OK. I see.
        - Yes. Absolutely. Go ahead, Farrah. Paragraph 1.
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic
- intent: r120.4
  examples: |
        - Um, so I was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon.
        - Um, okay. So I was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready.
        - Water is valuable. We've got to drink it all the time. So yeah, based on the article, I would say, yeah, water on the moon is valuable.
        - yeah I definitely want to go soon, so what pieces of equipment, did you talk about in your answer Chris?
        - While you're thinking, I'm going to answer, guys. My question, what did you need Jazmin, what was your question?
        - Oh, it wasn't a question. It's just that I found the rest of the sentence.
        - How about you, Chris? All right.
        - so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon?
        - Luis How are you doing? because I know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well.
        - All right, so, Farrah. Do you want to share first?
        - I'll start. So I said that  In terms of what it meant it. Scientists us to discover water.
        - awesome Farrah go ahead.
        - Okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths, where it was like, not for a long time because it said, making this plan will take a lot of time and money.
        - All right, so what did we decide was the most important word in that question? Somebody raise your hand.
        - yeah I said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - yeah i'm I circled the same as Farrah.
        - Okay and Farrah, isn't that what you mentioned? You'd need a scientific tool called a what?
        - Sounds good. Okay, you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close.
        - All right. Um, and then Oliver. Did you get the chance to revise yours?
        - Why don't we go around the table so Farrah, you can start and then it will be Oliveron Chris and so on.
        - Jazmin, maybe?
        - Jazmin, do you have a question?
        - Okay, well, I put the Lunar orbiter and then I added that to what I said about the microscope So then, I have two names of equipment and I have looking really closely, which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right?
        - Luis I want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon. do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon?
        - Let's start with Farrah, would you mind reading your answer to me?
        - A lunar orbiter. Farrah kind of touched on that in her answer.
        - yeah. so I said water can be split up into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Farrah and Oliver, how's it going as far as you're looking through the text?
        - Well, I said that, um, you know, that they could use. Um, maybe that's uh
        - I said they could drink it.
        - I'm ready, I'm ready to go.
        - Oh, so I think it's the microscope. 
        - Um, yeah, yeah, I can talk about my answer. Um, so my answer is I'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay, Oliver. Can you tell me what your answer was?
        - Chris, what about you?
        - yeah yes Chris, you want to add to that?
        - Thank you for that understanding today. so Chris, I'd like to hear your response.
        - Okay, Oliver. Can you tell me?
        - Farrah. Can you tell me what you what you thought?
        - Miss Jazmin, what do you think
        - so Farrah can you remind me of your answer yes Luis.
        - Luis Let's uh, let's start with you for a second. So for equipment from the passage. The moon is a desert.
        - Yeah um I circled the last sentence. It's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three
        - When you have an example, raise your hand. Luis What's your example.
        - Farrah. What did you say
        - Alright so Farrah. Can you remind me of your answer.
        - Any ideas about how they might detect water on, from the orbiter?
        - Hmm, okay. Now that I've seen a picture of it. Um, I think that, let's see, how would they detect the water. Um, I feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it. And if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it.
        - Thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact I didn't know that does anyone else, want to try working through their response or strengthening it.
        - Okay, so, can you tell me.
        - Luis. Go ahead.
        - Alright, so Jazmin now it's your turn, can you remind me what your answer was for the question number one.
        - Yeah, I was this, I said yes.
        - yeah okay so um I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen.
        - If ice. It was ice.
        - Was I was just asking.
        - I do have a question. Yes. So I'm not sure I agree with Jazmin, because what I'm thinking is, if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope, then how can you find it if you can't even see it.
        - Um, yeah, like there's a few things that I should are that I've learned from like I learned that, like, Well, like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that.
        - yeah sure I said i'm that you'd need, let me look, I think I say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover Oliver why don't we hear from you first.
        - So who would like to share what their response was to that question, Jazmin.
        - Okay awesome um who would like to share what they found would anyone like to go first.
        - Good. How about you, Chris.
        - Okay Well, this is so, I changed my answer so first I said the microscope like Farrah did, but now now, I think, maybe they were just saying that it's really small so.
        - Can we start with your answer. Luis
        - Well he's reading that. What was your answer.
        - hi so Luis, can you tell me a little bit about your answer.
        - So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question.
        - So let's see Chris what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So with that in mind, who can tell me what are the two tools that we need
        - Um, yeah. Well, it's kind of more of like a thought, I guess. I think I got this all figured out. So I think I'm all good. 
        - Oh perfect what's your answer okay.
        - Well Would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like?
        - I said that all scientists know I said, you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely.
        - Thank you. Hi, Jazmin. You have a question for me.
        - Yeah, okay. I said, ah, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh, could you Luis could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in Part two
        - I guess like I went to NASA. And so I i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit, and I guess I'm wondering, like why that wasn't right.
        - I said yes. And I said, the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water.
        - Right. Luis What's another use
        - Farrah, do you have anything you want to add
        - Chris. Would you remind me what you were saying, just so we can catch back up.
        - So Oliver, you told me you circled the same answer as Farrah. Can you remind me which part you and Farrah circled again?
        - Farrah  go for it 
        - Excuse me, teacher, I shouldn't be. Ms. Great. I already know all about space.
        - All right, well, you do that Deb Farrah and Luis Do you have a question.
        - So, okay, be what I was looking at
        - Sure. My answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yeah, I said that NASA found a small machine. And that's the same thing. Farrah just said.
        - Luis Luis What did you want to ask first,
        - What do you have any other suggestions.
        - So finally miss Farrah. Do you want to share your revised answer
        - yeah absolutely so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you and I in particular, I really wanted to thank you for working with us.
        - Yes, Farrah go ahead and say it.
        - So who thinks they can answer that question now what evidence, would you circle.
        - My example as water can be broken down into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Um, Farrah what was your answer to this one.
        - So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you
        - Oliver have a different tool that he found
        -  Okay, well, I circled two is that okay.
        - I know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay.
        - Sure.
        - Ah, I said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks.
        - Oh. Chris, did you discuss your observation with Jazmin do you guys have an answer?
        - So does anyone. Does anyone want to volunteer in a response to that question. I have any ideas about that.
        - What's your idea, Chris?
        - OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - You just said it does know what was your answer.
        - Alright, so we're Chris, do your best. Let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you. Okay, Farrah. What was your answer?
        - Oliver. I did see that you put you answered the same as Farrah. So in your words. Can you tell me how you would answer that question.
        - Okay, well, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        -  Oliver would you like to share?
        - Jazmin what was your answer to that question.
        - Luis What was your answer to that question.
        -  okay.
        - Yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter. Maybe they use a microscope. Who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks. 
        - All right, can you just remind me of your answer.
        - Well I can share. 
        - All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you.
        - Jazmin, do you remember the name
        - Yeah, okay. So I said, water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore.
        - and can you go ahead and remind me, what did you respond.
        - Well, I was saying that the scientists would have to use like I'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that I already know before like ever doing the reading.
        - Farrah. Can your group. Tell me what you What your reflection was
        - Oliver
        - Okay, go ahead Oliver.
        - What did you say in your your response.
        - So let's see what Chris has to say.
        - How did you answer the question again?
        - Oliver.
        - um yeah well, I suppose same thing as Farrah.
        - And Farrah. Were you getting the same things as Oliver since you're working together.
        - Go ahead. 
        - So I said, like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need, like, all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space.
        -  and so Chris did that help you answer the question, what was your answer.
        - Well, let me just review, do you want to share something
        - one more word that someone wrote down for discover anyone have another idea here.
        - And then, when you guys are done, I would love for Chris, I want you to tell us a little bit about what you found in the fourth paragraph that made you think that water having water on the moon can be beneficial or valuable and then
        - Chris? 
        - Oliver, you have a question.
        - Awesome, great Jazmin. So I first want to start with Farrah. Farrah Could you read, you me your answer
        - Okay, so I think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon, and they used to think. There wasn't any but now they know because they found it.
        - Does someone to have a response, they might want to share with the group.
        - Alright, so now Oliver, can you tell me what you answered what you said.
        - Well, why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote. Alright, sounds like a plan?
        - Share with us your answer.
        - Ya so I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine.
        - Would anyone like to share
        - So how about Jazmin, could you actually read what you wrote?
        - So who wants. Why don't we start with Farrah. Could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer.
        - Go ahead.
        - Yeah Oliver give it a try.
        - Anybody want to--
        - All right, Farrah, and what was your answer to the discussion question.
        -  Chris.
        - No, I was done. 
        - So can you give me something different?
        - Okay. I think the most important word is equipment.
        - but who would like to raise their hand and answer is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - yeah so basically what I said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close.
        - yeah so now i'm a little confused because I guess well, I thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe Jazmin is correct, so is she right or am I right.
        - You want to say something about the text Luis?
        - So Oliver what do you have
        - awesome so you corrected your answer so we'll take you as a volunteer to go first.
        - You're right, Farrah. So what did you say for your answer?
        - What did you circle, Luis.
        - Um, let me see. But I did want you to. I just want to remind you, my dad is an astronaut.
        - and Oliver, could you please tell us?
        - Does anybody have any thoughts?
        - So we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon. So Farrah can you remind me what your answer was? what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Absolutely. Very good, thank you. And so what was your response to this.
        - so I said microscope, but I'm not quite sure. Like why is my answer wrong.
        - Oh, this actually does anyone want to start and share their opinion again allowed
        - Well I, I wanted. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        -  Chris, would you be able to share with us, which you were able to locate.
        - Okay, so what's your answer?
        - Okay, so can you tell me your answer again.
        - What was your answer. Sorry.
        - so Chris, could you repeat your answer for us, please.
        - Okay, do you want to go first.
        - Okay, what did you figure out.
        - yeah yeah. Okay, so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so Farrah was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and I think that Farrah's right.
        - Okay, so now let's look at your statement.
        - So what was your answer to the question, what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Luis What did you circle.
        - Wonderful. Chris?
        - Okay, mine has the equipment, but not the second part.
        - Okay well um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Oh yeah, um, well actually, at the end, maybe I'm thinking a little differently um like, I was thinking, so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water, is that the idea?
        - Luis do you read something different or similar?
        - What was your answer, Jazmin?
        - um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um yeah we both circled the microscope.
        - All right, would anyone like to share What were they circled.
        -  Okay, you want me to say it now.
        - Great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled.
        - um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share.
        - So Luis Can you remind you what was your answer for this question.
        - Can I ask a quick question?
        - would like to go and answer them okay so.
        - Well i'm i'm thinking that so actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So looking over your responses. And it seems like everyone has read the article. Yes. You had a question.
        - Okay. So real quick, back to the last question, Farrah, can you repeat the answer in that you came up with for this?
        - Well, I was just, I was thinking that you know if I'm, if, if, if the astronauts got, like, you know, thirsty or something, then they could just like drill a hole in the moon, maybe, and then they could drink the water like that maybe.
        - What equipment or do you see mentioned in there.
        - Before the issue, the response I was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because I went to NASA into I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - um so I I told Chris, but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it, because it says microscopic.
        - And then Farrah, can you explain your answer.
        - Chris. What do you think about the reading. Was it informative for you?
        - Yes, well, I said NASA send a small machine.
        - Can you tell me what your answer is too is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it.
        - yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - Okay, I'm gonna while you look, I'm going to go to Jazmin and look at Jazmin's answer so Jazmin. Can you repeat your answer for me, please.
        - Oliver, What did you come up with.
        - So could you tell me a piece of equipment that they used?
        - Okay somebody else tell me what word they thought was really important in that question to kind of give us a clue to what the answer should be. 
        - Okay, so let's look at Oliver. 
        - Okay, Farrah. And so, do you mind to share with us what your response was,
        - Um, well, I was just gonna say that I kind of know like all about space. I don't think I need to be in this group.
        - Oh no, but we were just talking about the equipment. And so that made me think of that. And I thought, probably, they would have to use those things too. Don't you think
        - Um, so basically what I was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine.
        - Yes, and I said NASA sent a small machine.
        - Okay, so I said yes, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - I said that NASA send a small machine.
        - Farrah, would you like to go first.
        - yeah Farrah what would you like to add?
        - yeah I agree, I do think that they use the microscope to look closely at the water but Jazmin do you want to share your answer.
        - Yes. Luis Did you have a question?
        - Jazmin, what did you put
        - First, let's hear, Oliver. What's your response.
        - Oh yeah do you want to share with the group.
        - Okay, well, I said that, yes, I sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Um, to basically we. Is it the answer to the question, or like, why are you
        -  What else, Luis.
        - Yeah. All right. So Luis since you said you know a lot about space, can you answer the question for us what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon from our water on the moon text. Do you remember what the equipment they used
        -  So Chris, what do you think.
        - Okay, so how about somebody else in your group tell me what you got to the final answer either Chris and Jazmin.
        - So, um, I want to know from you all. Maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading. So I'd like to start with Farrah. Can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading.
        - So, Svaannah have you found anything yet about an any other equipment?
        - Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?
        - so, can you guys raise your hand to someone to answer my question. what color is my sweater?
        - Which is what? Like-
        - What was your answer. Can you tell me again.
        - I would use the small machine that NASA sent, and I would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water.
        - No problem. So let's all share what we had for our responses.Who would like to start?
        - i'm i'm okay at work really well but um I just I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now.
        - Awesome. So, um, let's see, Farrah. Were you the one that talked about
        - Jazmin, you haven't spoken yet. What do you believe they may have sent to the moon.
        -  so Farrah and Oliver did you find or did you revise your answers yet.
        - I don't understand why is my answer is wrong.
        - All right, Dave do you have a question.
        - let's move on, so um Chris, could you please read your response out loud.
        - yeah okay so uhm Jazmin pointed out that it says, actually, that the ice deposits are really small so, even though I was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water, it sounds like it's not really like that.
        - The Lunar Orbiter?
        - Okay, I heard you telling Jazmin and Chris and Farrah that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that, and so I think I can go back to my desk.
        - Okay, so we changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer. What else can we add into our answer to make make it a little bit more credible?
        - Did anybody get it does anybody know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this, Jazmin.
        - Well yeah I had a completely different answer than them. I said let me look at what I wrote down. 
        - Um, so my answer was basically that I had I you know I circled the same thing as as Farrah. And I think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover. 
        - So okay, so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen.
        - What did you say Jazmin.
        - Oh yeah. Okay, so can you read me your answer. Again, sometimes it's hard to keep up with so many. I can't see him.
        - Could you tell me what you think.
        - Teacher : Oliver, Jazmin, Luis, Farrah. Did you hear anything.
        - Okay, well, I I had a circle, the same thing I Farrah because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um.
        - um well, so I said the same thing as Farrah about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story.
        - NASA sent a small machine.
        - i'm sorry, when you say for hydrogen again, while.
        - So I think we have one more person we haven't heard from yet, would you like to go ahead.
        - So, Oliver and Farrah. What did you find when you were reading
        - yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - So, you said that you circle, the same answer so vana what answer was that.
        - Well, I was just looking at the clock and I i see about it's time for us to go to lunch. So I just wanted to let you know before we call
        - yeah Okay, so I said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Can someone raise their hand and let me know what it was?
        - Yeah. OK, so my answer was basically
        - So today Chris, could you tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon, could you read your answer to me?
        - yeah Okay, I can go.
        - Said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, so actually I guess it was really about looking like discover
        - Luis can you tell me what your answer was to the question.
        - Well i'm i'm a little confused because I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay, all right so Farrah i'm gonna start with you so in remind me of what your answer was.
        - Chris. How about you, why you read. Read your story. What did you find
        - Um, yeah. So I guess I was wondering, like, I think I know the words, but I was wondering about like discover
        - All right, do you have anything else you want to add?
        - yeah so I said i'm like Farrah I said no, because it's not ready yet.
        - and so you all had answers that i'd like to draw on, and I think I want to start with Jazmin Jazmin, can you tell us what you said for this first question.
        - So can you read your response. One more time Farrah a please
        - so Farrah. Let's look back to your answer you answered.
        - Farrah let's start with you.
        - Um, okay, well i i had the same answer as Farrah cuz I I said the thing, the same thing about how they went um, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz
        - Now Chris. Can you tell me what your answer was, again,
        - Yeah, so I was just say, um, let's see, I think it was talking about like the before lunch. I was talking about like craters. Well, so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon, and that that was like you know what I mean, like, they found all this water.
        - Oh my circle two words right
        - Um, yeah. So basically what I said was, um, Let's see, what did I say I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Yes Farrah/
        - So my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh, my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Hmm what equipment, ok we had equipment, did scientists use to discover water well I guess really the only good word left is moon.
        - Yes. Okay, and Jazmin, would you like to read us your answer.
        - ym yeah I can try and put this all together. Okay, so the astronauts went to the moon.
        - um okay so basically what I said okay so initially what I had said was that I circled the same as Farrah Farrah.
        - Good job. All right, Chris, your turn.
        - Jazmin, what do you think
        - Oliver what are you going to circle.
        - So Can somebody look and try to see where a good evidence would be to add into our answer.
        - Yeah, please go ahead
        - So we asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are all of your answers.
        -  Jazmin, what do you think.
        - Um, I found mine in paragraph one.
        - Look like we're ready. Who would like to share Your takeaways.
        - yeah Jazmin do you have something to add.
        - Okay Luis I'll work with you, independently, Luis, what was your answer to the question.
        - So we're still talking about the Lunar orbiter does anybody have any thoughts that we didn't bring up before Luis.
        -  All right. Luis You said you knew a lot about science. Was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you.
        - Is from the other group wants to share which word. Did you discuss
        - Yeah, okay. So I said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, let me hear it.
        - Farrah, let's start with you. What word. Did you circle in your question.
        - Okay Oliver and Farrah sorry, you know both both kind of speaking same time Oliver let's doyou first and then Farrah
        - Yeah, okay I think so, when we were rereading. I saw that in paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - So i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were.
        - yeah I said NASA send a small machine.
        - Hi, Jazmin. Thank you for raising your hand, would you like to share something interesting about the reading.
        - Farrah, what's something that you learn new from your partners.
        - Chris?
        - What is it Luis
        - go ahead Farrah, what were you going to say?
        - Um, yeah. So, um, I just wanted to say that, like, I don't think I need to be in this group because I already know. Like all about space.
        - So I said that you could wait. Okay, um, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, which is a big deal.
        - Can I go first.
        - Oliver you had a question you had answer also
        - Yes. Does anyone else. Yes, Chris, what did you find?
        - Okay um how about Oliver, what did what was your answer.
        - yeah all right okay perfect so um let's let's go around does someone want to tell me what words or phrases they circled when looking at this question yeah Farrah.
        - I circled the same thing, small machine
        - Okay um Okay, so I think i'll say.
        - So I want some people to share what equipment they circled.
        - Oliver, you can go first. 
        - Um, okay. Yes. So, so I looked, I looked, because I was also I was listening to what you are seeing a Jazmin.
        - I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing.
        - And Jazmin, what was, what was your answer to that question.
        - Ice is frozen water.
        - What did you have.
        - All right, i'll be right here all right Oliver and Farrah, how is it going what have you guys been discussing.
        - says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk, but we can meet them. Um, my answer was that NASA send to small machine.
        -  can I have somebody else share their answer please.
        - Oh. Yes. So basically, my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Chris What was your thinking for this question.
        - Okay Luis What do you think
        - So I would change my answer what I would say, as I would say, like um, so I said initially scientists craters on the water.
        - I'm sorry. Say that one more time.
        - Luis I know you do right? 
        - Since we first answered the question. So anyone have any new ideas, Chris. What do you think
        - I know that you all have burning answer an average if I to go over with you are Luis Do you have a question.
        - Um, so I circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason, but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits
        - Okay, so I'm
        - you're welcome welcome Oliver we haven't heard from you, I see um.
        - Even you can go ahead and start.
        - It's called a lunar orbiter
        - Um, what, what did you correct it to what did you write down again.
        - And you know okay so up I said scientists found critters full of water on the moon.
        - I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - I said before, a conversation I said NASA send a small machine, but now I see that.
        - Yes, Chris. Do you have something to add?
        - On y'all because I was just thinking that because I went to NASA. And I just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, and that wasn't in the reading.
        - can you remind me, Jazmin, what was your answer to this question.
        - awesome um okay so Luis I know you are unsure about being in this group can we look at your response.
        - Luis what did you think?
        - Okay, so what was your response Luis?
        - Great and Luis.
        - awesome are why don't we move on to Chris Chris, would you like to read out loud your answer.
        - Well, I wanted to add on it's really about the Lunar orbiter but it's that on I went to NASA actually so I know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay cool and Chris go ahead.
        - So let's talk about it. I'm, I have a question for you. Leave the one to say something about it. 
        - yeah I said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon.
        - hmm yeah could you read your answer for me.
        - Oliver. How is your answer.
        - Um, well, I found the same thing. Not even was saying, but they have also have a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter. Um, but I thought one is talking about. I spend only in paragraph one paragraph three, or they're really talking about the water
        - i'm the same thing that they found that the Lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, you can share
        - That the water could be used for Farrah, do you have anything else to add,
        - So my answer was, I said no because it's not ready yet.
        - Yeah okay, I'm Chris. I think the most important word is water.
        - So basically we said like, what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say, okay, people would use.
        - I say.
        - Um, yeah. So we were reading water on the moon. And I just want to remind you, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Chris, what did you underline
        - Okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope.
        - I'm glad you haven't figured out, Luis. So can you remind the class of your answer.
        - Do you want to talk about your answer. Luis
        - Oh well, I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Okay, because I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Chris do you know wat a crater is?
        - Does anybody else have any ideas about what other types of equipment scientists use the NASA scientists use?
        - yeah okay um so I wrote down that all.
        - Jazmin refresh my memory. What was your answer.
        - Alright, what anyone else, like okay okay good yeah would anyone else, like to share.
        - Oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we 
        - Now, Oliver, could you talk to us about your answer?
        - yeah yeah before we do that, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Okay, so what is
        - Oliver, go ahead. 
        - Okay. Um, so I thought the microscope. IT WAS THE RIGHT ANSWER. AND NOW. Well, now I know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer, but I don't really know how I would have known that I'm without without Jazmin telling us
        - Well, I mean, it was this-        - I think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does, and it's looking at the water. So I don't think there is another answer.
        - Yeah, I can share
        - Great. And so what is the answer that you've come up with now.
        - And then Luis What did you say for your answer.
        - And what was your response. What did you put
        - Yeah, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay, it was, um, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter was microscopic.
        - What I said was that scientists is used a small machine.
        - Great. Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer. Jazmin.
        - Well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - did anybody find another piece of equipment or that they said in their answer.
        - Oh, okay. Well, I want to know if my new answers. Okay, so my new answer is the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic
        - Um, yeah. So I would say, water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships.
        - What about you, Oliver, and Luis Do you feel like you need to reread or what did you talk about in small group.
        - Oh yeah well, I was just gonna say that about the Lunar orbiter so What it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon.
        - I circled equipment and water.
        - And I will go it's Jazmin.
        - What are you thinking for number two.
        - Um yeah i guess i well i went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
        - Yeah, so, um, we have to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us.
        - Who would like to tell me what word they circled
        - Yeah, so I know you could drink it. Well, it doesn't sound like there's a lot
        - Right. Cool. Thank you. Luis I'll need your help. And so can you guys show me your responses to the first question.
        - Well, so here's the thing, like I kind of thought that, like, um, well I've been to NASA with my dad and like we really
        - Oh wow okay perfect so you guys are all familiar with that scientific tool, thank you for your answer Farrah let's see who would like to read the response next do we have any volunteers yeah perfect go ahead Jazmin.
        - um yeah I don't understand why why my answers wrong.
        - Yes. So do you think water could be useful.
        - Yes, Chris. Go ahead.
        - Um, so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Farrah Would you mind sharing with us what your response was.
        - um well i've just been kind of listening to what everybody else was saying um so I haven't changed mine yet um.
        - When you have that tool identified or that piece of equipment. Go ahead and raise your hand.
        - So i'm going to ask you to look at i'm going to have you told me your answer, 
        - and see what I said was asking I say yes, that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated.
        - And let's just see what you guys got Farrah. Did you find one.
        - I did and I already corrected my answer too.
        - Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.
        - Farrah, can you tell me what you responded to that question
        - Number two, which is, which one do you mean number
        - Um, so basically I thought that. Okay, so my answer is also know and that I guess I feel a little different from Oliver is like, it wouldn't be useful for a long time.
        - i'm still kind of confused.
        - All right, and Farrah how about you, what was your answer?
        - Yes. Luis
        - Okay, do you want to share with us what you thought is water a valuable resource?
        - Yes, Chris.
        - yeah I am so my answer, I said well if kind of like Kara since actually cuz I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Yeah, so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water.
        - Will you like to do that. Luis
        - So what was your answer the question.
        - That is right. Now, Chris, would you like to share your answer?
        - When you confused on Jazmin?
        - Okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits.
        - Great, great job Luis. Um Farrah I wanted to touch base with you um again, I asked for your initial response um but can you please tell me what your revised response was?
        - Oliver can you share what you how you respond to that question.
        - Okay guys, so let's go ahead and review your answers. Yes. Luis
        - Oh, I couldn't figure out what was wrong because I thought the microscope was right.
        - um not to put you on the spot Chris, but since we are a small group I think you just be comfortable maybe you sharing with us.
        - awesome okay um so looking at the responses um does anyone, and just raise your hand, but does anyone would anyone like to share their response with us.
        - Jazmin do you want to share your sentence with me really quick oh Chris yes Chris well.
        - What do you think, Farrah? What was your answer on that? Do you remember?
        - just to ask um Farrah What was your revised answer.
        - Okay. Well, I think the key word as equipment, because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question.
        -  Okay yeah I circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Any thoughts about that?
        - um yeah well, I would just say i'm actually I circled the same as Farrah. 
        - You're not sure. Okay, we'll keep looking Chris, what, what can I help you with, what do you think you know the answer.
        - Oh, yeah. So I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.
        -  who would like to discuss their answer first
        - Jimmy. Do you want to repeat that for me what your response was to the question.
        - um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - yeah so I said.
        - Alright, Jazmin, I see your hand. What did you find?
        - Oliver, go ahead and love that smile. Go ahead.
        - How about you, Oliver.
        - Oliver. Thanks for raising your hands there.
        - You guys have any ideas from the reading that you want to share with the class.
        - Well, I mean OK, so now, I know that there's like.
        - awesome okay Chris, what did you talk about.
        - Oliver. What do you think
        - Okay, so Luis, can you tell me like what your answers.
        - yeah um.
        - Well, I said that the key word was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon.
        - takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft. Who mentioned this in their response, could you raise your hand?
        - Yes, Luis?
        - Yeah So could you tell me your answer again?
        - Um, OK. So my answer was no, you know, I'm because I don't think it's ready yet.
        - Excellent thanks Farrah and Jazmin Would you mind sharing, can you share what you circled.
        - Okay Luis What did you create your answer to?
        - What did everyone else write.
        - Farrah, what do you think?
        - yeah oh so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - so Chris. Can you share your answer again.
        - yeah So if I was going to if we were going to completely start over, and I was going to ask you guys what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, what would you guys tell me.
        - Okay, I'm sorry, Chris, what did you want to add to that.
        - Thank you. Jazmin, what were you gonna say was the most important part of the question.
        - Okay, so what else, what did what did you say, for how the scientists found the water.
        - Excellent Chris why don't you start us off, how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit.
        -  All right, miss some Vana. Have you figured out
        - Um, that they use the microscope to look closely at the water
        - Chris. What's the main idea of this text.
        - Could anyone answer that.
        - What Was your right answer was? Oliver
        - . And I think that's something that we could all use. So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you guys a question again. So Chris go ahead. 
        - Was it interesting for you?
        - yeah So what did you said, your answer was what can you tell me again.
        - Okay. So your answer was, will you refresh my memory and tell me what your answer was?
        - yeah well I think we did, but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer. Because I was sort of thinking, how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah I mean, I guess, I guess they use that small machine, but I still think that microscope is the right answer.
        - Oliver I want to or Chris, you had your hand raised also can, can you tell me what you were thinking?
        - anybody can raise their hand or shout out.
        -  so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question.
        - Okay. Um, what other questions do you have Chris.
        - Yeah, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Perfect who wants to share their answer first.
        - Okay, so tell me what you got.
        - All right, let's see, Jazmin, you have your hand up.
        - All right, anybody wants to share that. What does that mean yes Farrah?
        - So I heard, I read on Facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff.
        - What do you think about the article Oliver?
        - I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - What do you think, Luis?
        - yeah I think the microscope was the equipment they used.
        - Do you remember put for that?
        - I was just when.
        - Would anyone else, like to share well Luis goes back to read the article.
        - would anyone else, like to share.
        - Is a kind of the process of what you did to correct your answer Okay, so why don't we start with Luis. Luis so, can you tell me the difference between your original answer and your second answer.
        - yeah Farrah let's start with you, thank you for volunteering.
        -  there's another tool that they used. Did anyone mentioned that tool in their answer would like to share?
        - So, Oliver agrees Farrah agrees. Good. Luis Can you share what you were gonna share earlier, thank you for waiting.
        - I guess I don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for.
        - Yeah, so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.
        - Jazmin?
        - No, I'm ready to answer.
        - Excuse me teacher i'm still confused.
        - Well, I just, I mean, I do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water. So that seems to be convincing the have water.
        - Okay, so I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water
        - Yeah, well,
        - On. So I said, water because my answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and the whole story is about water.
        - Chris, what did you underline or circle.
        - Chris did you find the answer.
        - I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. Can you repeat that?
        - Hmm okay let's see, I wrote, Yes, I astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water.
        - Um, well, I was gonna say that. I went to NASA. So like with my dad. And so, I noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks, but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut. Is that right.
        - Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea. Chris was that you
        - Okay, I also kind of like Luis I definitely feel like I knocked it out the park this time because
        - Okay, so what did you your. And what did you want to add to that. Chris?
        - Well, so um so in there, it talks about that lunar orbiter but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Alright, Luis. Did you find where
        - Oliver. What would you like to add to that.
        - Chris, what do you think.
        - anyone else have responses yeah Farrah. 
        - So, Farrah. I'm going to call on you first. So what did you say when you answer this question.
        - Yeah, I thought it was a small machine.
        - um that they found craters for water on the moon.
        - Well, I mean, I had that same as Farrah, because I circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and I I circled the last sentence. Do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Great now let's give Oliver the opportunity to answer my question.
        - Great Thank you and you Oliver?
        - yeah you yep do you want to share with you wrote.
        - um yeah, I guess, for me, I, so I read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon, maybe by 2024 That was the goal, and I was wondering like.
        - Luis I know you had eaten and sorry I know you had some expertise, would you like to share.
        - and I want us to move on to the second question, and before we do that can Somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question.
        - Okay, well, um, before we have said down microscope, and I think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right. But there was one other tool. And that was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - I circled ah microscope.
        - Oh, they can ask you this.
        - Farrah, can you tell me what your answer was again.
        - let's hear what you guys have been talking about.
        - So we were talking about the different equipment and Chris and Jazmin were rereading the article so Chris and Jazmin, would you like to share with the group any of the equipment that you circled from the reading.
        - Me, My family. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. Um, but I did want to say thank you so much for
        - Scientists used a small machine to discover the water and I found the answer in paragraph two,
        - yeah I said scientists sent a small machine out NASA sent a small machine.
        - Chris  what do you have to add?
        - so Chris. Can you tell me what your response was,
        - yeah well just listening to what you said to Luis I see how all the cool stuff at NASA it helps the scientists, but it does it do the finding of the water.
        - yeah Okay, I said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So so Luis what are you what's what you have in your mind, then.
        - Do you have something for me. Yeah.
        - Yeah. Um, so this is
        -  alright, so we have had Farrah and Jazmin share their answers, so far, and we have Luis Chris and they've left with either one of you like to volunteer to go next.
        - yeah Okay, well, I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon.
        - Jazmin, I would like to hear from you.
        - Well, first, I was wondering, is my new answer okay.
        - Jazmin do you want to say some things I know you add years before.
        - Okay, Farrah, you know, what did you underline or circle.
        - What do you think Farrah do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts.
        - Jazmin, what did you circle?
        - i'm moving on her from Farrah What did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet.
        - So who wants to share their answer first?
        - Okay, but I also just want to say.
        - Yes, well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt, though.
        - Well, I don't really know very much about like
        - yeah okay, So um I said
        - Um, yeah. So I just unfortunately we have to go to lunch. But before we went to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us.
        - Would anyone else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready.
        - I do have a question. So, um, here's what I was thinking. Um, I know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space. I don't really think I need any help. I don't think I should be in this group.
        - Okay, so I said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like, for a long time.
        - Well, I had read the same thing that Farrah was talking about in the last paragraph. 
        - Okay, Chris. Go ahead.
        - yeah and then I also noticed that Oliver and Farrah you guys took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because I, I think you guys used a different word, maybe Farrah do you mind telling us what you mentioned, for your answer.
        - Yeah, actually, maybe I can help Chris, because my word that I picked was discover
        - Water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - yeah excuse me i'm Okay, I think I got this all figured out so i'm all good.
        - Okay, Jazmin. Let's look at your answer that you gave. Yes, Luis?
        - Really, what did what was your response to this question, can you just remind me.
        - Does everybody agree.
        - How about Farrah.
        - Well, um, this is Oliver I heard you say Lunar Orbiter. I'm like, I know you said that. Sorry to answer because you can told Jazmin, but I still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from Part three, because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water
        - Okay. So I was just wondering, like, okay, so I went to NASA with my dad and we went and looked at, like all the spacesuits. And like all this stuff.
        - So, does anybody want to explain their answer to the question initially?
        - And Oliver how about you, what was your answer?
        - Okay, so, Farrah. What equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - To breathe?
        - Oliver would you like to share first
        - Oliver, do you have anything to say?
        - So can you guys tell me a little bit about what do you think this equipment looks like? Luis?
        - Okay. All right. Farrah?
        - If you were to go to the moon Jazmin What would you do to try to water there, what would you do Jazmin?
        - yeah go ahead Jazmin
        - They found lots of um, well they found water, they found amounts of water.
        - I yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Yeah, I said the lunar orbiter because it says, and NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Good i'm glad okay i'm Farrah why don't you tell me a little bit about your answer now.
        - or anyone else can jump in if you'd like, are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water? yes, Farrah.
        - But I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Teacher? Yes. Yeah, I just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut.
        - yeah I said microscope was the equipment.
        - yeah yeah Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oliver and Jazmin you can go, because you already went yesterday.
        - Right exactly can anybody else tell us anything they read in the article.
        -  So yes, would you like to share with your response to begin with.
        - Seems to be where we're at. Jazmin, do you have something to share.
        - Oh yeah absolutely so what I said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - yeah okay well I forgot the same answer as Farrah that is um microscope.
        - I said on water can be split into two parts, oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Uh huh. Okay. So I said, or something different. I said umm
        - Luis.
        - It was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts.
        - Farrah. What was it looking for
        - Okay well so two things one for my answer, I said well that scientists be found creators, full of water on the moon, and so actually I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Jazmin? What do you say again, can you say again.
        - Yeah so i said NASA sent a small machine.
        - What do you know about equipment used in space.
        - So no, not for a long time. I don't think that the evidence is
        - Your answer what was your answer.
        - Oliver. Can you tell me
        - Yeah. Sure. I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - i'm Farrah what where did your group choose as the most important word in the question.
        - I can go first.
        - Or you went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff.
        - Oliver would you like to give your answer to the reading into the question.
        - Also, let's hear
        - Would anybody else like to raise your hand and share what they answered for that question.
        - yeah so.
        - Yeah, Jazmin, what do you think
        -  we're gonna actually go to the passage right now, so I have Farrah could you tell us your answer to the question to question one again.
        - Let's start with your answer. So what did what was Oliver's answer.
        - Well, then yes, go ahead and ask it.
        - Same thing.
        -  Farrah do you want to tell me about your answer.
        - Um, yeah. Well, I was gonna say like I already kind of know all about ease. So I don't think I need any help. I don't think I need to be in this
        - yeah, so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water, 
        - Um, can you repeat your answer for me.
        - I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. But the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question. But I don't understand why mine has a partial response.
        - Yeah, Jazmin. Go ahead.
        - That NASA sent a small machine.
        - Great Chris.
        - Yes, i was going to say investigate. 
        - Um, yeah. So I was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like
        -  Um, and so, yes. Luis Do you have a question.
        - Is your answer is enough. Okay, Jazmin?
        - Jazmin, what did you say was the most important part of the question.
        - awesome Luis what's your question.
        - Oh no, no question. I'm going to read too.
        - Um, let me see. I said, that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. I already know that equipment that they use.
        - so, why now, why do you think that we are not ready for this exploration for a long time.
        - Jazmin please.
        - Who wants to share first.
        - Um, yeah, it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon.
        - The story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel.
        - Okay, so what I circled up. All right, what I was looking at was, I was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts, and that was where was that, oh yeah, in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - What did you discover for that I said find.
        - What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer.
        - What, what did you say for your answer.
        - Well, okay. So one thing that I noticed is I been to NASA with my dad and I love space and I noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that. You know what I mean. So I was wondering if they use that for this too.
        - Luis could you share your answer now, thank you so much for waiting so patiently.
        - Yeah, I learned about how you use microscopes different ways, I think that the thing I want you to the question I have is like why my answer is wrong. 
        - So, Jazmin, what did. What did you say
        - And Oliver, how's your answer doing?
        - yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe. 
        - I'm sorry, Jazmin, what was that?
        - Well, I think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon.
        - um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - OK, that's awesome, Luis. Do you have any thoughts about the water on the moon? Do you think that it's a valuable? Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon is valuable, based off of our article?
        - Um, it said it was a lunar orbiter NASA sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate.
        - Okay, Oliver, what do you think.
        - Oh, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Luis Do you have anything to add, I see your hands raised.
        - I wanted to just Farrah. If you remind me of your answer.
        - Jazmin. Would you remind me of what you had told me before.
        - The Lunar Orbiter.
        - I was, I actually found my information in the first paragraph, because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon.
        - Oh yeah, sure. Um, well, they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon.
        - What was your answer, can you share that with us again.
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, like in the third paragraph, they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic
        - yeah absolutely Okay, so my answer is that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay, I said NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Excuse me, Mr. Teacher. I just thought about something from the story.
        - OK OK so Farrah, can you tell me what you said.
        - yeah what I said was that, yes, it's it is.
        - So I said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - Does anyone know the answer to that question?
        - Who else wants to share their answer and what they got.
        - So Pearson was talking about how he went to NASA. And he like got to go and visit with his dad. And so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the, like, um like, it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up, which is pretty cool.
        - Chris um So what did you learn about those craters on the moon.
        - Alright, so um Farrah do you want to share the answer that you got for the first question yeah sure okay.
        - And then Chris Do you remember what you said.
        -  All right, Jazmin. Have you talked it out.
        - I said that I used to small machine.
        - Excellent, Farrah, could you read us what your response was to question number one, please.
        - um well I sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Can I hear some of your responses.
        - And Oliver I noticed that you circled the same thing is what Farrah did
        - Yeah, I talked about equipment in my answer. 
        - And it's it's asking us to find an equipment.
        - Okay um so I wasn't sure, but I heard Chris and Luis saying that Jazmin's  answer was right, so I I said um NASA sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - There are many volunteers. Farrah yes go ahead.
        - What was your answer, let me hear it one more time.
        - OK, so my answer was basically no like I don't think it's very convincing.
        - Okay, my answer is that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay everyone, do you mind giving me your answers again, really quickly, before I give you some feedback.
        - So, you told me to look again and see if I can add more details to my answer. And I found more details in part two, which is where my answer came from.
        - Oh yeah, I think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. Also, you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon.
        - Good. Okay. So, I think, paragraph two, is really important. So, Farrah. I asked you to do something. So did you
        - Okay, so I said that they found a lot of water in the craters.
        - Well, there's multiple pieces of equipment. So they're all right. Um, what was your original answer? Let's build off of that.
        - Um, I forgot.
        - On actually I just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful. So thank you so much.
        - Say it's not a good answer. I just say it might be some improvement there. So, Jazmin, what you got.
        - Okay yeah I was saying, I was thinking well it says it'll land at the south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Um, yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Can I have another volunteer to tell me what they said.
        - Oh, whoa, whoa, what did you respond to that question.
        - Does anyone want to volunteer to go ahead and go first.
        - I am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter. And I think that that's like, because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately
        - S Chris. Thank you so much. You're very brave to go first. It's always a bit of a challenge, so well done.
        - So I thought the key word. The most important word was equipment, because that Word tells you that you're looking for, like, a tool for your answer.
        - um yeah OK, so my initial answer, I was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which I knew, because I already knew that and then um.
        - Alright so Chris, what were the key words that you underlined from the sentence. 
        - So what are you thinking Chris. I haven't heard much from you.
        - yeah Chris go ahead and share with us.
        - I'm gonna say convincing.
        - Well, I was talking about.
        - Yeah, yeah, in the in the second paragraph, it talks about how NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Farrah, what did they discover
        - I wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon.
        - rocket fuel all
        - Yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay.
        - Chris. What equipment do you think that they use.
        - yeah yeah sure.
        - But thank you so much for your answer Chris, and I think it is now time to move on to Luis are you ready to share your answer Luis.
        - Ok so what key words did anyone circle?
        - Sure. So basically what I said was that that NASA used a small machine. And that's like the machine that they sent to the moon.
        - Oliver go ahead.
        - What was your answer to that question.
        - What do you think, Farrah.
        - Exactly. Very good. So what equipment did they use to discover the water
        - All right. Did you guys circle, a word.
        - I would like to at least in the beginning, let's let's let Jazmin and Chrise let us know what they got for the first question. 
        - Never know! Jazmin, what do you think okay so um.
        - On Okay, I mean it's kind of like what Oliver said Oh, but cuz at the end, it says like they need to come up with a plan, and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money, do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like Well, no, because it'll take a long time.
        - Oh yeah well um I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks.
        - Can someone tell me what two words that they circled
        - Yes, that is what it's called. So did any of you guys, Farrah, Oliver, Chris, Luis, Did any of you guys see any other information about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - that's tell me tell me okay.
        - Well, I have a few things to say. So my first answer was, it was
        - Okay, so, um, you can answer the question now.
        - So what's your revised answered.
        - yeah okay so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - I can read it to you yeah sure, could you read it to me real quick sure.
        - Right. Go ahead, Oliver. Did you have a question.
        - Okay, Jazmin, do you have anything to add to what Chris said
        - yeah Okay, thank you Luis why don't we look at your response.
        - Chris, do you have something you'd like to add.
        - And water on the moon okay i'm go back, could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question, what was the what how did you first answer it.
        - Okay, and you did answer the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. What was your answer to that question.
        - Here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon.
        - and Luis that would you like to read as your answer.
        - Once you read that to go back to Chris Chris. What do you think about the answer to the question is
        - You want me to share now.
        - Yes, I can.
        - Oliver you said the same thing?
        - How about a Chris or Luis. And I haven't heard from you. Yet, what were your takeaways.
        - On. I was just wondering, because I guess I'm still not sure why my answer's wrong.
        - Can you repeat that please
        -  So let's talk about some of your answers. Would one of you like to volunteer your answer. Luis
        - Okay, and what was your answer.
        - Does anybody have any ideas Chris yeah.
        - Mm hmm. And then what did we use to go back and find our answer.
        - And I think the answer is all, let me see what.
        - But i'm excited to hear how you connect all that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water, do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article, we read.
        - And we, where does the water hide on the moon?
        - Good answer do you want to read it to everyone i'm ago.
        - Okay What was your answer.
        - Yes Jazmin what is your question?
        - Oliver, you said that you circled the same as Farrah. So can you tell me what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon?
        - Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle.
        - Okay, so I think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like, stuff like that, you know,
        - What else do you think would make water valuable, Oliver. What are your thoughts on that.
        - What anyone else, like to share.
        - Okay, so, basically, I said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then I said.
        - Oh man oh I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.
        - Your guys's responses for what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm wondering if anyone could share out one of the tools that they remember reading about.
        - And we're circling evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question. So Farrah, can you tell me what you thought on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what did they send to investigate the moon's craters?
        - and, Luis, what did you put
        - Good. So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage
        - Well, I was just saying I shouldn't be in this group because I already know all about space.
        - So, Sabina, do you care to share your response with us.
        - yeah yeah I want to go is that okay.
        - um well, I thought equipment also um like Farrah did um but I guess another important word would probably be water.
        - Yeah, the microscope.
        - What did you put?
        - Okay. And, um, Chris. What about you, is there something really interesting about the reading.
        - Yeah, sure, I said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Now Chris, can you tell us what you you wrote as your response.
        -  Does anyone want to volunteer and answer.
        - Well, so well, my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I didn't. I already submitted it, I don't remember what I wrote down, um, let me see if it's on my slide.
        - Well, okay, so I tried to focus on the equipment. 
        -  now Chris. Can you repeat your answer for me.
        - OK. Good. Good. Sounds good. So let's see. Let me see. I know you guys had already submitted me some questions. Farrah, can you talk about your question a little bit? Your answer that you gave me.
        - Oliver, what did you see why you were reading
        - Yeah, well, I know that all that. And I know that. Well, I went to NASA with my dad. And so I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yeah, Chris. Go ahead. You can respond
        - Jazmin, what did you find in the text.
        - Okay okay all right, and how about you remind me of your answer now.
        - All right, dad i'm so sorry for keeping you waiting What would you like to share.
        - Okay, so um I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Oliver did you did you what did you think about the Lunar orbiter because it's just so amazing like Could you imagine the way that this this orbiter is able to reach a part of the moon that we've never been able to reach before I thought that was so interesting.
        - Yeah, go ahead Farrah
        - So I thought, when we were discussing up like I think Jazmin as a really good theory and I I could see how it could be the Lunar orbiter I can I can see that now.
        - Okay, so let's go over some of our answers Farrah. Do you want to give your answer.
        - Um, so I basically when I went in. I circle.
        - Alright, so let's move on um let's see uh Jazmin can you read what your answer was please.
        - I guess put more of the question in my answer. So I couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - What was your answer, can you remind me.
        - Thank you Chris What was your answer again.
        -  So let me. I'm gonna have someone volunteer. If you want to tell me your answer from before.
        - I'm sure I can. I think Luis has his hand raised.
        - Um, yeah, so I thought the equipment. I think that the microscope, I agree with Farrah.
        - Okay, all right, how did everyone else do with their answers, could you
        - Farrah, what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today?
        - Um, yeah, we found some stuff.
        - Ok well, Luis let's talk about your response, we'll jump over to Farrah and then we'll all get a second to revise our responses. so Luis What did you share for the equipment scientists use?
        - Your answer was what?
        - All right, Deb, is there a different word that you found
        -  yeah let's see do you want to add something.
        - Alright, Luis, so without looking at the text, do you know the answer to that question?
        - Um, I said I'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - The word starts with an e.
        - Okay okay put your hand down. So Chris, what are you thinking?
        - Right is really excellent tool all right um Oliveron thank def, thank you for waiting patiently, would you like to go with your answer, do you mind sharing your answer with the whole class.
        - yeah sure Okay, I said what did I see I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay. So your answer. Tell me what your answer was, again,
        - yeah well actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Jazmin I would love for you to tell us why what you found in the fifth paragraph.
        - Oh yeah, sure. Okay, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Farrah. If you have something to say.
        - Yeah Luis What's up
        - Okay, yes. I think that the most important word is discover because like finding it
        - yeah so um I read that Okay, the water is microscopic and so for the equipment, I said I said, you need a microscope to look at it really closely, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - What do you think Jazmin? What equipment did they use?
        - yeah okay Chris, so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny, tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them.
        - Jazmin, why do you go ahead.
        - Okay cool, I think we are all really excited to hear what you have to say so i'm going to go ahead and start with Farrah I know you have your paper in front of you Farrah Would you mind reading aloud what answer you gave to that question, we had.
        - 10 more seconds 987654321. All right, let's actually start with Farrah, and we'll move our way around the circle to Luis, so, what word did you circle Farrah.
        - And then while you're doing that. Can I hear from some of the people that haven't talked about what about Chris or Jazmin, and when you tell me what  what you read.
        - The same ones, I guess, everybody else because also the only two that I saw.
        - yeah Okay, so I would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter.
        - Um, yeah, this is Luis.
        - Chris, you too?
        - what are you working on in this response.
        - Yeah, we have to go to lunch. 
        - Yeah, I guess, the thing that I had was that I was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong. 
        - Oh yeah well, I said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh yeah sure, so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon.
        - Okay, so you said, I have to look for more detail. And so I found about this machine, a few things. So first it said that it was called the Lunar Orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters.
        - Alright guys, so where we left off. We were talking about and the periodic element table and Mr. Luis in your response to this second question. Do you remember what you said about the water
        - Chris Jazmin or Luis do you guys have an answer to share Chris.
        - I mean was different from there. So I don't know. They said, Yeah, but I said no. I said no. It's not ready yet.
        - Yes. Can I go
        - yeah so I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope.. to look really closely.
        - Is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences.
        - yeah go ahead Oliver.
        - Oh, oh okay well at first I didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a key word like you said so now, I said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah. Um, so my answer is the microscope.
        - On well I circled the same thing as Farrah on the bottom of the page we I didn't like circle it because she circled it, but we had, we had the same answer. What I circled the same thing. Um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - about the previous texts and science class okay all right Farrah I have your response up here would you like to share out loud with the whole class, so we can go ahead, yes Luis?
        - What did you say water is a valuable resource or not.
        - If there's water on the moon, 
        - Well, who else Jazmin you had a answer also when.
        - Let me go to Oliver. What did you circle.
        -  mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but when I talked to Jazmin and Luis they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is.
        - Jazmin, what are you thinking
        - Great all right now let's get some more quiet hands, what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question.
        - Yeah, yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the Lunar orbiter and.
        - yeah I can share so.
        - You can raise your hand and i'll pick you so you can share the word you chose.
        - Um, yeah. So I said that scientists found craters that were just full of water.
        - Farrah please go ahead.
        - So, can you tell us a little bit about some of the equipment that was mentioned in the article.
        - Okay um so Oh, let me see.
        - Basically, I wasn't quite sure about microscopic. I think I know what it means, but I wasn't totally sure
        - Um, well, I think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that.
        - Okay, so I think the most important part of the question is evidence
        - Oh OK, and then Oliver can you tell me what you said, as your as your answer?
        - Well, so I actually have my opinion is that water um yeah I can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable.
        -  so um, I would like, for Chris, please, if you would mind sharing what your response was that would be great.
        - Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next group so we'll have to see you later.
        - Okay well oh yeah go ahead Jazmin.
        - Yes. Is that what you answer for the question Chris
        - um so I was just gonna say that this has been really fun and I think that i've got it all figured out, so I.
        - Okay, so, Luis, did you discover how to, did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - let's just go left to right Farrah, what do you have for the first question, what are some examples of equipment found on the moon.
        - nd first I'd like to address Farrah Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us.
        - Alright, Jazmin, you kind of want to explain your answer for us?
        - yeah so I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Well, let's review some answers. And then we'll see about that. Okay. So, Luis I noticed that you when you answered. Can you repeat your answer for me.
        - Actually, I wrote about the oxygen tanks too. Because that equipment and the question as our equipment, and so I said, you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank.
        - Farrah do you want to share what you attend your interview.
        - So we had a disagreement.
        - Yep, sure can. Okay, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Are you finished?
        - yeah I circled the same as Farrah. 
        - Oliver what was your answer to that question.
        - Oh yeah Jazmin What was your answer again.
        - Yeah, I don't think it's actually, I guess, I guess I don't really have a question, because I understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not
        - Um. Oliver. How about you?
        - Okay, so I said, my answer was NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So investigate is when you sort of... Look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff.
        - Right. Who's ready to share. Thank you
        - Anybody have any ideas?
        - Oh, did you have a second answer, maybe or any thoughts new thoughts that came to mind after reading through it.
        - You ready okay let me hear it.
        - Okay, well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - yeah so Luis did you learn anything from this from this reading.
        - Alright Luis so I don't you remind me of what your answer was for the first question.
        - um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice.
        - Let's hear from your partner Jazmin and see what she has to say.
        - Oh yeah, okay. So basically, you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Sorry to interrupt. I'm sorry but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - So that I have some of your answers. And I just want to have you guys Reiterate to me what your original answer was,
        - What did you like the most, Chris?
        - yeah it's really, really interesting um and one thing I thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water, it was so small.
        - What okay um I just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but I don't know how I want to know that i'm.
        - And how about you Oliver? What word do you think is real important in that question, to give us that clue to find the right answer?
        - awesome um Luis What about you do you want to share your answer?
        - Well, I don't, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Who would like to share one of theirs, the response that they gave to that question.
        - yeah I said I said to small machine and I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - While Chris goes back to read what anyone else, like to share their responses.
        - I said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - That water on the moon could be valuable. It can be of use for the astronauts so Jazmin, you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct
        - I said equipment, I said equipment to.
        - So they used the lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  And I got this.
        - I'm I'm trying to remember. I don't remember what I put. Let me just see. Because I circled it on my tablet oh yeah I circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from Farrah all the way down to Luis from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question.
        - Oliver. What was your answer.
        - Ah, say that statement. One more time.
        - And while you do that i'm going to have another student share their response does another student want to share their their answer Farrah yes.
        - Yeah, so I was just going to ask like,
        - Does anybody want to volunteer their answer?
        - but let's get to Luis. Luis read your answer.
        - Farrah What did you say.
        -  and Jazmin, what did you say that small machine was called again.
        - All right, let's move our last one Farrah What did you circle.
        - One.
        - got it got it and Chris Would you mind sharing with us your response to question one.
        - Do you want to hear mine?
        - Um, yeah, I think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like, you know, the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface, but they were still able to find it using the microscope.
        - Who would you like to go?
        - yeah I said that scientists found creators, full of water on the moon.
        - So Farrah, let's start with you. What was your answer to the question number one.
        - So what do you think, do you think based on what you've heard and read in the text you think finding one on the moon can be valuable.
        - Does someone want to give it a try, and try to combine those two answers. Maybe Oliver?
        - yeah so um well Actually, I know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because I went to NASA so I know they use a lot of equipment.
        - I said, equipment and discover.
        - Yeah, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        -  Chris, can you tell me what your response was.
        - To tell me about this reading and tell me what equipment, the day scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
        - you said they found a Small machine and now you think what was the second half of your sentence?
        - Well, I was talking about the grand Canyon I was talking about remember.
        - Oliver what are you thinking?
        - Okay, it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon, and I found my answer in paragraph three
        - Farrah. I, it seems like you and Oliver here, we're kind of on the same path. Farrah. Can you read your response for me, please.
        - Farrah, you want to go first. Oh, and Chris awesome Farrah, you go first. For me, okay.
        -  but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer Oliver
        - I could.
        - Oh well, the scientists, the found these craters full of water.
        -  What are some things you can use oxygen for? What do you think Luis?
        - So Def, do you have something to add to this? You had your hand raised.
        - So do you want to offer your answer what was your different answer.
        - awesome we're gonna come back together Luis What did you learn from Jazmin's response.
        - I went to NASA so.
        - Okay, well, I was just telling Farrah and of how I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Um. Equipment?
        - Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I think that's right.
        - So you when we went through and circled the evidence from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, what did you say again Luis.
        - Is there anyone who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two.
        - Good. I think I had the right answer. I said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water. So why am I in this group.
        - Well, I think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water. Um, well, like when they were on Earth, you know, because that's how you can look from Earth on
        - Um, so I saw I listened to Jazmin's answer. She said that it was, um, the Lunar Orbiter. I think
        - does anyone with anyone like to go first Luis firsthand what's up.
        - All right, so can I have someone raised their hand and share what answer that they got for number one
        -  Jazmin, what was your answer to this question.
        - um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - With that being said, let's talk about all of your answers that you guys gave to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon. Who wants to volunteer to go first, was what they said for their answer.
        -  still kind of confused.
        - Okay, so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that Jazmin was talking about.
        - The lunar orbiter.
        - Farrah. Can you remind me of your answer.
        - Okay, so who can tell me, one of the words that they thought of that means the same thing as equipment anyone have a word that they wrote down.
        - Okay, so basically what what we were discussing, we didn't agree, but I thought that the answer was the small machine which when I was looking was saying that, was a, was the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - So, Luis. Tell me what
        - Do you want to share it with the group yeah okay.
        -  um So do you want to go first, so how did you answer this question.
        - Oh well, then, would you like to start, do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - um I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah, I kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet. You know what I mean like that we can't, we can't just use the water because it's all ice, you know.
        - Well, I was thinking about the water can use. You can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon.
        - Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to
        - Oh yeah. Okay. So I said, that a scientist, would need to use a microscope. 
        - would anyone like to volunteer to go first and start us off by reading your answer.
        - yeah so you can take water, and you can split it into two parts, you can make oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Yeah, we found those two pieces of equipment. Yeah. The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope, and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water
        - Does anybody else want to volunteer their answer?
        - Hi. Yeah, I was really cool and I think for me, like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment. They have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it, that's really cool.
        - Of course, thank you Luis I appreciate that, and thank you for being so patient and Chris, where you done speaking or did you want to add more about what the Lunar orbiter does.
        - Well, I was just going to say, I kind of know all about space already. So I don't even think I should be in this group.
        - Go ahead, Jazmin.
        - Exactly. I'm Chris, do you have anything to add.
        - Okay, so who would like to share their response first.
        - Farrah, what is valuable mean to you.
        - Okay, so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh, I said that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - um yeah well I had circled the same thing as Farrah. I circled that last sentence in paragraph three, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - I'm going to start with Chris right there in the middle. Can you tell me what your answer to the question was, remind me, please.
        - um. My answer was Scientists use lots of equipment Like oxygen tanks.
        - yeah um well, I said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Definitely. So, well, we found the same to that Oliver and Farrah. I guess because there's the small machine on the
        - In the craters.  That one was in my answer. 
        - Okay well so Farrah just had a really good point. Farrah. Can you repeat that for Oliver for me.
        - Yes. Luis. Go ahead.
        - Okay, and what, what did you find what what do you like to share together as a group.
        -  Luis What was your answer.
        - Okay perfect sounds good let's see we have Chris and Luis left would either of you like to go okay go for it Chris.
        - Okay, well, I okay So what about mine, because I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, well, I said that NASA send a small machine.
        - Great, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your answers.
        - amazing all right, well, I was just wondering if anyone wanted to share just their thoughts on the text, what did you think about it were you interested in learning about water on the moon, is it something that maybe isn't your favorite subject any any thoughts um let's see Chris.
        - Well, I mean, I, I circled the same thing as Farrah. Um, so I guess I mean I don't know why I'm in this group. If we're right then what's wrong with with my answer?
        - Um Let's have someone else talk for a second if anyone has their hand raised.
        - um so yeah I thought that Farrah was right and I, I found that evidence myself what I noticed was that
        - And um so actually for me, I was just gonna say that I think that i've got everything all figured out now, so I was gonna say I think about good can I go back to my desk.
        - yeah Okay, so I said i'm.
        - Will you read your answer for me please?
        - You did. Okay. Perfect. Alright, so let's start with Jazmin's group. What are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon Chris.
        - Oh, I'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Let's look at your answer. Luis
        - You know all about space. Let's see. So even if I remember correctly, you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, okay. Now who wants to share with me. What words did you choose what words from the question. Did you circle. Yes. Luis
        - Okay, Farrah. What do you think
        - Okay, my stopwatch is actually broken, but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then Chris, what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf, and how they actually maybe got that water.
        - To be connected with that they use a small machine.
        - Exactly yep exactly yeah what did what would you have said Chris What was your answer the second time you.
        - Okay. All right. Let's talk in our group about no question, Chris, can you read your answer that you gave
        - I said no, not for a long time.
        - Does anyone else want to share their answers?
        - Oh, that's a really, that's an interesting question. Um,
        - Great, Jazmin, what about you.
        - Basically, NASA sent this small machine. And that was what was like, what found all the water. 
        - So I think they sent a small machine.
        -  Jazmin, what do you think?
        - What else did you guys decide with your group discussion.
        - I have that same answer us Farrah.
        - before heading out into the solar system. So let's review why water is valuable and I know that Oliver had a response as well, what was your response, before we go over the reasons why water is valuable.
        - Okay, so I said NASA send a small machine.
        - Teacher.
        - awesome Thank you. Hey Luis, how's your search going.
        - wow excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, because I already corrected my answer so i'm good.
        - um you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So I want Oliver to go first. And I want him to remind me of what his answer was.
        - Chris. What do you think, do you think water could be valuable from the moon.
        - And Chris, what did you just tell me about the-what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?
        - Oliver, do you have anything to add? I haven't heard from you.
        - um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues. 
        - Sure and Luis I saw that your hand was up. Do you have a question.
        - Yeah, yeah. We'd love to go first. Okay, so, um, well, we had the same answer. Originally, so our, our
        - and then Luis You said that you knew a lot about space. I bet you really enjoyed this reading. Then what did you find out that NASA used?
        - OK, so now that giving you that time would anyone like to share what words to use circle that you think are the best words that will help you answer the question.
        - So using these all of this information, what are we thinking.
        - No, I was gonna say the same thing as Farrah, but I'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong. I don't quite understand.
        - All right, do you have the answer in front of you would you like to share with the whole class.
        - Yeah, so that basically like when you look at it, the third paragraph. Like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up.
        - yeah Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share your answer.
        - I said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Farrah repeat for me what your answer was. Real quick. 
        - All right, perfect so Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me.
        - um well I guess yeah that's that's similar for me, because I was looking for equipment and I saw the microscope and arm and I was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it, and I saw that in um in that paragraph three.
        -  Luis What would you change your answer to?
        - can anyone maybe chime in on that 
        - yeah okay um.
        - i'll go.
        - So could anyone tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this?
        - Can you read me your answer please.
        - Here. Yeah. So I listened to the facts and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong. I said that NASA scientists small machine.
        - Yeah. So basically, my response was, I circled the same thing as survey.
        -  and you said that you change your answer, could you tell me your first answer then what you changed it to.
        - let's take a minute right now and try to revise our answers and then Luis let's start with you for sharing out a revised answer to this question.
        - All right, who can raise their hand to tell us what the main ideas.
        - All right, Luis would you like your turn now.
        - Oh, we can go first.
        - Farrah you've been waiting so patiently, can you go first, what do you need.
        - I can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yes, I, like my turn, thank you.
        - And I see
        - and Chris. Can you tell us what you think the answer is, and what you found in the text.
        -  Can someone else tell me what other words they circled or phrases that they circled in this question.
        - Okay, now let's go over to the first group.
        - And I wanted to check in and see what evidence you guys circled maybe you guys could give me the number that you circled in our readings for where you found that answer.
        - Yeah. I mean, it's about science, though. It's not about the story. But I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay, great so would you like to share with the with the group what you found what text you found to answer that question, that would be super helpful.
        - So I looked at, paragraph two, and what we see and like what I was listening to everybody. I'm
        - Farrah. Would you remind me of your answer again.
        - Um, I said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - So I said that NASA send a small machine.
        - Okay, savana what what where did you write down.
        - Okay, and Oliver can we talk about your answer a little bit tell me what you answered.
        - Um, I
        - I yeah that is what I had also said yes.
        - Alright, Chris. So what would you say in your answer.
        - Okay, who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt.
        - Well, so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch. I'm really sorry, but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question.
        - that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer.
        - Now once you read your statement again.
        - um yeah so um.
        - So remind me of your answer one more time.
        - Okay, so I highlighted two things first I highlighted the microscope because I thought that was something that you really mean like would be important.
        - And Chris, you had the hands on I guess you can tell me why you think.
        - So I would appreciate it if you would just kind of listen and maybe you will learn something new. So, Farrah,  can you read to me your answer about the question that was asked.
        - That sounds great. Do you want to start?
        - They do do that so Chris was that your answer for the.
        - Oh yeah we both said for the appointment, we both said i'm microscope.
        - Who else would like to share that what they said as their answer.
        - Okay, well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today. So how did scientists discover water on the moon.
        - Well, I was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything, but I circled the last sentence, just like Farrah. So I was just trying to think if what you told Farrah, I guess, is the same for me.
        - Oliver What about you?
        - A microscope.
        - I'm. Excuse me. Excuse me. This is Luis.
        - what about you Farrah.
        - What was that
        - Good i'm Chris Luis didn't want to do you want to share? Yes, Chris. 
        - Thanks Luis. Can you guys quickly share what it is that you were just answering about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon just in a couple of words. Luis can we start with you.
        - Ah, OK so Farrah are you going to share the same answer as Oliver, the microscope too.
        - Okay yeah I got it so what the teacher saying Farrah it's a microscope was used to look at the water, but the Lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water.
        - Prompts student to state or restate a response
        - Can you share with your friends. What was your response.
        - yeah she.
        - I would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong, why am I in this group.
        - So I said that NASA sent a small machine. And then when I was reading, I said NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Okay. Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is
        - Yes, it's the Lunar orbiter so um can you restate your answer, for me, now that we have that information can you restate your answer to that initial question?
        - What was your answer.
        - Well, I think that it's
        - Yeah, so I think one thing that I thought was really interesting was when I was looking for the for the equipment, but to see like how much equipment they have to use it. There's a lot of it.
        - Okay, so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - what's going on Jazmin.
        -  Jazmin What did you share what did you find as your response to that question.
        - Okay, so, um, I think, a part that you're talking about is the part in part two, where it says about looking for the ice deposits, because I guess the water was not just water. It was ice and they found it as ice ice form.
        - But we're going to figure that out right now, so can you. Could you remind me what your answer was
        -  yeah My answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oliver, can you read to me what your answer was to number one.
        - Okay, so I thought, a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool.
        - Then I don't know why my answer is wrong. Because I said a small machine and they asked about equipment.
        - Oliver, do you have an idea?
        - alright Farrah what were you thinking.
        - Okay Oliver said, Well, we actually had the same answer, which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope.
        - Yeah, okay. So one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen. And it says that
        - Nice and Jazmin.
        - Excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group. I know all about speed.
        - Um, so I think that the um the equipment was the microscope, like in the reading. It says you need a microscope, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So now Jazmin, can you tell me what you answered what your answer was.
        - Farrah. I know you said equipment, and I think that's important. But actually, I think the more important word is actually discover
        - Well, I guess we were listening to, as you were saying this stuff with with Jazmin. So I guess the, the difference is like what's the best answer.
        - Farrah and Oliver were you able to find out more information  through working together?
        - so let's see Chris and Jazmin who would like to share next.
        - anyone else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment.
        - So, uh, and I'm so sorry. Chris, I might have dismiss heard you. Could you repeat your response for me, word for word just an I make sure I
        - All right, let's go Chris, what did you circle.
        - OK. OK, so here we go. Um, water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to
        - So Jazmin, what answer did you write for this question?
        - yeah so Luis What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me.
        - I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yes that was me.
        -  I said NASA centers small machine.
        -  Okay, so um well I circled equipment, because well, so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so I picked equipment.
        - And then Jazmin, what did you say astronauts could do
        - Well Jazmin what were you thinking.
        - And oh gosh, I don't even remember what the question was now.
        - Yes, so it seems like for me okay so originally I said that.
        - When you work with your partner, you're going to share your answer.
        - It said that
        - yeah sure I said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Oh yeah Okay, so I can, I can tell you that, basically, I was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Thank you Jazmin alright Chris, can you go ahead and read your response to me Chris.
        - What was your answer again.
        - Okay, so basically, the first thing I was gonna say is that I'm still a little bit confused. And I think what I'm confused about is how Like how we can make sure that our answers are complete.
        - Okay, Farrah, can you please, um,
        - So Chris, what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon. What did. What did the reading tell you?
        - Okay, Chris, would you like to read your answer.
        - Jazmin, is there anything that you want to add
        - And so I circled small machine, my answer is NASA Center small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me a little bit about your two answers.
        - Well I was thinking that you could use water to grow things, so that we could have like a garden, can you imagine how beautiful it woud be?
        - um yeah so I circled the same thing as some fan oh okay.
        - Jazmin why don't you share with us.
        - Um, well, I just kind of kept looking around and look what I was like I i looked in paragraph three.
        - But what did Chris and Jazmin tell us about how the microscope, got up there.
        - Do you want to start.
        - What is it, Jazmin.
        - Oliver. Did you find anything.
        - Does anyone want to give me just let me know what they answered, or what they think if they even think that they want to change their answer what equipment was used
        - okay so on Oliver, could you please read for me your answer.
        - Teacher : Awesome. So, Farrah. What did you say, What was your response for The understanding what equipment did scientists use
        - yeah I was just I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks. 
        - I think they use the small machine machine. And it's called a lunar orbiter. I think that's what they used to discover the water
        - So actually fortunately it's time for us to.
        - Okay, so what I said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and then I realized that.
        - Um, I guess I saw the same thing cuz I I just kept seeing microscope, and I kept thinking about microscopes for some reason.
        - Yes, would anyone like to volunteer to go first.
        - Well, paragraph two that's where they talk about the Lunar orbiter.
        - I mean, this is me, Farrah. I looked at over and I don't understand why why the microscope is raw
        - Okay, I think I see it, would you like to share what you see.
        - All right before our little time is up and we need a good clear, concise answer. Anyone have one that they would like to share?
        - Okay. So, all right. So my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and
        - Well, first of all, can you tell us what you said, what can we do with that water.
        - So, so I just need to circle, then maybe I just need to circle lunar orbiter?
        - Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their group when they've improved.
        - let's go ahead.
        - i'm so actually I understood a lot, so I was thinking about it, and then, when you were talking to Luis and Jasper, it really made me think that like.
        - Can I go. Can I go
        - yeah so that's one reason does anybody have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource?
        - Okay yeah Well, my answer is scientists found careers, full of water on the moon.
        - um I think for me like what I noticed is like kind of similar to like I I bring a lot of my like background knowledge, because I know all about this stuff.
        - Yes, in the way that I underlined was well action like two words. Equipment and discover. 
        - That
        - Chris what was your answer?
        -  Jazmin What about you, did anything stick out as interesting to you?
        - Farrah.
        - Oliver could you repeat your answer as well.
        - um so.
        - Great um well Luis doing that Jazmin, can I ask you about your answer.
        - Well, yeah. So I was I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that.
        - Okay, well, I said um scientists found craters for water on the moon, with the Lunar orbiter.
        - So what can we what answer can we come up with to use the evidence?
        - Okay, why don't you share with us.
        - You found oxygen tank.
        - Okay, so I said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon.
        - Chris. Go ahead. What do you think, Farrah, go ahead.
        - What evidence, do you think you put in your answer Farrah?
        -  so I think that's can take us back to what's Farrah and Oliver have been looking at.Farrah and Oliver, have found the answer to this entire question by now? would you like to share your answer?
        - Anybody else want to talk discuss their answer yes, Jazmin.
        - and Chris or Farrah do either one of you want to share sure Chris.
        - So. Would anybody like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon S
        - The small things on the moon was having to be looked at, through a what Farrah?
        - Yes, I said that necessity. A small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        -  But let's hold that yes, you have your hand raised. What do you think the most important word is
        - Oh, I did as well.
        - All right, great job so based on the question that Jazmin just read out to us what should our answer be.
        - um yeah well, so my answer is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - OK so Luis what's another way that water could be valuable, what's another thing they could use water for? 
        - Ok. Um. Farrah I just asked you to share out your response to the question of what equipment
        - Well yeah, I was gonna say, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading. But I know that they use, you know,
        - Um, yeah. So it looks like um Farrah and I circled at the beginning, we circled the microscope, because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small, but um
        - Alright, would anyone like to share what they wrote for those questions Chris go ahead.
        - Would anyone like to share out the answer as to what they believe. Scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - The microscope premier
        - Okay yeah so I said no, not for a long time.
        - I said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore.
        - All right, perfect which student wants to speak out first about what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon Jazmin.
        - Um Jazmin. Go ahead.
        - All right, Chris you're up next.
        - Do you remember your first answer.
        - um so they're looking for water right, and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water.
        - All right, Jazmin. Go ahead.
        - Okay. All right. Then what did you underline or circle.
        - Well, that's a great question. I think what was interesting was mostly the fact that I'm like well
        - let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts.
        - Uhm what equipment did you find in the texts that scientists used to discover the water on the moon?
        - I'm yeah i mean
        -  um yeah well, I think I thought that's all figured out now so i'm good.
        - You guys want to share your responses to this article.
        - So with that, I circled was ice, ice deposits
        - Yeah, I just have something to say. And that's, I just wanted to remind you, and also you do that. My dad is actually an astronaut.
        - Jazmin, how about you?
        - How about you Luis.
        - So who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment.
        - I was thinking, maybe discover.
        - yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um, but I still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see. don't you need a microscope.
        - Alright, Oliver. Did you find something else.
        - Okay, so I said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before Luis interrupted um so well I picked the microscope because they said, the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope  
        - Yeah, sure. So basically what what I said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - Okay. So I said,
        - Well I also said equipment.
        - Well, I think it was informative because I realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water.
        - Can anybody tell me?
        - Luis. 
        - So do you want to share answer with the group and we can work through it together.
        - Well, I think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon.
        - Yes, Jazmin.
        - Would you yeah yeah exactly right all right let's look at your response now Chris.
        - Did you guys did you have any luck, searching for more stuff over there.
        - Okay, Oliver. What about you, was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading.
        - yeah, so I think is when something sort of goes around something else.
        - Um, yeah. So I said that. Um, no, like, I didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet.
        - Oh Okay, thank you alright Jazmin why don't you go ahead and read your answer.
        - Rocket ships, rocket ships
        - Luis, what do you think?
        - Chris, did you find the piece of equipment in the text, yet.
        - Who would like to go next.
        -  and so Luis go ahead and share it you're about to share.
        - um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because I got that one right out of the story.
        - I get that they sent the lunar orbiter, but I cricled the same answer. as Farrah, and, and I still don't. I don't see why it's not the miscroscope, because it sounds like they used that too, right?
        - I still have to say I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - um I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know I went to NASA so I know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Sure, we can do that. Um, okay, so I said, you need a microscope to do the water
        - it says Farrah, can you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in number three
        - Chris, you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon, do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon.
        - Okay, um, Luis, what are you thinking
        - Well, I guess, like I'm kind of thinking
        - Does anyone else, want to share they wrote.
        - Okay, so can you share, will you share with the group what your answer was.
        - Coule you repeat your question to your classmates your answer your responses to your classmates?
        - Oliver I haven't heard from you, yet do you think we've found all of the equipment that they used in this text.
        - Oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my, my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope.
        - Oh, in the article I was going to tell you more equipment that I know.
        - Yes, Okay, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Can you read me your answer one more time, please.
        - All right does anybody would like to share the answer.
        -  Okay I saw savannas hand first. What do you think, Farrah.
        - um well, I mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things, because they said equipment not piece of equipment, so I figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep.
        - What anyone else, want to share their answer? Oliver, I know you had a similar answer to what Farrah said, is there anything else you'd like to add to the group answer?
        - Okay, I have been to NASA with my dad. So I know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so.
        - To support what we are trying to say.
        - yeah um well I took all the same thing.
        - Yes, I said NASA send a small machine.
        - i'm Okay, I guess, I have that first part two, because I got equipment, but I don't have anything about the water in the Mon.
        - Do you want to share.
        - The small pieces of ice.
        - Well I guess
        - that's a good idea why don't you do that then.
        - yeah, so I think she should just add the name I think she should just say um.
        - So they used the Lunar Orbiter to discover water. And so we have to go in just a moment. But before we went, I just wanted to thank you for
        - Chris you have a question?
        - Thank you, Luis, and Jazmin. So who would like to share something that they underlined.
        - Okay anyone find any interesting clues.
        - I think we're just so we're just going to pick up right where we left off last time we met so Jazmin why don't you go ahead and share the answer that you had.
        - hmm could you read your answer for me.
        - So anything. Would you like to share
        - Okay, yeah. So my answer to the question was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Okay, so, um, Chris, I agree, partly like yes, it's definitely about water on the moon, but I think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon. Like, it's only on these really small little bits.
        - Okay, what was the second one Jazmin.
        - So that sounds very good. So, would anyone like to open up with what they thought as far as their response to the first discussion question.
        - Okay, it can be at Oliveron. What did you circle the
        - Chris, maybe
        - yeah, Oliver. 
        -  Chris, what was your answer.
        - What about Chris.
        - Jazmin, would you like to add anything to that.
        - Yeah, I found the equipment, but it wasn't an aircraft to I found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah
        - Valuable means like has a lot of value?
        - Would anybody else like to share what they would change their answers?
        - Yeah, I do. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Chris, what would you change your answer to.
        - anybody else like to share what they would change their answer to.
        - yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon.
        - um so Farrah I want to start with you um can you read your initial answer for me
        - How about you, Jazmin.
        - Okay um so he said, NASA.
        - Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, um, we were reading that up first.
        -  Chris. What was your answer.
        - Yeah, okay. So I think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you. You like find something
        - i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right.
        - And Oliver. What was your answer to that question.
        - Chris what what was your answer?
        - Okay, that's two of the key words Jazmin, you can maybe you can give us another one.
        - Okay, so well I looked through the word machine.
        - yeah I said masses into small machine.
- intent: r130.1
  examples: |
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit.
        - Well, it's not completely wrong.
        - Okay, okay, um,
        - Right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right?
        - You say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water. Right. And yes, you're right. There is there is a part of the equipment. 
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track. 
        - But it's important that we add that we have both things. And if you want it bad microscope, you can. 
        - Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine. you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um.
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope.
        - Oh, that's really interesting. I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a
        - So I think the three that we've identified so far, all together, will will lead us to a great answer and I think, specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text. 
        - Let's talk about it, Luis. So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's. 
        - So, Jazmin and Luis also found different paragraphs. So there are multiple answers.
        - So next time. It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you guys are highlighting the right answers in the passage
        - but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand.
        - yeah, so that's what we're going to find out, right now. so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong. it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer, so we got part of it right, but we want to get the whole thing OK.
        - Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there. 
        - yeah, that makes sense.
        -  And because Luis just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this. And so, Hey Luis I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct.
        - Okay, so I just have to add more at the name and stuff to it.
        - For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks.
        - So that's good. You thought through that. It wasn't a bad answer. It just wasn't correct for that question. 
        - is something you would use to find water on the moon.
        - Okay scientist, or I can see a better one.
        - Oh um that could be it. 
        - Um, yeah, I could try to see like
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct. 
        - Okay, Farrah and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely.
        - Yes, I know what you mean. They use the microscope to look closely at the water. 
        - Well, okay. So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in. So, that is correct. 
        - Really close. I'm sure you do. 
        - I think that might answer another question of how can they see the water.
        - I just think that I could see a little bit more room for improvement. So
        - So that's like, okay, you know, but I want your question your answer to be spectacular. 
        - Okay, so there is another tool in there.
        - They're looking for the water
        - I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden.
        - I think that is a great response, but I know that you could go even one step.
        - Oliver. That was really, really good. We're almost exactly where we want to be. We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there. But we're so close now. So thank you for your
        - wide range, you could have multiple answers like how Farrah said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes Chris.
        - Oh that is obviously a true statement. Right. You can't live without water. 
        -  and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research.
        - Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger.
        - You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water
        - Yeah, I think you're right. I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different
        - yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer.
        - Jazmin, you started off your response really well.
        - so Jazmin. Your answer was correct.
        - Okay, you want to have reread it
        - They do us all a lot of tools like that.
        - yeah well sort of about that I went to NASA so I know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Your answer is not wrong, but it's not totally right, either. 
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon. If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon. 
        - Okay. And that would be that would be correct. There's definitely no oxygen in space, 
        - You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. Um, so yeah, it makes sense that they would need other equipment too.
        - ya it's on my tablet
        - Okay, great. Okay, so let's reread over the text because Chris and Jazmin are really close to the answer.
        - yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call, but I wanted to say, thanks for asking asking everybody about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea, so you know I felt valued.
        - Well microscope is definitely equipment, but it's not used in space, like, because we
        - A better word?
        - Oh, okay, I need to look for that because I thought a microscope and that's pretty important.
        - Well, you're right. They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it.
        - But what I really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like I said when Luis we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe.
        - So Farrah. You're right. You need a scientific tool called the microscope. That's right. You're right. We also need
        - Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - So in essence. Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space. They need to breathe. Right.
        - All right, Farrah you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start
        - Right. Okay, good. So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it. 
        - Ok ok so
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there. Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence.
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope. 
        - Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Jazmin says that NASA sent a small machine. And that was right too. But that was not enough for that question. They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question.
        - And I think that with all of her answers. We're all getting on the right track.
        - Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points. Everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again.
        - Right. So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples. 
        - They did. And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like Luis said
        - Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time.
        - But I can do that.
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more. So if we put Jazmin's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer.
        - Actually I think it's partially right
        - Alright, so we've got the Lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment 
        - Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon.
        - I want to take a look even closer Farrah. There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified. But they didn't use that to specifically find the water. 
        - Okay, good. So that's a good start on your answer.
        - What I just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important, 
        - Yeah. Okay, that makes more sense. Okay.
        - Yeah, okay. So looking at your responses. I will say this, Jazmin. You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response. 
        - So Chris your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had.
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close.
        - No, no. So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet. So you're absolutely right. 
        - you're right Farrah when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right.
        - Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine. That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was.
        - So now we have two pieces of equipment right, so we have the Lunar orbiter that Jazmin talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response 
        - So again, that's true. I can tell you read part of the text. That's true. And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water.
        - So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so.
        - I'm I'm mostly focused. Well I guess. Yeah, I thought about discover just like Oliver I circled equipment and water.
        - I agree what Farrah.
        - OK, so the microscope. Is it wrong, but we've answered one part of the question. So now we want to. It says, what other what tools. So we found one tool. We want to find the other tool so microscope was correct, but we want to find the other tool also in our story. So even you had said.
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits.
        - Because yes, they would use all of that  but
        - Yes. And that is very true. They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for
        - Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect. 
        - Yeah, sure. Okay. And Luis you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks, 
        - That's a great place to start as and thank you. 
        - And Jazmin, you said NASA sense a small machine. Okay, and you know it you're actually correct. But
        - Um, yes. So, um,
        - Awesome. Okay. So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon. If it were astronauts on the moon. Right.
        - Okay, great so that's almost there I think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the Lunar orbiter and then, if we put that together with savannas answer.
        - And Chris, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water.
        - Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe. You're right.
        - Farrah you are um you are on the right track, you do mention the microscope 
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope.
        - Wow, that's a great start. Chris, so it does
        - um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better.
        - know your background knowledge is correct, but he's not the answer, or the way that I would have where did the answer.
        - Oh, yeah. So, okay, I should actually, I had a question, because I circled.
        - So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon 
        - One second Chris, I will get right back to you, and they use a microscope they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate, so there was a couple of different things, yes, Chris?
        - let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that, but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us.
        - Absolutely, absolutely. Those are some great observations. Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use. But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - That's not entirely true. But they did find water in some of those places. 
        - So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators. So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it. Jazmin, just something you'd like to add
        - There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so.
        - What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope.
        - Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question.
        - Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water.
        - um yeah well i'm still not totally sure, because I know me and Farrah we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small, how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya.
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead 
        - Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment.
        - So I was gonna say us with the machine was and I was gonna say the machine is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Your answer is not wrong, actually, but it could be even better. 
        - All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right
        - exactly right, and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because, by the way, that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon, however, the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze Chris what's up.
        - So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter. That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for.
        - Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin talked about to discover the water.
        - It is semi right. You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter.
        - yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that, like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one.
        - They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that. 
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment.
        - Yes. So that is one part of the one part of the answer. 
        - Oh OK.
        - Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there.
        - Okay, okay. Yeah.
        - will be super microscope and Jazmin set the Lunar orbiter.
        - mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a, we could get close, we could get an answer that's more specific right? Okay, so I wouldn't say it's wrong all right, I think you're on the right track for sure. Great job, Farrah. 
        - You did. You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks. 
        - So basically what I looked at what's up. Well, actually, I guess I didn't really circle. Well, no, I looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water.
        - And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,
        - So we need to, there's two parts of this answer. So we need to combine what Jazmin set. And her answer with what Farrah said in her answer, there's two parts.
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this. However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon. 
        - yeah I saw in paragraph two, there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon.
        - That is true, but it's not fully insured 
        - So you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water, but then, in order to see the water they use a microscope.
        - That NASA sent a small machine. It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space. Does that make sense?
        - That's good. They do need that. 
        - Sure. I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon. I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon. So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard.
        - If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment.
        - So Farrah. You are right, they, they set that small machine. And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        - Which is right, we all know, that's a known fact.
        - yeah exactly Okay, so what i'm hearing from you guys now is, we have two different tools that are really important in this 
        - We are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine, 
        - Can you tell me what equipment they use so Farrah and Oliver, you're not completely wrong. A microscope is a piece of equipment. But that's not the full answer.
        - um I also read that there could be a base on the moon by.
        - You're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon. But that's when they
        - When they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there.
        - So you were right in that it was a small machine. So great job. Jazmin,
        - So you both had part of the answer you said, to put it together.
        - Um, you know, I think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel , that I think it's convincing that they have, like, you know what they talk about with whay you can do, yeah I think it's convincing. 
        - I don't know. You know, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots
        - but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water
        - I can read the question if you want me to
        - But let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related I think you're all on a really good path, but we're not quite there yet.
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong. You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - um so well, I guess, I would change my answer to.
        - Was not with that microscope.
        - You do? Well Luis I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text.
        - so that the machine necessary is the Lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope So these are two parts of the answer to the question.
        - And the scientific tool. So I think you we're on the right track.
        - so Farrah you have one part and Jazmin had the other part, and we need to add it together.
        - They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading.
        - The microscope is a tool that they use. But I think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use.
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope. So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer. Um, so yeah, good job.
        - Luis had a good start on his too 
        - Oh, your answer is not wrong. They did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use.
        - Not completely wrong. It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - Not what they wear.
        - um I.
        - It's sort of right. They did send the machine. 
        - Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things. But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon
        - Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here.
        - but you didn't answer the question.
        - Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer. And we're going to dig deeper.
        - Okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter?
        - Alright, so Farrah as I was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water, because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer 
        - Okay Okay, I can add a couple more names of equipment.
        - They did need that. It was just like I was telling Luis. They use that, as well. Luis was right about that one. 
        - Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word. That's right. But we're going to look for one more thing. One more. Other key word in the question so Farrah. Could you tell me what word another word that you circled
        - Right, and then Farrah and Deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water. Do you remember reading that
        - You know, I think that, in combination with what everyone just said um is the best answer 
        - you're absolutely right, so, while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon.
        - So you are right on track to finding the right answer.
        - Okay. So your answer wasn't completely wrong. You did mention how NASA did send a small machine.
        - I would love for you to use the actual your, your answer was not completely wrong. 
        - Exactly there's a possibility that the Lunar that there's a Microscope on the Lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon.
        - Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon. So, good job. Yeah, yeah.
        - um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up, but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence.
        - Yeah. So what's your, your response. I'll read it to you. Was NASA send a small machine, which is true, NASA did send a small machine.
        - um your you, your answer was NASA sent a small machine. So you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment.
        - Also, sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong, but it's not answering the question that was asked. So we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it, and it's very true, but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked.
        - Wow. Yeah. You're exactly right. Water. We do use water to grow things. I'm not sure that that would work on the moon.
        - And that is very close and
        - So you are right, they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye.
        - So Farrah helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope. But we're still trying to figure out what other tool even. Do you have any audio.
        - Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct. And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question.
        - Well, that's very good. So the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right Farrah.
        - so, for example, and Luis the answer Luis was talking about using oxygen tanks and it's true that scientists use oxygen tanks, but they did not use oxygen tanks.
        - Yeah, and that's right, they do use that. 
        - I would say that you are almost there. Jazmin, I would say, because the question is very specific meaning what a piece of equipment. You said a small machine.
        - So you have one of the items we they needed to find water on the moon. Let's see if we can find the other item that I needed on the moon in the
        - Yeah, I think my answer is right, so I don't know why my answer is wrong.
        - Teacher : So you were almost there. Nice job. 
        - And that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Not exactly. But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage.
        - yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts, like the small machine when I began to investigate and I noticed ice deposits, but since they were so small, or to look at them, they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely.
        - So let's look at your answer. Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do.
        - You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is. 
        - And then Chris, we're going to look at your answer. And it was really great, and I think that you really understood the text, but I'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking. 
        - Acknowledges partial understanding as incomplete (e.g., "That's not quite right.")
        - Yeah, I just was going to say unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And in particular, I wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge. That was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already INAUDIBLE]. Thank you for letting us share.
        - So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe.
        - The lunar orbiter is another equipment on and then, as their fellow classmate also mentioned in her sentences shall be getting to sort of them said microscopes yeah.
        - you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon. That's what our passage told us.
        - No, it's not wrong. Okay. You just need to elaborate a little bit more. Okay.
        - Farrah and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon. And you guys are both on the right track. You guys are really thinking and I like where you're headed. 
        - You've got a piece of it. 
        - So you're on the right path. You just need a bit more. So, that makes sense.
        - Okay, so you would also use a microscope. So you're right you're both right that a microscope is a tool that scientists use to help them look closer at things. 
        - Oh that's all.
        - But let's find the paragraph and tech the scientists like sentence and where it corresponds, because the answer was not oxygen tanks and I didn't see that, from the paragraph, so your job is to find a paragraph
        -  Did they say, did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water. So yes, that is true that the water is so small you need a microscope. But that's not what's really being asked of us. 
        - That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope. 
        - yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why I have you guys answering any. 
        - even though I did like your answer. I think we can do even better job of answering the question.
        - We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you guys said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things
        - So we are halfway, 
        - Yes, you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small. 
        - Oh OK OK, I guess I mean what I like I read the whole thing and I looked for all the key words and I found I found that sentence with the key words in it.
        - Mm hmm. But what Miss Jazmin just read and what's advantages told us. It makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see. What do you guys think
        - One is kind of a version of the other slits. Think about it. 
        - Um. Okay, so the answer is, is it's called a lunar orbiter?
        - Well your answer is actually not wrong it's just half of the piece. So yours was more of the smaller picture 
        - Yes, yeah, those are other tools that scientists use.
        - but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge, so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon, but
        - Oh yeah but I mean also Jazmin because she said something different.
        - And but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important.
        - You are correct Farrah but not the answer is exactly looking for.
        - Part of it.
        - So, Jazmin. I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction. So I want everybody to look at the text.
        - So your answer wasn't wrong. I think you had a really great start to a response there. You said that NASA uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine. That's true. That's correct.
        - Chris scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That is absolutely true. And that's absolutely something that was in that reading
        - Right. Oh, I'm sure that's absolutely right. They to go up into space. We need tons of equipment that we don't use down here, right.
        - Yes, and that's great. That's a great answer. It is a small machine. That's what a microscope is. But the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph.
        - Our answers are a little bit just-they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations.
        - Well you're actually both right, so they use that machine called the Lunar orbiter to get to the moon, to investigate and see if there was ice.
        - Okay, yeah, you're right. So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space.
        - Absolutely. So your initial answer was correct. They need that water to be able to drink, be able to survive. 
        - Yes, they use all all of those are examples of equipment and just for this particular moment. 
        - so actually like that at this moment that's not exactly what the the object that they use is called 
        - You know I think you're I think you're right on track is there, if you look at the article, do you have the article with you.
        - Craters water on the moon, 
        - I think you're on the right track,
        - Okay, yeah, yeah.
        - Okay well after we asked the question, your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for. 
        - That that's not quite really answering the question, like, as we go on. 
        - Gotcha.
        - huh yeah so I just want to say you're right NASA did send a small machine, but I want to push you to expand your answer.
        - So I don't think that your answer so like I was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this group, I think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement.
        - so you weren't wrong I just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger.
        - I think you guys did a great job and you were on the right track.
        - So, you are correct. NASA does use all types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things. So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits
        - You talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the Lunar orbiter and Jazmin you talked about the Lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment, because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery.
        - Well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment. 
        - Okay, and they do use that and NASA and that is a good point. But I have a question.
        - and give you the same note that I gave Farrah, although the answer is correct, I think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to Oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is.
        - That's very knowledgeable of you point that out. 
        - Okay, I feel like I didn't see the word discovery.
        - So I think if we consider what Jazmin said, and we add what Farrah said, we might get a more complete picture of what scientists need to find water on the moon.
        - I part of what I think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope,
        -  But that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable.
        - That's a great question. You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right. When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water. Absolutely. 
        - That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?
        - Okay okay well that's it that is good that there's oxygen tanks, but to discover this water they're going to need more than oxygen tanks right probably going to need more.
        - In the polar craters. So you've got part of the answer, right?
        - I'm, I'm really sorry, but we have to go. I wanted to say before we go, thank you for really helping us understand the question. And the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was
        - So you both are on the right track here in the equipment. They're using a microscope to see the water.
        - Totally. Totally. And I completely understand that. So I love that you answered the question because your question is
        - because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for.
        - Your answer is a great start okay oh.
        - Your answer isn't wrong because It answers the question, but we want to see if there's maybe a better answer. Sometimes there's two answers and one of them's a little bit more specific.
        - Her perfect so Jazmin, you were absolutely on the right track.
        - So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks. I do think those would be helpful. But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water
        - yeah, so we are, microscope is part of that.
        - So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool. 
        - So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things.
        - Oh okay.
        - Okay, so that's that's part of an up. The answer is that we could have more space having more room. And let's see.
        - Well, they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space.
        - but they they weren't using the microscope to discover the water 
        - But it would, it wouldn't be the thing that found the water.
        - Then once they figured out that there was
        - um this is Oliver um I just I just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time.
        - Mhmm. Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer.
        - Well, there is a couple of answers.
        - Right so in the same way, like how I spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you guys just all had parts of the answer correct
        - Those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon. Okay.
        - Okay Luis Let's look at your answer. You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks. That is very true. You know, when they are in space. They need the oxygen to be able to breathe.
        - Yeah, it's really        - it is really important. 
        - You and Oliver
        - so Farrah and Oliver, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water.
        - And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question.
        - Okay, so you're saying.
        - So you said that NASA sent a small machine. And that is correct. The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water, 
        - that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right.
        - So, Jazmin. Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now. But what you have is a great start. 
        - No, I think you all helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time. It's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right.
        - Oh well, I just wanted to say, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - All right, but you're definitely on the right.
        - Okay, so they did find
        - And Chris, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon. They did. In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water.
        - so I would kind of pair you a little bit more with Jazmin saying you're on the right track.
        - That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing.
        - I don't think that we could. Um, I don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon. 
        - Yeah, yeah, I remember reading, paragraph three, but I didn't think that um that that was it. Because, because they said that they were talking about finding the water and I had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters.
        - But you were missing step number one. So, Jazmin did a great job of explaining. Step number one and you did a great job of explaining. Step number two. But now we need to put it all together.
        - Right yeah the orbiter.
        - Yes. So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. 
        - If I had to say. Your question was wrong. Your question was right or your question was spectacular a plus. I'm going to say your question was right.
        - Chris, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon. Okay, they did find craters with water.
        - You are getting to the right answer.
        - Well, it was right. You had one thing, but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right. We just had a fun one more tool.
        - Okay, so it's possible that it's one of those two pieces of equipment they, thank you for sharing your thinking.
        - Okay, so we're getting there. 
        - That's right. Luis So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you. You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me
        - They absolutely do. Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking. 
        - Okay, so looking at those. Yes, you wouldn't need those for space exploration
        - Yes, small, but it's actually smaller than small, microscopic is a really big word that means very, very small, small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool.
        - Um, I think that we can do even better. I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response. So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Thank you for that answer Oliver. Yes. So they used a lunar orbiter to discover the water and then they used a microscope in order to be able to see it closer, since it was so small.
        - So let's think about this. Do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water?
        - As I said, everyone else, your answer is correct, but it's not exactly the answer I was looking for.
        - That's absolutely right, but we're only Halfway right it's as if we have, you know, we're, we got a foot in the door. But we got to get the rest of the way in. 
        - Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use. 
        - OK. So the scientists, they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them.
        - Okay, so that is a really good thing to bring up Oliveron. I appreciate that. So again, your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text. So you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end. Right.
        - Well enough. That's right. The astronauts use all that you are correct in that, 
        - That there was water on the moon.
        - yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because I mean I picked the small machine and and I understand also microscope is in there, but I don't think I would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am I wrong if I don't say that?
        - Not necessarily. 
        - Well, it's part. It's part of the answer 
        - So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon. And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, Oliver.
- intent: r130.2
  examples: |
        - let's see if Farrah has anything different to say 
        - Yes, that's a very good point as well. Chris and can someone remind me do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon. Does anyone remember?
        - Well, to find the water NASA send a small machine.
        - So what I'm going to ask you all to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner. And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers. So you're going to share each other's answers.
        - Well, me and depth kind of set the same stuff. We said that you know the Microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four, they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to
        - Maybe
        - So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates. Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can
        - Do you agree with her thinking? Do you disagree with her thinking? why oh
        - I would agree. What do you all think? Do you think that that strengthens Jazmin's answer?
        - Okay that's a great question. Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to Farrahs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter. Okay Luis What do you think?
        - I said that that's the scientists NASA center small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Did anybody else use a strategy, similar to Jazmin or differently to Jazmin, and how did it help them or how did it? Yeah. How did that help them to do this work, Oliver?
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, Luis, and I appreciate your feedback. But what was the microscope attached to? Help Farrah out.
        - I was pretty good. let me see you're sad. you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel. you said breathing.
        - Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore.
        - I mean, I think it might be cool to go to space. But I feel like if we make it too easy to go to space. And that'll make it too easy for everybody on earth to just, you know, like
        - We also use it in science class to
        -  Okay, so does anyone else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now, what do I think after the conversation?
        - Yeah, for, for me, that's why I was I was confused because I was looking for water in the story. And so I didn't see the pardon about paragraph two, about the ice cuz I was looking for the word water.
        - Farrah, is it okay if Jazmin helps you out this question?
        - I think, oh,
        - Um yeah I I thought water was the important word
        - Oh, I think it takes, can someone find it?
        - uh huh
        - Um, so I guess like I kind of know a lot about NASA and I know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so I don't know. I think that Oliver's guess is pretty good. Like you could look and say, like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit?
        -  Does anyone else have an answer that they would like to contribute?
        - and Farrah, you can help out too.
        - Maybe someone else could offer something. yeah Jazmin.
        - yeah great, Chris. Luis do you have any thoughts? I know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic. do you have any comments to share on top of the Chris, because you can add on to this.
        - Do we agree with her answer.
        - Evidence. Thank you. Does anybody agree with Jazmin about evidence or does somebody have a different idea?
        - Okay, so, you know, initially, that's what I thought, too.
        - Okay well, that's great. why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards? okay.
        - I picked out equipment and discover too.
        - Does anyone agree or disagree with Oliver?
        - Um, I can do it. I can do it. I'm
        - yeah, I guess, so I I think like I read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know, like I don't know like It made me think that this is something that could make that possible.
        - That Luis didn't say, how about Farrah? What did. What did what equipment and I use?
        - um Chris, you have your hand raised earlier, do you want to maybe add on to what Farrah and Oliver have shared so far?
        - yeah I do.
        - No does anyone can answer the how much water they found.
        - Did you all hear what I said to Luis?
        - So I believe they use the microscope because you, you said that we should look at the text. So why I believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see, and then the text. It's like saying that the waters microscopic so like I think that's it.
        - Okay. Jazmin and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer. I would like for the four of you, and Luis can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with.
        - Chris and you want to build on that?
        - Very good, very good. Um, so can you go, or can you turn and asked help from a friend.
        - Does anybody want to add some more detail. Oliver, thank you for raising your hand.
        - Oh, it must be. It must be Farrah.
        - So, Farrah and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then Luis You can you can talk with me.
        - Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?
        - It means to go around.
        - Yes, had to be from the craters, the craters for the water
        - Okay, so I'm like, here's the thing. I basically like my dad took me to NASA. And when we went to NASA. We went and saw like all of this, like, um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like Luis was talking about. 
        - Oliver you started out the same answer as Farrah, do you agree with what you said you want to add on?
        - Anybody else find any other piece of equipment.
        - Does the rest talk with Luis about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter. I think you have the answer. So, talk with Luis and help him discover which one it is.
        - Okay, we can do that.
        - And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates all right.
        - Well, what do other people think does anyone else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope Is it the Lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah Chris.
        - Okay, so equipment and discover did anyone else underlying equipment.
        - Perfect. Awesome. How about Oliver and Farrah. You guys look at that together. Okay.
        - I had an idea. But I don't remember--
        - I want        - before we get into that I want anyone else to share any other equipment they may have circled.
        - and let's see class. Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement. They found craters full of water on the moon.
        - And then Jazmin. How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out Chris and Luis to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right.
        - yeah does anybody know when they use it, based on the text we can look in part three.
        - And then, as a group, we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote, you can vote amongst each other, what do you think the correct answer is, and, as a group, you can decide, and let me know.
        - Discover
        - yeah that's fair does anybody have have some input for Oliver as to why the small machine is also important Luis.
        - Think about what's Farrah said.
        - Yeah yeah cuz that that was the same. I had circle too Oliver. I had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Because they were looking at the water. And that's what the question is asking.
        - On not not about this, no, I was gonna say that I was gonna say I asked my new answer is ok
        - Does anyone agree with Farrah. If you agree can raise your hand. And if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text 
        - So how to do that Jazmin either you can answer, or maybe Chris or Luis could help you out with that.
        - that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did anyone else have any other ideas.
        - Who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and I think Oliver you also answered the same as Farrah, so why don't you the three Farrah, Oliver and Chris have a quick chat with each other.
        - Well, I think you're thinking could benefit everybody else and how you just does everybody. Does anybody else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right.
        - Does anybody remember?
        - I wonder, maybe Oliver can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer.
        -  can anybody or Farrah. Can you tell me
        - Um, yeah. Yeah, that'd be great because you know if I have to carry water might my arms and be tired.
        - Oh well, Okay, I said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Oliver and Farrah can the three of you chat for a minute and share, about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then Jazmin and Luis can you do that as well.
        - Group members, while the first person is sharing
        - Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with Farrah.
        - Okay Luis are you able to help?
        - that's that's really good answer, I agree with Chris about that, but I just I just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch, right now, but I really wanted to say, we really appreciate how you really took your time and.
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead Farrah.
        - Yeah, I got this. It's called
        - Is there anything else they'd need to find that water.
        - Oh, okay. So, based on what Luis just read about a lunar orbiter.
        - Does anyone else have any other ideas about what equipment is.
        - Awesome. What about Jazmin, what do you think about that.
        - Oliver, you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now.
        - Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for Luis?
        - So did anybody say like a title?
        - Is it the one that I said that we were just talking about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - While I was just gonna say like, I know that like scientists use a lot of, you know, equipment, so like I said oxygen tanks and stuff like that.
        - Good good Farrah you want to build off that.
        - Does anyone have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment. Yeah, Farrah. Go ahead.
        - Yeah. So basically, um, I think that, well, it sounds like the microscope like
        - who can raise their hand and what isn't it. 
        - Well, I mean that's The only other equipment that they have in the story is the Lunar orbiter.
        - Chris. Do you want to answer. Luis's question.
        - About Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people.
        - Yes, I see.
        - Okay, Jazmin. Do you agree. Also, do you have something else to say.
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from Farrah, and why you found what you found. And then why your elbow partner agrees with you.
        - Oh, OK. I can see why you think that, but I don't see it that way. Does anyone else have an idea, why do we all have different answers.
        - Awesome. Does anyone else have a different response than Jazmin.
        - I know that food is pretty gross I want to bring you into Congress and you should with Chris because Chris raised a good point in his
        - and at the same time I want, i'm wondering, is there any one else have different answers?
        - Yeah, so I went to NASA. And I saw that the scientists, they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that.
        - Or anyone else find anything different?
        - And then eighth and you can share your answer with me. I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that.
        - Right good good anyone have a different answer.
        - So do you guys agree that that can be very valuable.
        - So what do you think about this Oliver
        - Farrah, would you agree with what Oliver said?
        - Oh well.
        - Does anybody want to-        - Luis, do you want some help from a friend?
        - Yes. So investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth.
        - About Jazmin can you read yours, and then we can maybe like a grief, we wanted to add something to it, or maybe take something away Okay, so I.
        - Alright, so what I would like us to do next is Oliver Farrah and Luis I would like to group with you together and Chris and Jazmin, we're gonna work together. Okay.
        - nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used. Does that make sense.
        - And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes.
        - Oh yeah I saw that one.
        - Okay. Well, I guess I gotta look in paragraph two
        - Luis What do you think, do you agree with death.
        - This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes Oliver.
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water.  You can drink it and do other stuff, right?
        - Um, now I mean, maybe they used it, but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it. But, um, I think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important. Okay.
        - and actually Chris had a good point and his answer Chris, if you want to share.
        - OK Can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and NASA use.
        - So who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist.
        - Um, yeah.
        - Luis, Do you want to try to help her out to
        - Now, now you guys have not, but you guys were so close. So have Mr Chris and history. Luis out death.
        - Well i mean i i support. What's the microscope. Cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story.
        - they didn't?
        - Um, okay. So basically, my thinking.
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together. Let's work together to see if we can find this answer. Okay.
        - or actually Farrah um, do you agree with Luis that.
        - Jazmin and Luis I want you to partner up and do the same and Chris, you and I are going to spend some time together and be partners for today 
        - What do you think about that, Oliver?
        - Um okay so
        - You agree with that.
        - Ok, all, what do you see.
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out.
        - So i'm Farrah do you want to talk first.
        - Can anyone help him? 
        - Would anybody else like to add on Oliver Chris or Luis to the first question.
        - What does everyone else think.
        - um yeah I mean I kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that I noticed was that.
        - Okay, so like I don't really think that it's the microscope. I think that it's the machine. The Lunar Orbiter. And the reason that I think that is that it, it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question, like discover, what it does.
        - What does everyone else think do they agree with what Oliver said.
        - Does anyone remember.
        - awesome why don't you talk with Jazmin and you guys can figure out if that.
        - Okay, so let's continue to look maybe Jazmin can help you out. 
        - Still don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - How about Farrah and Oliver show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well. Okay.
        - do you agree with Farrah do you want to add anything or take anything away from it all.
        - um yes, I I thought, something different, so I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        -  what else how are they traveling to the moon.
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think Farrah. What might help your friend.
        - I circled two. I circled small machine and Lunar Orbiter.
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - Debbie will be the second Chris, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer. So, Farrah, if you will go first. And then, Oliver. I'll tell you when when to start
        - My answer was.
        - Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for
        - Yeah, I would have to say, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and Oliver work together since you were you had the same answer. 
        - I think so um let me see.
        - By using what you and Mr Chris and Mr Chris, you can talk to. Luis and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts.
        - Chris, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used.
        - Awesome. So you're going to share what you found with Chris and I'm going to work with Oliver independently, Luis you have a question. Okay.
        - Okay equipment for discovering water.
        - Yeah, I do.
        - Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um,
        - Yeah, um
        - Um sure. Um, I actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon, but it seems like that answers not right. I'm a little confused about why
        - Does anybody want to help Luis out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?
        - um, what do you, what do you all think.
        -  but Jazmin what else, are you going to add?
        - Perfect, yeah. And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover
        - together.
        - Jazmin I think you talked about a small machine, do you want to add anything here.
        - So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question.
        - um yeah well now that I understand um yeah uh yeah I do.
        - What could, Can somebody help Jazmin.
        - They said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - All right. Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is everybody else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words.
        - All right does anybody else have any other ideas about tools that NASA might have used.
        - Thank you Jazmin for sharing your thought processes. Let's see Chris, I haven't heard from you today. Do you agree with Jazmin that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate?
        - What I said was, it, it was a small machine.
        - Absolutely Chris, do you want to clarify that.
        - Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and Farrah and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope. I want you guys to look back at your reading passage
        - Does anyone have a different feeling about that answer, do you think the Jazmin has included everything she needs to she talked about the WHO or anything else Farrah?
        - So, Farrah and Deb, you can work together. Chris and gel together and Luis You can work with me. Okay, so take a couple seconds.
        - Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you guys got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about
        -  What else do you think are important tools that allow them to look at water.
        - did anyone else identify that as a tool in this paragraph.
        - Chris, do you want to jump in? How about Farrah and Oliver? What's it asking for, it's asking for equipment for discovering water, what else is it asking for.
        - I want you guys to break up into small groups so Farrah Oliver and Chris and then maybe Jazmin and Luis If you guys will work together for just a little bit. And if you have questions while you're discussing. You can ask me, but this is what I want you guys to focus on
        - I have a different answer, but I think that they they did use it to look closely at the water.
        - Do you want to add Jazmin, what was the equipment that you had said that may be Luis's thinking about?
        - Right. Did anybody else see anything else in the text that you might use. So we have a microscope. Jazmin?
        - I wasn't really answering the question, so I ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter.
        - That is absolutely correct. Good job. Jazmin. Okay. I want you guys to give me. Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree. A thumbs in the middle. If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree with Jazmin. Can you guys do that.
        - um I I I didn't oh okay well i'm My answer is oxygen tanks, I said oxygen tanks.
        - So, if we take a step further, to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph? Jazmin.
        - Do we agree or disagree with Chris. Why, raise your hand.
        - Well, let me, let me ask Jazmin, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine. What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help Chris with that one. 
        - Yes. Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out Luis?
        - I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question.
        - Um, he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship.
        - Does anyone did anyone else find other examples, Farrah.
        - Well. I know, I know a lot about space like and I know a lot about the moon. Like, I know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and
        - Well, your answer is not wrong Oliver and i'm so i'm so glad that you picked to the microscope so I let as a way to answer your question, I would like one of your classmates to maybe kind of give us kind of a reassessment of how was it that that NASA made this discovery.
        - Exactly. So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space. Does anybody remember the name of that piece of equipment.
        - um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other. 
        - Yeah, sure. Okay. The question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  like how you define what it is microscopic... would you want to think deeply about that or maybe. Talk to Dave about it in the meanwhile Jazmin can answer because chip, it seems like Dave also so called the same thing as us 
        - Attempts to correct by involving other students to support (e.g., "Does anyone want to explain…?")
        - Chris. Do you agree with Jazmin.
        - wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water.
        - Does anybody have any other ideas about what equipment, the scientists use? do we.. Farrah yes?
        - Well, maybe. Maybe both.
        - let's see if we can reset refine your answer further.
        - So I think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it. So I'm not really sure like why is my answer, like um not right.
        - What did you say Chris. Do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well.
        - Oh well, the craters they're dark.
        - Anybody can answer.
        - Well, I put in my answer that NASA sent a small machine. I don't know why my answer is wrong.
        - I said equipment discover and water.
        - I wasn't in my answer, but I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.
        - I think so. Who agrees with Jazmin who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use
        - Very good. That's a claim that Luis said, right Luis?
        - Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and Oliver, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah. So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?
        - And you can talk about it. And I'm going to speak with Chris for a moment. Okay.
        - Okay um So the first one that I see is the small machine.
        - awesome awesome okay Farrah and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks.
        - Well, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Well, yeah. So I was trying to figure out, like, was I guess I don't understand why my, my answer was wrong because like was the microscope. Did they use the microscope, because it seems like they did use the microscope.
        -  and it doesn't have to be Jazmin somebody else can help her out if you want just find the line in the text that says that NASA sent a small machine.
        - So I want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with Farrah and Oliver. And then Chris Jazmin Luis are going to work together, and I want you to compare and contrast the difference between the Lunar orbiter and microscope.
        - All right, so Farrah and deb why don't you guys work together, while I finish up with everyone else, and you guys can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence, yes Jazmin.
        - yeah in the story was there a part that maybe some one of your peers can help you find it.
        - um no actually okay I don't know that one. I don't know what that one is.
        - i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now, I just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you. So I want you to collaborate with them, okay? Thank you for the question. 
        - Some of them, yeah. 
        - I want you to do this with a with a small group. So Farrah and Oliver can do it together and Chris Jazmin Luis can also be a small group, and I want you to circle any equipment, you see, in the reading, that you think is important, and then I want you come back in one minute.
        - To someone want to try to put that into one answer.
        - All right. And once you're done, you can share with the partner, partner next to you.
        - That is a very good question to anyone. Anybody wants to help him out and answer. Why would they put a microscope, along with the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Well, we are absolutely on the right track. Jazmin, what do you have to add?
        - Equipment. Good. I'm just gonna pull everybody in the class and see if we're on the same page. Or if someone else wants to tell me something different. Oliver, go ahead. 
        - Okay, well, so I know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use, and I know that there isn't gravity, but I actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before, so this is news to me. 
        - For the next for the next person who answers.
        - So yeah, I wasn't sure how to make my answer better
        - What do people think. Do people think that
        - Oh, oh circle evidence in the text.
        - Anybody else?
        - You guys have until six o'clock to work with your partner.
        - yeah so So what does everyone else think what do we think the Lunar orbiter is doing.
        - Actually Farrah and Luis I think we're going to work together. Luis Are you are you with me.
        - Yeah, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - So now we know they have. Oliver you remember what I tools the scientist used?
        - Okay, so let's speaking of waters heavy. Let's go to Chris's answer okay there's you said water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it. 
        - Yes, Chris
        - OK. Farrah, what do you think?
        - What do we think folks?
        - So what other kinds of equipment would you guys say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope.
        - Reach Every reader: Oh I just got the same thing 
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text. 
        - I had microscope.
        - Basically, what I thought is its a small machine.
        - Luis our space expert Can you help us out.
        - anyone else were you able to see even from hearing what Luis shared and even from going back into the passage, we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the.
        - So unfortunately, we have to go to our next class, we go to our next class. I just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today.
        - Does anyone has some different ideas to add them.
        - And while I talked to some of the others. Maybe we'll discover it together. What do you think
        - Yeah, I'm Chris, you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel. 
        - cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page So then, and then, did you have a similar answers to Jazmin or something different.
        - Okay, so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today, but I would in the in the meanwhile, I just want you to listen to why Chris and Jazmin have made some differences to the benefits of this.
        - Okay, so go ahead and get started. And then I'm going to go to each of you individually.
        - yeah um my answer is NASA sent a small machine.
        - Luis Would you like to help Chris. Oh.
        - Does anybody in the group remember reading about what they use to find the craters.
        - I had a really good answer um well I I brought you guys, all together, because you guys all had varying answers so i'm hoping that when you guys hear your responses like your classmates responses.
        - Oh, so it's Chris and so I don't know.
        - did anybody find a different word than equipment in question one.
        - Do you thin they used the microscope. Do you think that they used the lunar orbiter? Why or why not?
        - So you're saying you're saying it's the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope.
        - You learn the word orbit and Farrah. What did Chris, say, what does it mean
        - It looks for, um I was gonna say the same thing, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um.
        - Somebody help Chris out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text. What's another keyword somebody else found
        - yeah cuz in paragraph six, they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet.
        - All right, who agrees with Jazmin or Chris, do you have something to say.
        - How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer 
        - After that, okay, so you'll share with the group Farrah.
        - Does anyone have more to add on to this question.
        - It was lunar orbiter
        - Oh, yeah. So I think that he's right about equipment. But I don't think that like I don't think he was I don't think he was reading, ma'am. I think she was just saying stuff like that he knew, like I looked at it and I said like I think it's a microscope.
        - Was um was a microscope attached to, like, to the astronaut?
        - that's a very good observation would anyone else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what Oliver just said?
        - Yeah. Oliver, can you help us out a little bit? I see you raising your hand.
        - Um, to kind of build off that Oliver. Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here.
        - Did anybody get a different answer from Luis. Um, Farrah, what did Oliver. What do you get
        - um to make this a little easier did anybody have any answers that were different from savannas.
        - Yeah, so I picked a different piece of equipment and Jazmin picked
        - Jazmin and Chris work together.
        - See if you can look in your text and you and Oliver can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too. yes Chris.
        - mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if anyone can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission, other than a microscope that we just heard Oliver and Farrah talk about a little bit yeah Jazmin.
        - Would anyone else like to build on his response.
        - And so I found my answer and part three, I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also.
        - And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use
        - so Oliver is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and, if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add.
        - Does anybody want to help Farrah make answer stronger.
        - Yes. Does anybody else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts.
        - or yeah yeah okay great does anyone else, want to add anything, maybe Jazmin or Chris.
        - See if you guys got the same answers.
        - Your said to Luis that he has to restate the question and an answer the question.
        -  So looking at the reading There's another machine that the scientists use did anyone remember what that other machine that they used
        - So you have like a quick moment to have a chat with each other and then share like Maybe you can reach a conclusion about the quantity of the water on the moon.
        - Did anyone want to add anything to that I can. I still see a hand Chris.
        - Okay, well let's see what Chris and Luis thought as well.
        - Alright and Chris. Can you tell me the other item that they needed
        - I answered craters full of water. But you said craters wasn't equipment. I know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters. So I would think a lot of water.
        - Equipment. All right. Did anyone circle anything different.
        - yeah so thank you did anyone else circle equipment also.
        - Um, yeah, I guess I was thinking like, Well, let's see. What was I gonna say... I was gonna say that, well, I guess what I found was that water can be broken down into two parts. So hydrogen and oxygen. So I guess I was going to say that, like, yeah, that's stuff that also is useful.
        - Um, well, okay, I'm Jazmin, she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence. And I think I did something similar, but I actually came up with a different opinion. So I think part of part of the question was having an opinion.
        - Okay, so, so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that I should not breathe oxygen. And that's important.
        - Luis what did you get
        - so let's build on that, how can we build on that a little bit more?
        - As we were talking, did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too? Does that sound familiar.
        - Maybe let's come back to Luis. Luis we haven't heard from you, since the beginning.
        - Jazmin add on.
        - So, Jazmin. Your answer was that NASA send a small machine. So Chris, do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes?
        - Yeah I circled the same one.
        - now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said, and we can come to the closest answer so Jazmin, can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer.
        - Okay so Luis You know a lot about space. Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?
        - Okay everyone, Oliver. What do you think, do you agree with Farrah or no.
        - Um, yeah, I think it could be, um, I just feel like also like for me. Like, I went to NASA. And I know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space.
        - Okay, so you still think that that anyone else that has everyone else's opinion stayed the same, or have they changed.
        - Okay well i'm going to toss it back to the team is her answer wrong, and if it is explained why with evidence from the text.
        - Would anybody like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is
        - So  what does everyone else think, do you guys agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed In order to discover water on the moon, or do you disagree and might think it's something else?
        -  They sent the small machine.
        - Farrah can you help Jazmin out?
        - yeah So what does everyone else think do we agree with what Farrah and Oliver said, do we have a different answer what does everyone think.
        - Well, I know I didn't have equipment in my answer, so I had to add that, um but for Farrah's answer I guess she is saying the equipments.
        - And the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first, and I want you to share with your partner, the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text, this time around, and if it changed tell your partner, why all right go.
        - In that paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, so this paragraph, it tells us.
        -  um what else could they have used, I think that somebody else yes Jazmin.
        - You got it Oliver are you are you on board with that.
        - Does anyone want to jump in? 
        - um yeah so my answer was that NASA Center small machine head, so I don't understand why my answers room.
        - Does anybody have any ideas, Jazmin.
        -  um well i'm not sure I think my first answer is right, but um I know it doesn't say equipment, but I don't really know what the equipment is I just listened to Jazmin.
        - Thank you for sharing back does anyone have a different answer than Luis.
        - Oliver in Luis then work together.
        - So, can you help us move our thinking forward what is something Chris to do to confirm his thinking.
        - out while i'm and not so much about the moon base, but I was thinking about what Farrah was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying Jazmin to answer was right, the Lunar orbiter.
        - so could anyone tell me what is the action in this question.
        - Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that.
        - Chris. What did the scientists, fine.
        - Okay, so Chris, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?
        - mm hmm so let's let's let's ask the rest of the group
        - Well, I mean, in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters. So I don't think I'm wrong, either.
        - But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article. So, do you know what paragraph or. Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in Oliver
        - That's okay. Can anyone help him.
        - full of water, would you like to discuss this statement, whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect?
        - So does anybody else see any other equipment. Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to
        - um no she didn't have the WHO and.
        - Well, actually, I thought that it was water. What equipment to find water on the moon.
        - want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use Chris.
        - Okay, thank you for giving your answer. I'm sorry to just call on you out of the blue, but, um, I think it's important to get everyone's input, so we can all be on the same page. Chris, what you think.
        - So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi
        - I just need to write something down.
        -   So what investigate mean does anybody know. Farrah.
        - Yeah, I actually did get a different answer because I was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope. I feel like you know, like, that was really the equipment that they use to find the water.
        - Um, yeah. No, I agree, and I think that makes sense to me.
        - Um, yeah. So what I was thinking. Just like on the question that you're asking is, like, you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it. You can detect water using other tools.
        - Okay, can you give me just one, second, while I talked to Oliver and Farrah maybe you and Luis can talk about why you chose your answers and what you think is different between your answers.
        - Luis gave an example, Oliver, do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts.
        - Do you agree or disagree.
        - It sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel. 
        - Really smaller exactly.  Did anybody else think that while they're reading or see that in the text? Oliver?
        - Now Chris, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon.
        - So maybe Chris and Jazmin. If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three. I think that may help if you reread that okay.
        - Does anyone else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text.
        - So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon. So you think that you could work with Luis? 
        - can do you think you could answer Oliver's question? How would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon.
        - You are just listening to them. So we're going to start with Farrah, you will be our first person to share
        - Jazmin, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with Chris, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry. Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?
        - Based on what evidence, you have been able to collect Is there anyone else would like to add to the response that Jazmin has made.
        - Does that shift anyone else's thinking about their response to here Oliver explaining where he found that in the text?
        -  Okay um my answer didn't change, it's still microscope and I circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph.
        - Does anybody want to help Chris. Oh.
        - Good. So, Farrah. So what did Chris, you say about the water
        - awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay, so I saw in the first paragraph, where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters. Um, but then I remembered that you told Farrah that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now I'm not really sure, you know.
        - Yes, yes.
        - Yes, I had a different answer.
        - Luis What else is to say that oxygen, hydrogen could be used as
        - You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way. Does anyone else have any questions before we begin?
        - Does anyone know
        - Okay, now that you have circled your keywords. I would like for you to turn to the person beside you. So, Farrah and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and Jazmin, you can talk
        - Well, so for my answer, I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but it doesn't new equipment and my answer, but that's how I answered the question.
        - Um, what do you guys think about what Farrah said
        - Farrah?
        - Does anyone remember what it's called.
        - A lunar orbiter. Does anybody think that lunar orbiter might be the right answer or might be the piece of equipment that was needed in order to find the water on the moon? 
        - Oliver and Jazmin should be working together.
        -  um yeah well, I just wanted to say um I think I got this all figured out so I'm good.
        - So to wrap this all up. It's important that we're on the same page. And we use the information we we went back and discovered
        - So you and Jazmin you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out. 
        - Oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing.
        - Okay um I think I didn't even think about that second paragraph because of I was looking for water.
        - Um, well, I think, yeah, like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff. So Luis, then you should just like even I mean you should just share with us what you think like your background.
        - Good. I like that, too. I like that. We can have different answers. So, so we'll consider water as well and Jazmin, what do you have
        - Can somebody help
        - Anything else that we have.
        - so um did anyone have a different answer from Jazmin, 
        - is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource Farrah.
        - So right now I want Chris deaf and Farrah to turn and talk to your partner and Jazmin and Luis will turn and talk with each other and you're going to answer does your response connect to the context of the question, go ahead and do that for 10 seconds.
        - Scientists use the microscope to discover water. Do people think it was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah, that's what I was gonna say that was, that was the answer that I sent for the question.
        - Oliver could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon, is still too early for Chris's goals.
        - and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right 
        - Oh yeah, I had also picked equipment, actually. So
        - So what I want to do now is split you guys into two small groups so i'm just going to do Chris and death.
        - Um, I want us to go back in and answer our question again. So does anyone have another example that we could use of
        - Let me see who else I.
        - So let's say Farrah, if you are working with Chris. You two would share your answers with each other.
        - I guess I don't know. I don't know if-        - I think NASA has a lot of money. So I guess I figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money. But I don't know if it's worth it.
        - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I always like to talk. So I basically um yeah so what I was looking at when I was looking at the reading was I basically was saying. Like I said equipment too. And then I said, like
        - Let me see Does anyone want to help her out or point to where it was in the article.
        - I don't understand I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - yeahm did anyone else find something else that they thought was interesting.
        - so let's see who can add to that.
        - let's see Luis did you have anything different today.
        - All right, very good. So I want you to talk to each other in your groups and I'm going to ask Chris Jazmin and Luis to be in one group and Oliver and Farrah, 
        - So, Farrah, and Oliver, how about you two work together and talking to each other.
        - Farrah, can you help him out there?
        - Oh, we know this, I know this. .
        - So let me see. Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together.
        - Well, I was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Oliver. Did you circle, those two words.
        - Oh sure yeah I could do that.
        - . And then Chris was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah, in paragraph three, the last one, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - does anyone can anyone summarize what those two machines were Oliver, I think you just had it would anyone else, like to build on that.
        - You had equipment and anyone else in the group have equipment.
        - Yeah, I am. I thought that I thought the same thing I Farrah. So I, I was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water
        - Um yeah.
        - Luis What do you think
        - Also, yes, you are so right can anybody help right what is that machine call that NASA.
        - To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, Luis Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you.
        - Oliver, let's have everyone look first before you share. Anyone besides-        - anyone else? Chris, what did you come up with?
        - Oh yeah I agree, but i'm also um I don't really know how I would have figured that out if Chris hadn't told us about the suits and things, how would I have figured that out just on my own.
        - Thank you Oliver for sharing your thought process. Do other students in the class agree, disagree, want to push back? Feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard.
        - Great. So you could say they discovered the water, let's bring this to a consensus, I think only have like 30 seconds or a minute left.
        - did anybody else have a different tool that the scientists used?
        - What do you guys think. What do you guys think the answer is, then
        - Yeah so convincing is an important word. And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one. Also convincing. What is it convincing. Convincing what? what are we being convinced of. Does anybody have a word to go along with savannas word convincing.
        - The machine, the microscope?
        - Can we, can someone remind me of that.
        - Um, yeah. So I guess they used the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter. Is that right?
        - Oh yeah definitely well, the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too.
        - I'm sorry, that was Luis, I should have raised my hand.
        - Jazmin is there anything else you would want to add to Luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question?
        - wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon, they need landing gear um suits and masks, Chris already said that, food, really gross food for them to eat on the trip um.
        -  So just paragraph four or five and six. Okay. So, Oliveron Farrah. You guys and Chris can work together and Jazmin and Luis You can work together.
        - We're not entirely there just yet. Oliver, what you got to add?
        - Farrah, do you agree with that.
        - Equipment.
        - You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud.
        - um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer, so I found a little more, and I would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate.
        -  so did anyone else circle discover.
        - And so let's hear from Luis and see what he has to say. And we'll come together with a group response. Okay.
        - So, Farrah, can you add to that.
        - So if you are going to revise your answer. It may help Chris and Luis to understand better.
        - So then Luis Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon.
        - and if you finish before I come back to you. Go ahead and work on the next question.
        - said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water.
        - Okay, that's one type of equipment anyone else know about another type of equipment.
        - Chris. What do you think, do you agree with Farrah endeavor. Do you agree with Jazmin and Luis Why
        - What do astronauts use it for Jazmin.
        - You can get ideas for them as well, because even the smartest people in the world, work with other people to make things better, because if you can collaborate, then you guys all learn at the same time.
        - Anybody else have a different answer. So we're, we're, we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right
        - Okay, that's a really good thought. Farrah. I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what everyone thinks about your key terms. Okay. Jazmin, would you like to go next.
        - Okay, can you help them out. You guys, what part in
        - Maybe someone else can offer something.
        - Well it's kind of wondering that because I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how.
        - Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch. I know it was a really short time, but I do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer.
        - I don't know either if the moon is wet or dry.
        - Yes. Do you all agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy.
        - And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group. So if you got the right answer. The Lunar Orbiter. What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you.
        - Okay. Thumbs up if you agree with Farrah thumbs down. If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer.
        - Well Okay, so I do think it's used to look at the water on the moon, but I guess, I had a different answer so i'm not sure either um.
        - So for the remainder of class we're going to break apart into groups or into part with you. We're going to break apart.
        - I want you guys to talk about with that same partner, 
        - Okay. So eventually I think should go along with what Oliver said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that 
        - But except for this Equipment. Can you, can somebody share what is another word that you found that is also important in the question.
        - So. Mm hmm. If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr Chris that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for
        - Does anybody else have any ideas about tools?
        - So...
        - so maybe as we keep listening, as you heard from Jazmin and we might hear from Oliveron Farrah.
        - drink this water does anyone else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing.
        - Well let's look who knows what a lunar Luis do you know what a lunar orbiter is?
        - So as you're working. I'm going to go to each group individually, and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit
        - That's a good idea. No thought, Luis, did you wanna chime in on anything. I know.
        - does anyone have any other ideas on where we might.
        - I think the equipment was a microscope.
        - Does anybody want to help out Luis and tell him what the lunar orbiter was
        - Can someone rephrase what Luis just said, what does the Lunar lunar orbiter do.
        - Um well, I mean it helps to know a lot about space, like me and I guess Chris he kind of knows a lot about space too. 
        - The scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at  At the finding water on the moon, is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text, and when you answer I want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer.
        - Think so. No. Okay. Does anyone else want to say something real quick.
        - does anyone can anyone else, help and let us know what different form water might be in on the moon, rather than liquid like it like we might expect okay how about.
        - I mean, I guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon, you know, I guess. I mean, I'd probably want to have video games or something up there, I think.
        - What do you think, Jazmin, what do you feel about what Luis said?
        - Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses. But we're still missing the point. Jazmin. I'm calling on you. What do you got?
        - um yeah okay so um lunar you guys lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon, an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so, the orbiter at looks for the ice, I think, by going around the moon somehow.
        - yeah Farrah and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis.
        - Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines. But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q
        - Farrah, do you agree that NASA use a small machine.
        - Okay Chris, can you build.
        - So Chris is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does anybody have a suggestion for what Chris to do next, Luis?
        - I said  the small machine, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong. 
        - Yeah, well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. But before we go, I just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers.
        - Yes, can I try and.
        - Does anybody know what they use you either the hydrogen oxygen for within the water?
        - Um, yeah. OK. So the paragraph. Let's see, they say in the last paragraph, paragraph three, and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely.
        - You too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample.
        - Okay, let me look. I don't remember. That's a small machine called a lunar orbiter. That's the small machine. It's the lunar orbiter Chris.
        - I wrote about curing it, but I guess you can't that's not what it's used for.
        - well, we can't quiet do the thumbs, but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree, is that okay?
        - Good job for knowing the answer. Anyone else want to try? Luis, do you want to go? Yeah, go ahead.
        - Yeah okay so small machine um
        - So you can start working in your small groups.
        - Okay um would anyone, like to add to the response further would anyone like to even further refine savannas response.
        - So I feel like the answer is lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, can I try.
        - So, Jazmin was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope. So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers.
        - Well, I guess I didn't really read that part because I didn't think I had to read the part cuz I already know man
        -  Okay i'm Chris, you need equipment and your answer, so I said oxygen tanks, because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon.
        - Okay. Anyone else anyone else have any guesses?
        - So, Jazmin, what do you think
        - equipment and what else, Farrah can you help out. What kind of equipment does it want to know about.
        - OK. OK.
        -  Did anyone have a different answer than Farrah.
        - And I'm sure that Farrah and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool.
        - Do you guys know what did NASA send to help investigate Jazmin.
        - Oh, OK. OK.
        - Oh, my mind was going to be different, I was just gonna add on to mine that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - does anyone else, want to add on to what the word equipment means.
        - So I want you guys to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource.
        - or Chris, do you have any suggestions.
        - I guess. So you can have what we talked with Farrah, and Oliver here, right, which, if you don't mind. So
        - um well when I was reading the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The Lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the Lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Jazmin um How does that sound to you, what do you think.
        - That's great. So do you guys think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon.
        - Sure. Well, I know that a couple of you guys had your hand raised. But Chris, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help Oliver with his words. Since you guys may have similar answers.
        - Why don't Chris, you talk with Jazmin. I want to see what you two can come up with together.
        - So I just want to zero back in on a different part of the story. Did anybody find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool?
        - Luis is Oliver right
        - Yeah, I mean, it's like, close enough. He couldn't he has to better words, I think. But yeah, he got the idea.
        - Okay, well, I said NASA send a small machine, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - That's what I think. Does anybody agree.
        -  did anyone circle something different Farrah.
        - Alright perfect now I am going to have Dave and Farrah partner up and talk to each other about what you were just thinking about.
        - Who agrees with Farrah that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things.
        - Did we read about that. Oliver?
        - Or would you go with your first answer.
        - What do you guys think that does it sound like a good enough explanation, Farrah and Oliver?
        - Luis, make sure that we're raising her hand. What do we think
        - Oh, I'm kind of had a different idea. I was just thinking like you, I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits. 
        - Okay, so, so I was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to Luis And you're talking about them needing to drink on
        - Well, I agree with Farrah. I'm because I'm not really sure, like, well, Farrah had a question about it.
        - Does anyone else think they could answer Farrah's question?
        - I'm still kind of, you know, like I i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like,
        -  and then Chris you're going to build.
        - Um, well, I think it looks for the for the water
        - Okay, perfect. So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for. What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - Do people or agree or disagree with what Chris just said that the Lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah.
        - I mean, excuse me i'm gonna do Farrah and death and then Chris Jazmin eat less or two groups so YouTube and then the other three.
        - Okay, yeah. And so what did that small machine do? Chris, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?
        - So I basically. So I was thinking about what word is like
- intent: r130.3
  examples: |
        - And they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water 
        - but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter.
        - And that's what actually finds the water
        - Right, and so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water. Now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water.
        - Okay, let me see.
        -  Yeah. So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future. It can be valuable. 
        - you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter, so they needed the microscope as well.
        - Reach Every ReadeR: So my answer---
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that should have been your answer.
        - You just needed a little bit more. so in addition to using a microscope, they also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh, but I guess. So how do you figure that out? Is it just because you're the teacher, you know, you know,
        - but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, Jazmin was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father.
        - Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer. But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use.
        - It is. But they didn't use it to discover the water.
        - Yeah, OK.
        - The truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water. 
        - That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely. But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time. 
        - that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine. it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second Oliver. I wanted to talk about Luis's note Luis's answer on the oxygen tanks. Totally right
        - That's how you got to know that there's water on it.
        - So if we look in the reading. We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So that's another tool.
        - So you just had what they found. um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely Oliver.
        - fully answer the question right. so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water.
        - equipment that they used
        - But we also need Jazmin's part of the answer that. How did they even get the water down here? They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it.
        - A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so all you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use
        - Okay, so you just needed to see
        - So you might have circled water as well.
        - that's perfect that's the perfect question. that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you guys look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water.
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it, they had to use a microscope.
        -  but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a... what does anyone know what that what it's called that they sign.
        - The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery. can you see that now, and the response.
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't think of how the heck
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water. Okay.
        - Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon?
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter.
        - Simply corrects without engaging the student (e.g., "The right answer is actually…")
        - Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff. So they didn't need that stuff.
        - But if we were to choose one answer to be correct. I would probably go with the lunar orbit. 
        - Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for.
        - yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful.
        - yeah Okay, I see that right there.
        - It would take a long time. But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use, 
        - Oh, okay, well, okay, now I know the answer.
        - Yes. And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water.
        - So how did they find the water
        - Right. Yes. And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely.
        - So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture. And then the name for it-        - it's lunar orbiter. OK? 
        - yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter.
        - Well, I'm glad you brought that up. Well, in our story in the moon is a desert. It doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon, so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today.
        - Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay 
        - um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - And actually, the water would be valuable in the future.
        - Okay, yes. Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing.
        - But I just wanted to go over that specific question with all of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter. So that should have been the answer that we wrote down
        - Well actually it's it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer, but we actually find the whole answer.
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope.
        - Can I just say it like how you said? A lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon.
        - And so in this case case. In this case, the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter. 
        - NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead.
        - Oh, wow, ok. 
        - They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water. 
        - Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water.
        - Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water.
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that. Right. They sent the lunar orbiter up
        - But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water. 
        - Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter.
        - To investigate right.
        - And so I just had to say lunar orbiter?
        - And it went. So instead, it it checked for water on the moon.
        - yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - So I would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink.
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - Like Farrah, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter.
        - Oh OK OK, I understand okay.
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - And that's what they helped find water 
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it.
        - Mr. Teacher?
        - they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter. 
        - new findings.
        - And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon. That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it.
        - Yes, they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover it. And then they use the microscope to study, I think, is that right
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one. That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water.
        - So when we write our answer.
        - Oh, so like they like found it using the Lunar Orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it.
        - So they did use a microscope, but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon. 
        - Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture.
        - So as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text. You can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished.
        - yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - And I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like.
        - about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon.
        -  um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits, but the microscope you need to look at the deposits.
        -  so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water. 
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose. 
        - And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon.
        - Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water. Of what that they found so they would add that. So the answer, like a complete answer that I'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon.
        - so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two, I saw that I found a lunar lunar orbiter.
        - Teacher : Um, but it's a small machine that's called Old Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,
        - So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article.
        - uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three.
        - But there's other ways to detect it. So in this case, they didn't. It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope. 
        - So they use the Lunar Orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it.
        - The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate. 
        - is to travel around the moon and discover.
        - And um I also noticed, you know Chris like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find.
        - That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope 
        - And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Close. I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there. 
        - and they didn't use oxygen tanks, although they do use them. They did not use them to find the water on the moon.
        - yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose.
        - Okay. Um, can I try again. Can I do another answer.
        - into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable 
        - awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does.
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon.
        - It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Things like the microscope.
        - So yeah.
        - Yeah. So though small machine was named the Lunar Orbiter. That was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface.
        - No.
        - So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink. 
        - Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater.
        - No. They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water.
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen.
        - The lunar orbiter was the machine that NASA sent to investigate to look for ice deposits
        - and on paragraph two, you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water, 
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry.
        - I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?
        - Oh so just have to add the name in there too.
        -  they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right 
        -  they have a satellite go up right to do all of this.
        - That has a microscope.
        - Okay. All right. Now I should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like I guess I could what Jazmin said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter.
        - Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?
        - Teacher and I don't mean to interrupt you, but it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening. So like you, Jazmin. You explained that they sent a small machine. But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - On I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say.
        - Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes Chris.
        - and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water.
        - they put the microsope 
        - we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh well, I had a different piece of equipment, I said the microscope and.
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as Farrah, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        - So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too.
        - And for this particular reading The biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover. 
        - You say, both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it.
        - So is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right?
        - Right yeah because you said, well, that the craters you said they're not full of water, like, I thought right because the water is so small.
        -  Alright, so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water, but then the, the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope. 
        - And that is the name. It's not capitalized like your name, Jazmin's capitalized, Chris is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not. But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer. they're looking for. 
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water. 
        - and the ice deposits. That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        - So there's actually two answers 
        - looks for ice deposits. Right. So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - I don't understand because it says, Oh, what did they use to discover the water. And so, in paragraph two, they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits, and we we learned in science class that ice and water, are the same thing. Ice is just frozen water right?
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Oh, OK. So it's both.
        - Yes. Okay. See, I said that, yes, that the water would be valuable. And the reason that I said that. So astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. And so what I was looking at, basically, I wasn't a paragraph four, and they were saying that
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water.
        - So even though this astronauts went up there. Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them. 
        - Mm hmm. Yes. And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope. Right?
        - But with this specific question the answer that. is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter. That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water. 
        -  So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it.
        - Oh
        - And that's how we discover discover
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter. Okay.
        - Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon.
        - um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic
        - We actually do have water and craters here on earth 
        - That's close to my idea cuz I said in my answer. I said that NASA since the small machine, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource 
        - Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - That is the equipment that they used. All right.
        - Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine. The Lunar orbiter.
        - They didn't really use a microscope to find the water. The water was located underneath the ground.
        - yeah that wasn't the story.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way I know all I need to know.
        - But the last passage has our answer in it. 
        - The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful.
        - and based off the paragraphs as Chris said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons. 
        - Oh, but, but I did I had all the keywords I had equipment discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, Jazmin, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off. So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow.
        - And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which Farrah brought up and Oliver.
        - NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin. It's am from our end. I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage. Correct.
        - What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely. It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope.
        - Mm hmm. Exactly. They use all that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general. So that was helpful for them to be able to be there. And then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to Discover that water. 
        - You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water
        - That's right. That's right. So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes Farrah. 
        - RER: I have to write more words?
        - I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too
        - So even though we're not using the water right now. The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter. 
        - The lunar orbiter right.
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - yeah scientists found the evidence, but scientists found the evidence, but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and  then found the thing right.
        - All right. So yeah, you're right. They did send a small machine, but just so everybody knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter. 
        - Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine.
        -  so the craters are not full of water, they contains water yeah.
        - the scientists in this paragraph, according to the text, they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface.
        - So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - That is, that is correct. So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water. Does anyone have any questions about that?
        - So the question was, you know, they're trying, they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon, but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - is actually called a microscope.
        - But the first the first equipment that they sent discovered is water was the lunar arbiter
        - when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water.
        - There we go yeah good job, so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit.
        - The microscope is used for a different purpose. They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon.
        - That was just something that was on the moon.
        - Use
        - so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two.
        - Oh, interesting. Okay, gotcha. So like you would say both. Okay, interesting way.
        - The surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland, so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water.
        - Scientists use the Lunar Orbiter. Oh, okay, yeah. So scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you say, like right back scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon.
        - They went sent the machine to put the moon and , then they found some water right, yes, Oliver.
        - We would, we would say
        - Okay. Yeah. Okay, so they weren't actually there. So they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that. Luis Like, that's the thing to remember, like they didn't do that. Is that right,
        - Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope.
        - So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it. Once they found it.
        - yeah I saw that one.
        - OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon. Okay. 
        - Well, scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope. They had the machine. The Lunar Orbiter investigating the ground for that water.
        - Even though lunar orbiter is, which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists, a closer look. What we want to actually
        - Okay, but in the top of the reading. They talk about NASA as Jazmin was talking, they do send a small machine.
        -  However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there. Right. 
        - Right. Mm hmm. So that's all you would have to add to your answers, just that you can have more of its supply to you so they can drink it. Awesome. 
        - No, so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in 
        - However, I think that they have a plan for the water 
        - But I guess you could say, you know, they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it, but to actually see it, you would need the microscope.
        - When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon.
        - Think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used, which is the Lunar Orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text, it looks for ice deposits in large craters.
        - So they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon. That's just part of their, their work uniform and protective clothing.
        - You know, we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the Lunar orbiter.
        - Um, I don't think so. They sent a machine up there.
        - I did, yeah.
        - it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water.
        - So the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up, if you agree with.
        - So, is that just what I was missing was just the name of it?
        - Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter. Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter.
        - There's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon.
        - No, no, and I, I was, I just want to say aw thanks teacher, it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - The correct answer is a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh well, the microscope.
        - So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter. And that's what they used to see the ice deposits
        - So we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us.
        - So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water. They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things.
        - So what I thought would be the answer I was answering it would be the Lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water, so I thought it would be both 
        - So that's what they use to discover the moon, the water on the Moon was the Lunar Orbiter.
        -  Yeah. Yeah
        - Well, they didn't send a microscope. They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right
        - And that was the orbit. 
        - But they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity.
        - Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter.
        - They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right
        - Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes Luis?
        - Investigators is the same thing as discover right, 
        - It's a Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh yeah but I don't think they This time they sended those kinda equipment equipment, because on the moon, they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches, but not this time I don't think
        - or microscopes when looking for the water. When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter.
        - And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had. But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon.
        - I don't really think they could have. It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use. So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are?
        - we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case.
        - yeah but um I if we're looking at this question in particular right, we do need to focus on  that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was. 
        - Oh yeah, that doesn't make sense. So they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon?
        - They might
        - The right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what NASA sent on to investigate the water on the moon.
        - So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent. Those are some options. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Um, I had the same answer as Farrah.
        - So they use that the Lunar Orbiter to investigate, but to see the water they had to use the microscope.
        - I don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff.
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. What does it do was
        - Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon. That makes sense.
        - Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink. So that's a valuable way that we could use water now.
        - So that's where you found about the microscope.
        - To discover water on the moon.
        -  so that's why you know the Lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question 
        - Oh Yeah. OK, I see that one right there. Yeah, OK, I see that.
        - Gotcha. Okay, so, so was like, like they may be need that stuff, but they didn't like use it necessarily this time.
        - So, to make our answer better. We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three, how come that's not the equipment.
        - Um, but, okay, well, I don't understand what, why [my answer] is wrong.
        - okay okay so we're both right 
        - You would need the microscope to be able to see it. So you and your answer and Oliver's answer was correct. It was a microscope.
        - Well they need them to breathe on the moon.
        - Yes, yeah it's true when you go swimming you go, you have to go through in the deep water, so that you know you have fun, but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not  in the deep water they went to the
        - Well um I I guess the Lunar orbiter is the right answer but I don't really understand why because.
        - Oh OK OK.
        - orbiter was arm.
        - interesting.
        - Oh, what do you do you
        - The Lunar
        - But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits. Correct?
        - microscopes are used for to find tiny, tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger. And we didn't use a microscope to go and look for, you know, water on the moon. We used the Lunar Orbiter, which was able to be controlled from, you know, from the earth.
        - but they use a different tool on the moon to discover
        - So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water, but to actually just for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon, as it says in paragraph to the machine was called a lunar orbiter. Okay.
        - To explore for water on the moon.
        - Oh, OK. I see. 
        - But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter. And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope. Oliveron? I mean Oliver, sorry.
        - So for you to
        - And the Lunar Orbiter. Right. We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things. Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean
        - Gotcha. Okay, that, that, that makes a little more sense. I think, I think that makes sense. Um,
        - Correct. They sent that small machine, the equipment. The Lunar Orbiter to investigate the moon.
        - Um, so I think that I understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the Lunar Orbiter, but I think I'm still not quite sure why. And I'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class. But thank you so much for working with us. We really enjoyed working with. Thank you.
        - yeah so that will be the answer.
        - So a microscope is a piece of equipment. But it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water.
        - So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something.
        - That's interesting. So they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it.
        - So we were looking for. They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Nope. So in the text. It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet. But as they were as time goes on It could be. I think that it could be valuable. 
        - If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope. However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Okay then not full of water. 
        - But what this article is talking about is how they discovered water on the moon, and I use a lunar orbiter to find [?] water on the moon.
        - So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water.
        - I just wanted to say that I went to NASA. So I also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too.
        - Well, I think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary, that the machine is called a lunar orbiter.
        - so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text.
        - And see the surface of the moon. 
        - They do, yeah. But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose. We're trying to figure out which
        - But the microscope is a machine.
        - Do you, you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water I think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators.
        - And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water.
        - Because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water.
        - No. What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words.
        - That isn't what they used to discover it. 
        - Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
        - you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters, but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water, instead of full of water, 
- intent: r140.1
  examples: |
        - Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it. what is your favorite thing about space Luis?
        - i'm i'm so sorry. I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment. um That was a really helpful way, to put it. Thank you so much.
        - and hydrogen is part of h2o. you heard people talk about h2o.
        - um okay I don't know exactly, but I think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know, like.
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at?
        - Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?
        - Right and how do you think you could? you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet. do you think you could work that into your answer?
        - Oh well, space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe? we don't even know. We just know we have our planet and we have the Milky Way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there.
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        - Yeah yeah we talk on Skype all the time.
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new. That's it. That's a really good reason to be reading current news.
        - i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if.
        - Great Jazmin can you teach us the Spanish word for moon?
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon? Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read? let's see Farrah.
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on.
        - Oh well, i'm actually I was gonna say I looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that.
        - Okay, okay, I think.
        - OK, cool.
        - That is pretty cool fiction. But if you look back in the older books from the past, a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen, and with science, we have brought it about. We are able to do a lot of things. Like back in the 1930s-        - is that a long time ago?
        - No way Chris that's so cool. would you guys like to go to the moon?
        - it's amazing. you can see, all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years.
        - it's something we can like lune
        - Oh. Oh. Well that's a good question. But I was gonna say first, just real quick because I went to NASA.
        - that's going to be possible, and what year was it? 2024.
        - Oliver have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?
        - OK. Is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story?
        - would anyone ever want to go to space?
        - yeah that's really cool. I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology.
        - Farrah. What about you? would you want to or would you not?
        - We plant cells in science class.
        - I mean, I think aliens are kind of cool. So yes, I'd be down to learn about that.
        - Yeah, so, um, one on are playing a video game when I use my Xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool.
        - Okay, how about how about.
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something. I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that. That that's really cool. That's really cool. Yeah.
        - Yeah, oh yeah, me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits. It was the coolest ever
        - Well, they're microscopic aliens that live in the very, very cold, because it's really, really cold on the moon. On that moon, it's like 200 below zero. So it's really cold there. But they think that with their equipment, like what they had on the moon that was-        - that they used to find the water on the moon, they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on Titan.
        - RER: You're a really good teacher. 
        - Yeah, me either. I think that's what the scientists thought too.
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about, 
        - me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to NASA so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon, and then what their plans are in the future.
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy. Was it fun?
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F. Kennedy center, or--
        - Um, yeah, I sort of knew
        - And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh.
        - I yeah he works at that that's Dennis Space Center. I'm in Mississippi, and he kind of like commute, so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like.
        - detectives.
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there. Luis or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article.
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game. Right. So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them.
        - um yeah I mean that'd be pretty cool you know, and then I could just kind of look down at earth and I can be like hey everybody down there i'm just chilling up here, even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do.
        - Oh well, I don't think I never really thought about that before, like maybe there is water on the moon, maybe around the moon. I wasn't really, I never really thought about it, I guess.
        - No. I didn't know anything about the Saturn stuff and the moons and, like, teeny-weeny aliens. That's like, wow. I mean, that is pretty cool stuff. I didn't know that.
        - You are correct. I went to NASA as well. When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment.
        - OK? Do you have anything else? Do you have any interest in that, Oliver, about the aliens on the moon of Saturn?
        - um yeah well I I shouldn't be in this room, because I already know all about space.
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month. Does that make sense?
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space.
        - So they're full of water at the bottom?
        - Is there anymore knowledge you guys have. Yes, Farrah.
        - Okay yeah I think we learned this, I think we learned this in science, because we learned that water as an H two O, and I know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen.
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know. But right now, you every one of your student at school, right. So what's an equipment you have right now. Thats helping you with your work, Chris.
        - yeah I thought it was a really interesting because I didn't actually know that there was water on the moon, before I read this and I thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter.
        - Know do you just like to read about this on your own.
        - Has anyone ever use a microscope before?
        - Yes. Saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it. And there's actually a moon that's called Titan. And they think that they may have found life on it.
        - I guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon.
        - well you could be.
        - Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that Oliver what were you gonna say.
        - I had a great time there as well.
        - That that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind.
        - Yes, I would say I would say I was surprised.
        - Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?
        - They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the.
        - Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know.
        - yeah and Jazmin like was this the spark any interest in you or yes.
        - how about you, Oliver. Were you surprised.
        - When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read.
        - do you like like space, do you like to.
        - Yeah, yeah, just like an aunt or something like that.
        - You won't run out of gas. And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station. We're not gonna turn back around, right.
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes.
        - Oh, like organisms.
        - i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah Luis.
        - I know. Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think? 
        - Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone.
        - Kind of how I think about it. Um like a refrigerator
        - so Luis has as well. Yeah, yeah.
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why Chris, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter.
        - I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?
        - This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age 
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact.
        - yeah Luis Do you know anything else about the moon.
        - Okay, have you ever used a microscope.
        - OK, I see it says that NASA scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen.
        - Tangential instruction without purposeful connection to question or text
        - You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those.
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close. It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Were you surprised Farrah, that the scientists found water on the moon.
        - um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it.
        -  in science.
        - I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that.
        - that's really cool fact Chris, where did you read that.
        - How did everybody like the reading.
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?
        - yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said Farrah made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so.
        - yeah yes three years away.
        - I definitely want to live on the moon.
        - Well, I didn't go to NASA, but I did, um, I've seen that in box. Yeah.
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr Oliveron.
        - Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space.
        - Huh. Oh, wow. That's pretty cool.
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert. Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad.
        - I mean i'd like to live on the moon.
        - So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay.
        - OK. Why would-        - why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks?
        - Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry Chris, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon.
        - I would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth.
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade. I wanted to be an astronaut. So obviously I didn't live up to that. But, you know, that was my goal.
        - Oh man, I know all sorts of stuff. I know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space. It's a vacuum. So you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and I know that like
        - Oh, well I thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah, it's really cool there. I had a great time with my dad.
        - really like space i'm also big fan of space to.
        - yeah me too.
        - yeah well, I have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water?
        - Well i'm a little bit I can try.
        - You like the martian?
        - But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things        - it's very interesting.
        - Oh, well, that's great. It seems like you learned something today. Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert.
        - Um, okay. So I can say I should ask and drink the water. You can't survive without water, having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft, water is heavy.
        - Is a while you're looking at it. I'm gonna go back to Luis because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts. 
        - Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group.
        - wow.
        - Because they can't breathe. The atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here.
        - Yeah, it's a good movie. 
        - Well, or if there's water on the moon.
        - Oh well, okay um I want to look at Jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane, and I really want to look at that.
        - And people thought that was just going to be-        - that was science fiction, and that was not realistic. But do we have it today?
        - um well, I mean, I guess, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't want to like you know, like live in a space suit, like all the time, that would be like really uncomfortable.
        - Do you?
        -  Well um I just found it surprising that there was water on the moon, I never thought about that, before, so I was very surprised.
        - It was a lot of fun. We got to see a lot of space shuttles, and astronaut, space chutes, and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space.
        - All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay. You're sitting there were at school.
        - Oh, thank you, Oliver. Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward. Luis
        - You know all about space really where did you learn about space. Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum.
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer. Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - jas Jazmin you're not so interested in going to the moon.
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes. Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end.
        - That's really good. Well, it sounds exciting. Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - Oh yeah oh big time I watch all these videos about space on YouTube and and I really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity Chamber oh yeah I really like space.
        - Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think.
        - Yes, yes, we have.
        - So Luis did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts.
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space.
        - Oh, LAUGHS
        - Yeah, with my dad. I went to NASA. So I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like
        - No, I meant on the story. My teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small group, because we needed more help with our answers. But I told her that I think that I have the right answer.
        - Yeah, yeah. There was stuff in there.
        - Yes, I can share.
        - and Spanish word for me is Luna.
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share.
        - and Luis one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon.
        - Luis, why do you want to go to the moon.
        - I'm not really into space, so--
        - Yes, yes. My dad, me and my dad went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment, like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to--
        - yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different.
        - yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one Chris.
        - Well, I don't know a lot about space, but I know that our environment is really bad. And so we might have to live on Mars or something if they keep destroying our Earth.
        - Okay Jazmin do you speak Spanish.
        - So like an ant.
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know. So can you tell me what what do you know about space.
        - Okay, well, I know a lot about space, I know all about the different planets and I know stuff about uhm stars that Milky Way the sun kind of all the all the big ones.
        - Oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there, I can't wait, I really want to go to space camp, because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut, and I want to discover new planets and galaxies too.
        - Um, um, yeah, like on a car.
        - Um, so, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just really wanted to thank you for working with us, and in particular.
        - The John F. Kennedy center.
        - Oh, that is so awesome. Has he told you about these kind of thing.
        - That's, I love that answer. Do you like to garden yourself Jazmin.
        - Yeah, he, he talks about it all the time. And like, that's how come I know so much about space.
        - It looks pretty disgusting really.
        - Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish.
        - Oh well, I like to watch a lot of videos like on YouTube. So I look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket. Oh, it's so cool.
        - Um, so, I saw a microscope, like in science class. Um like, I've seen it in a couple places, but I think we've all seen it in science class. And also we've like, you know, we've seen it in movies and stuff like that.
        - Well, I just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now.
        - Oh, all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than I thought it was.
        - Oh yeah my dad took so many pictures, it was actually kind of embarrassing.
        - GASPS
        - You know, I think we did
        - Yes, what thing that you see.
        - Oh well, I actually went to NASA and well I didn't know there was water on the moon, but I thought it was really cool.
        - Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon.
        - That would be pretty cool. Yeah.
        - Right you all drink water every day right.
        - Um, I guess so. But I don't I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - OK. Well, that's OK. A lot of people aren't into space. Some people are more into the environment, like Jazmin was talking about. Some people are into the oceans and stuff, which is very interesting too to learn about. How about you, Farrah? Do you have any input to go with the group?
        - um not Really, about the moon, no.
        - How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft. What do you say,
        - We'll just get more gas and keep going.
        - what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?
        - How about you, Jazmin. Were you surprised.
        - Luis do you speak Spanish.
        - We got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and I really wanted to try it on but.
        - You went to NASA? Really?
        - Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now.
        - Isn't. Tell me what you know about space.
        - You mean like spacesuits?
        - And experience this.
        - Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?
        - All right, so Chris. Where did you see a microscope at
        - yeah isn't that cool.
        - Yeah, I never thought there would be water on the moon. I thought it was just, I don't know, dry up there.
        -  yeah Okay, I know they just landed the MARS Rover.
        - Um, it's at the top and the bottom
        - Like, well we use it in like science class
        - Well, I watch YouTube and I watched Nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space.
        - Did you guys like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?
        - They wouldn't get stranded. You are right, think about like a gas station. So if you drive very far. And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station. What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip.
        - Oh wow that's really interesting, are you really passionate about space.
        - Oh yeah, So they use on a breathe because, while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins, they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces.
        - yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like.
        - Um, well, there's like, I know all about like rocket launches and I know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like I know that like space is a vacuum. Like, all that kind of stuff.
        - OK. That is a lot of good information. Does anybody else have anything to say about that? Any input on what you think about space?
        - Yeah, excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - There's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others.
        - But we never think about how it would be to actually exist. There are walk around on the moon. So I agree with you. I think that's a really cool thing.
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper. I don't want you to write down what all you know about space. Okay.
        - Okay, I love watching like the
        - um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know.
        - yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon.
        - Um, well, I go to the bank with my mom sometimes, and she'll deposit her paycheck, but I don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money.
        - You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing. Now, just like when they did their research.
        - Does everybody here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you.
        - So you like to read
        - And there was cartoons and books about phones.
        - Oh, I watch a lot of videos on YouTube and sometimes I read articles, like in magazines and I have this book with all these pictures of space Oh, I really like space.
        - And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets.
        - Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned.
        - Well, I read-        - I read this book, A Wrinkle in Time, which is about going to different universes. So they didn't go into space, but they traveled through space and time.
        - Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher.
        - Oh, man. No, no. When me and my dad went to NASA, we saw about that the whole controversy about when Pluto was a planet, and then it wasn't a planet, and then it was a planet, but I didn't know anything about Saturn.
        - How did they get to the moon.
        - Oh that's cool Farrah what about you Where would you go what planning, would you.
        - Oh yeah, absolutely. So I saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship. If they had to do, like, you know what I mean, like a spot.
        - I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment.
        - To the next time. Invite me. 
        - It's just a few of us.
        - Yes. That's pretty good stuff. What do you think about that, AUDIO OUT]? You know, there and outer space and stuff. Yes.
        - Yeah, like a magnifying glass. How many of you have ever seen a microscope.
        - Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not.
        - A tool. So give me some examples of tools. Debbie had your hand raised. Can you give me an example of a tool.
        - Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day.
        - Yes. Yes, and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using, with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there.
        - So did you enjoy reading the passage
        - Based on our reading.
        - On i'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say.
        - Okay, because there isn't any gravity. I mean there isn't gravity in space, but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide. So the site, so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space, so they have, they have a whole a whole space suit.
        - Your answer wasn't wrong. You were talking about the atmosphere, which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from Earth. Which that is very good that you said.
        - Oh well, my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked Pluto out of the planet club because he was too small.
        - Really Luis some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use.
        - Okay, I know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space, and I know that there's no gravity up there, so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon, and a bunch of other stuff too.
        - Oh you already know a lot about space. Good. What do you want me to tell me about space Luis?
        - Yeah, absolutely. That's absolutely right. Is there anybody else that wanted to share a tool.
        - Oh, what kind of stuff did you see.
        - Have you ever seen something through a microscope.
        - Um, so I just wanted to say. Um, I already kind of know like all about space and like I kind of like know like all this stuff. So I don't think I need to be in this group.
        - Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space.
        - Oliver. Go ahead. I like that shirt I have the same shirt. Actually, that's a really cool shirt.
        - Is space something you're interested in Luis?
        - yeah so in Spanish it's Luna.
        - Oh yeah I lot of space and I really want to be an astronaut, when I grow up.
        - Good afternoon, everyone. How is everyone doing please raise your hand.
        - That seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration Maybe you can after we have our small group discussion tell us some interesting facts 
        - what's your favorite thing about space Luis.
        - Oliver, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?
        - buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah Chris do you have something to add?
        - Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know.
        - Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible. But if you read it. That's super cool. Where do you read it up.
        - Yes, I do.
        - What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity.
        - I like that movie.
        - I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base 
        - Yeah. So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?
        - That's pretty amazing. Luis I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter.
        -  but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that Oliver.
        - And since there's water on the moon, maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden, so that we could grow food.
        - that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible.
        - If you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group.
        - Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you, Miss I burnt. I think I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. So thanks for working with us.
        - yeah Oh, it was so cool I would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon.
        - I don't know it's kind of amazing to think about.
        - Oh, what do you know about space.
        - Yes. Yes, you do. Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope.
        - That is a good point. Because if our atmosphere, which is the air that we breathe, which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space, if that is messed up, then we won't have any air here on Earth, so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live. How about you, Oliver? Do you have anything to input?
        - Those are really beautiful ideas, thank you for sharing Jazmin. Farrah, why are you interested in going to the moon.
        - yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death, second, they have to wear oxygen tanks, because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there, so they got to wear gravity boots.
        - Yeah, like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba.
        - Oh, some some article in a magazine.
        - How about you, Chris.
        - Alright, so let's go over. I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let Farrah, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space. Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space.
        - yeah yeah 
        - This is all true. Luis knows this, correct.
        - So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?
        - No. We'll just get more gas. 
        - Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories.
        - Well.
        - Well science videos, my family. We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn
        - In polar crater. So what does that mean, is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom
        - Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time.
        - Yes, I love to garden and I love to be in nature.
        - So they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that, possibly, maybe.
        - We wouldn't run out of gas.
        - Person. You are so passionate about space. Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older.
        - Oh, yeah, I know a lot about that equipment.
        - Okay, so where we left off. We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O
        - yeah well, we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans, by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle.
        - no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right.
        - No no, he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people. Um, yeah, to kind of find it out.
        - I do know that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay. When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?
        - Jazmin could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere.
        - But I'm just wanting you to look at it and different views. So in one week that might be a lot of money. But when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money.
        - Yeah. Me too. Me too. I thought this was great. I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night. So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me.
        - I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or.
        - How about Jazmin? Can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what Chris and Luis is telling us?
        - Right, right. And it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space, which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations. Like have you seen the latest results and stuff from Titan, the moon on Saturn?
        - Yes, they didn't have phones back then, the cell phones, like this. They didn't have anything like that. They had to wind on the wall.
        - Possibly. So I mean, at this point in time and this year. Anything could happen. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening. Yes.
        - They would have to make a-        - what would they need in order to be able to do a really good garden on the moon?
        - Oh, my oh wow oh that's really hard um I think my favorite thing about space as how um Pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet.
        - Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text, 
        - i'm Jazmin do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?
        - I'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading. I didn't know that before today.
        - So I just would surely we have to go to lunch.
        - Okay, well,
        - Oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student.
        - Oh wow, yes. Yes, we've got lots of phones.
        - it's so cool.
        - awesome thanks Luis okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday.
        - I agree. I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters.
        - So where did they find the water?
- intent: r150.1
  examples: |
        - Um, well, actually. You might know a lot about space, but we're gonna go over what you guys read in the text. So it might be something that new that you might not know
        - Exactly, so not what they used to look at it. So I wanted to go back. Is there anybody else who wants to share on that and that issue?
        - Does anybody else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left? Farrah.
        - We've all read the article
        - Okay, yeah.
        - Um, yeah, I think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense. So like Farrah, you're saying that like basically like that, you know, if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it. You have to find it First, is that right?
        - OK, that's great that you know a lot about space, but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about. Being in this group doesn't mean you don't know about it. it just means that I just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought. OK?
        - Yeah, okay. So when I was reading the
        - So I just want to make sure that everyone knows what they're reading and how we can really bring out the best in all of you guys.
        - Right fantastic. Okay, so you read the article water on the moon.
        - does that make sense? yeah yeah.
        - Jazmin, do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon?
        - um you're right, I did say to expand on your answers um and you know I try to thing everyone's answer can be right. I mean um.
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit. And let's just see where we get. Okay.
        - Thank you for your help. Today, Luis, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today.
        - Does that make sense?
        - Understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And each one of you had different answers in your journals.
        - we have a lot of good information. And so, so we've decided and
        - um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay.
        - And whenever somebody thinks they have the answer, just raise your hand and i'll call on you.
        - So I I read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024, and it was just making me think like.
        - I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - i'm Luis I think that you guys all have it figured out, but I think that if we just look at it a little more in depth, we could just get our answers to that much better 
        - Yeah, I guess that's a few less words. Okay.
        - And that we all can come to a solid answer for the prompt. So you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too. So I'm glad that you're the expert. I appreciate that. Thank you.
        - It's time for the next group. So thank you so much for working with us.
        - It won't be boring. trust me. it'd be super excited.
        - can we now see why that makes sense?
        - Is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and I wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates.
        - So we're talking about how we just read the moon, is a desert, and I know that, yes, Luis.
        - If you understand what I'm saying, please. Nod your head to let me know.
        - Oh, that's okay. It's always fun to be with groups.
        - And look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way.
        - Oh, it was so cool.
        - And if you understand what I'm saying please know that your head to let me know.
        - Yes, so the machine is the Lunar Orbiter, do you agree?
        - So we'll be talking about your responses to the question. is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable? um so first of all I your I like your responses all. they're all different, and I like that. so what's what's taught was start with Farrah so you're your.
        - hi it's nice to see you all again and I am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon 
        - Them. What did you think
        - Wow, I'm sure you know, tons about space, but we're always open to learning more and more so.
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way. But let's talk about this for just a minute. 
        - No, that makes sense. So like I should just say like in detail, like what it was
        - hi everyone i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small group, so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon. 
        - Does anybody else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article?
        - Yeah, of course. And Oliver, do you have a question?
        - You guys think so?
        - Very good. So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is. 
        - Um, I just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut.
        - Okay guys so now we're going to work on question number two.
        - And i'm going to tell you exactly what I, what I want you to do, and I want you to apply that. You may understand it now, but I still want to tell you my concerns just so you and I are both on the same page.
        - Okay. So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking 
        - Well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all, you always have an open mind to learn more.
        - Does anyone want to add to that anything that they heard while I was reading
        - yeah I think we're ready to go.
        - How about you, Luis. Did you read it for me.
        - Does that make sense to everyone.
        - Right. Nice job. All right. Does anyone else have anything they want to add to this discussion, Oliver. What do you want to add
        - So, are you guys ready to share back with the class.
        - So we answered our last question. So we're going to move on to a new question.
        - So does that make sense. Chris, I saw your hand go up. So does that make sense as to why
        -  I just want to make sure that you guys are getting it and I want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so Jazmin are you ready to take your time.
        - because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question.
        -  so could anyone like to have a dialogue about that.
        - I mean, I guess so. Because I don't have a job and so like, so I don't really get, like, you know, for grownups and and how much money they have. Um
        - Okay, are you ready to share what you got what the new partner.
        - I mean that is going to really be helpful. Were you listening when I was talking to Chris early earlier.
        - yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this room, I already know all about space.
        - Chris Chris, and he said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Is that making sense to you. Farrah as well.
        - Oh well, you know the the greatest minds in the world, always always now I learned something new, every day, so you know you try give it a shot, you know, keep an open mind to it.
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys. Would that be okay?
        - I do, I do, I do. Luis is. Yeah. I have a question.
        - Oh yeah oh OK that's fine.
        - Um, maybe I think
        - So today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion.
        - To the text, but I want to talk a little bit about how everyone responded after reading the text and I just want to kind of ask one more time.
        - Or you could use maybe something you found on your own. You don't need to use what you said.
        - Here, because sometimes other people know more about other things than us, we want to make sure that we all hear each other out there Jazmin had a great answer and you just expanded on it, so we all get to work together here, which is awesome.
        - OK, so the Lunar Orbiter. Good job. So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?
        - Okay. Appreciate that answer. Luis So maybe we could look at this together. And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        - So Oliver and Farrah i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first 
        - awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs.
        - And the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable.
        - Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong, um, cuz I pull mine from the text to
        - yeah um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Okay awesome um so Jazmin do you have any questions about your response.
        - OK, so now, hearing back from all of your responses and everything, they sound amazing, but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text. Yes, Luis, I believe.
        - Oh well, you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might.
        -  I actually chose all of you, because I think all of your insights are very valuable and I really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking 
        - maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can all learn from each other how's that sound.
        - Anybody have any questions about that question?
        - i'm still kind of confused 
        - Farrah any you look a little, little stunned. Is there something I can help you with
        - but let's focus on this test.
        - Does anybody have any questions remaining about that.
        - So cool, you know, lots of books space. Right. Yes. You're going to help us out. Maybe the article can teach you a couple things to that'd be pretty cool expand your knowledge.
        - That you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense.
        - Guys, excuse me.
        - Luis, you are very smart. But there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more, OK?
        - Hi guys. So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to all look back to the
        - By water. We're so small they have to use a microscope to see it.
        - yeah yeah I wrote a lot more um I mean I wrote a lot more like not words but you know, like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story.
        - Oh no, not really. I just added more details.
        - um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in all that outside knowledge, because.
        - Um, because I really think that all your thoughts are important. Okay. So because of your, of your opinions are important in their contribution good information for this class.
        - Um, well, actually, our story. It's on our tablet right in front of us, so we can see it there.
        - Okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because I want to talk about your answer after Jazmin's done., alright sound like a good plan?
        - All right, so I think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts
        - Honestly, not totally like I got back. Maybe they used both, but I don't really see why it's not the microscope.
        - um yeah so I shouldn't be and that's group I already know all about space.
        - About 10 more seconds. Is everybody done reading. 
        - i'm i'm still kind of confused.
        - does that make sense.
        - yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water?
        - Well it's always great to expand your knowledge, because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject.
        - I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident. I want you to well fake it and see what happens. If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction.
        - I'm going to go back over to Oliver and savannas group. So keep working.
        - Sure do.
        - Um, yeah, that makes sense. So like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope.
        - Okay. And once you run it. You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today.
        - yeah I had that equipment, I said on oxygen tanks, in my answer
        - Sweet.
        - Does that make sense to you all.
        -  And that's what we're doing right now in this class. We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers.
        - In small groups are like first of all to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions.
        - And protective caps on here we go. 
        - We're just going to look deeper into them and kind of, you can explain your thinking to me. So then I can understand better and we can help each other, understand better so that sound good.
        - So I was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water.
        - We're going to talk about our
        - But part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say Chris can share, about space that you know that I don't know or that Oliver doesn't know and vice versa,
        - All right, well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay.
        - Do you need a reminder of what the question was?
        - Alright guys, so we just shared our great answers for the question but I just-
        - What about making is that making more sense to you.
        - You can shake your head, yes or no, if you can.
        - Yeah, I think so. So we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers.
        - And we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - It's not a question. But I was just looking at the clock, and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Well cuz, you said that So the answer was a good answer, but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and I wrote like a lot of words, because you told us to expand our answers but they're different.
        - Well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our class with us.
        - Exactly. That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track. 
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something. 
        - Oh, I don't think I know I don't understand why I'm why it's not the microscope.
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article. But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        -  and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you, how does that sound.
        - Nice to meet you too. I understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon. Am I correct you read it already.
        - Yes, those are perfect things to add, um, do you have any other questions before we move on?
        - For our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon 
        - Okay, yeah, sounds good to me.
        - Is everyone done?
        - hey also Farrah Chris and Luis have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a group, to see where we're at 
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries
        - Okay, friends, usually in my classes when students agree we go like this, but if you agree. You can raise your hand if you disagree with savannas thoughts and just keep your hand down and we respectfully agree and respectfully disagree. Right.
        - Jump back into the text into what we were doing before. Does anyone remember what we were working on before
        - You understand?
        - Does that make sense. Chris?
        - Okay, so let's just start. Okay. So raise your hand if you are ready, read the lecture there. That is cool. The moon is a desert.
        - Yeah, yeah. So believe it or not, we can do close reading in Science right and social studies to find out, we're looking for. 
        - Oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there, like Maybe it was a like a NASA they call it an unmanned pro.
        - i'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - So remember, um, I want to listen to all of your thoughts.
        - Cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers. Okay Luis Do you have a question.
        - Yeah. Yeah
        - um yeah so I picked I picked something different from Farrah so i'm wondering, because I said NASA send a small machine and I thought that the small machine seemed really important.
        - so do you have any questions for me on that well.
        - Doing good. Thank you for asking. So you all read a passage about discovering water on the moon. Is that correct,
        - Are there any questions.
        -  how do you feel about that.
        - To all guys. So all of you guys read the text and gave good answers. So to start off, we're gonna start with Farrah.
        - And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space. So why don't you stick with us and
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn. Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn. That's awesome. That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe, 
        - Oh, that's awesome. So yes, we all revise and corrected our answers. I just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure
        - So even if you know all about space right I think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this group today does that sound okay.
        - That feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you.
        - okay does that sound good.
        - What do you confused about.
        - Excuse me, a teacher. I hadn't been on this group, I already know all about space.
        - awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does anyone have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct.
        - The great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions.
        - I'm glad you liked it. Does anyone want to share anything important that they read
        - Okay, does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense. 
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - Okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that I can assist you with.
        - Absolutely. So do you understand how your answer was right. But we could have made it just a little bit more detail.
        - Well, um, I. It's me Jazmin. I said that they used a small machine that was my answer.
        - does that make sense to Luis.
        - So I'm going to give you a minute to go back
        - I just want to make sure that you understand all of what what we just talked about and stuff. And what we read. This is just to help you understand, just a little more
        - Um, I mean, I guess so. I guess.
        - I think so.
        - Oh well, that's really that's helpful, but the reason we're in this group is, I wanted to explore a little more deeply i'm really interested in what you understand about this article overall right and how how the whole process works.
        - um yeah excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Right, and no student is wrong. We all have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon.
        - hey you really know what you're talking about, and it also shows that you found your answer from the text. Does that make sense, everyone?
        - I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - love the um does anyone else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for Jazmin house and the Farrah are you good.
        - So I want to hear all of your ideas.
        - See what you can learn today. Alright.
        - Better. Okay. Okay. Teacher, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Does everybody agree with this?
        - Um, yeah, so I I think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space.
        - yeah that makes a lot.
        - does that sound good.
        - Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so
        - All right does anyone have any questions about their responses and how they can help to make them better.
        - So we want to dig a little bit deeper than that okay.
        - Well, we're just going to go through your guys' answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it. I think you all have a pretty good understanding, but I want to make sure you know fully what's going on.
        - Oh, I thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right.
        - Does that make sense, do you have any questions.
        - not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable. Does that make sense?
        - Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said.
        - Yeah, sure, OK. So I circle the last sentence in the text. You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - and you've all had some really good answers, and I can see you're working really hard.
        - Well, I think we're all going to work together to form a deeper understanding of the article. 
        - You understand? 
        - OK. Mr. Lawrence, I just looked at the clock, and it's time for the next group, so we'll have to see you later.
        - So we just finished reading Our texts water on the moon.
        - So I put us to sit in this small group, because I really liked you guys's answer, but I wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers 
        - Oh okay wait so sorry, you said you shouldn't be in this group, because you know all about space?
        - but we are going to look a little bit deeper.
        - I know I think that we all understand. And I think that we just wanted to share. So we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch.
        - Well, I think there's always room. To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses.
        - In your own words. You can do that.
        - Yeah, so I went to NASA. So I know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?
        - does that make sense.
        - is that all right.
        - Ways that it can be valuable. If we look back in the text. The text will give us so many different examples.
        - Oh, well, you know, everyone learn something new, no matter how much you know about it. There's always something to learn about something.
        - And it was definitely tricky to find and it would maybe take even reading it a couple times to find that
        - So did anybody talk about that? Let's see.
        - And who knows, you might even learn something new, as
        - Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question. Okay.
        - Oh, I know you do we all, definitely know all about space, and I know you all wrote some well all a lot of great answers, but we just want to take the time to make sure that your sentences are.
        - Yeah, I could do that. That sounds cool.
        - I feel like I had the right answer.
        - Does that make a little more sense. Luis
        - Hi I'm Farrah well
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better. 
        - Okay. If you have any questions, let me know. 
        - You're going to listen and fully listen to your partner.
        - yeah it's good good good to hear, so I brought you all, and you know it's a as a group, because you guys all had very various answers to the prompts.
        - He looked at Luis's answer, and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff, but it sounds like that's not really the right answer.
        - Perfect. So we're just going to go over so you guys get a bit of a more clear understanding of this passage.
        - Yes, me i'm sorry to interrupt.
        - Alright guys, any more questions can be any other way. Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question.
        - So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers.
        - And I'm so excited that I got to hear all of your answers because together we can explore more about the moon and more about scientific tools and what scientists have used for their equipments to discover some moon aspects and I hear every student has a different answer.
        - I can, I can I.
        - Alright, so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and I want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so everyone has really good specific details and different questions yeah even.
        - does that makes sense.
        -  um I have a question.
        - Alright so what we're going to talk about now. Did you all get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon.
        - Anybody else have a question?
        - So one tool to help us is to make sure we look at the question really carefully that's going to give us some clues or some science to what look for. 
        - Um, yeah. So I've kind of already like, I know all about space. So I don't think I really even the be in this group.
        - We read it. We read it already.
        - Oh, Luis, you know plenty about space, but I just want to talk about what we learned in the text and what kind of interested us.
        -  If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer. So the question is,
        - Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon. I noticed we kind of had a
        - Do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water 
        - Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person. We're going to take a look at that. So our question that was posed to us.
        - Yeah, okay. So in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine. 
        - Okay, so in the second paragraph, I saw that on them the equipment that Jazmin just said, the Lunar orbiter.
        - So you kind of see where we went wrong?
        - um and I think Luis although your response was very interesting, I think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay.
        - A small question.
        - that sound good i'll give you about a few minutes to do that, while I go talk to another okay.
        - Let's look at that. Did you have questions. Let's see.
        - Any questions.
        - We are going to take a few minutes to reflect on our takeaways from our revised answers.
        - His answer is not that you guys answered anything wrong at all, just to kind of think more about it.
        - Jazmin. Do you know what that means.
        - yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes Oliver
        - A good attitude to keep is that never know.
        - So they're using their background knowledge so me and Oliver get it because we don't know as much about space as then
        - yeah it makes sense to use that I have to use it okay.
        - Good to see you too. I think that we should talk about our answers and relating to the text that we just read because I'm on getting the idea that you  May not have completely understood the equipment that was used to find that water on the moon. 
        - So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example. For instance,
        -  and Luis that I believe that kind of answers your question right.
        - We're just going to try and adjust the sentences. Just a little bit.
        - um yeah yeah okay.
        - Yeah, so actually I went to NASA. So I know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Right. Give me a raised hand to show me that you are done, highlighting the main point in the second paragraph. 
        - Have you guys read the test, I did you.
        - Okay, does anybody else have any questions so far?
        - And you know what that might add to that information that's in your brain, you might learn something new.
        - Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to Luis to you read and see if you can find something different than Farrah. 
        - Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a group.
        - Good to see you too. So right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the The story about not the story the reading about the moon
        - Well, I think it means something really small.
        - do you all remember answering this question?
        - On not yet I think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what Oliver had for his answer.
        - Um, well. I mean, I guess.
        -  I can read it.
        - Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - You guys have any more questions.
        - Well, there's always more that you can learn. And if you feel that you are an expert on the topic, you can always share with your classmates, so they know more or just as much as you do.
        - So I'm going To the question and your answer really quick.
        - I'm so impressed all set to go. Okay. You can put your hands down. And let's make sure before we continue doing any reading. Let's make sure we're clear about what we're looking for.
        - So that's great. Well, we're all going to just go over answers and see if there's anything to make them even better than they are now. Because you never know, you might even learn something new too.
        - Doesn't say that right. No, it doesn't say that. 
        - In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time. 
        - And I want you to keep that in your mind. Just a minute. Okay.
        - um so yeah i'm to so to bring us all to you and your your your responses were great and I love, how you guys saw more about it and added an extra sentence to it.
        - I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer. I mean, I think also Chris's answer. I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff. That was pretty good.
        - Raise your hand if you have questions about what you're supposed to do right now.
        - Oh no, it's not anything like that, I'm sure you all have your own great knowledge of space. We're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage. Do you guys remember the passage about water on the moon?
        - I brought you here because I would love to discuss with you, your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon, yes Luis.
        - Well, I was thinking about another meaning of the word value like I'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money. So I was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money.
        - Well, I didn't work with a partner, yet I just rewrote it and I found that they talked about a machine.
        - yeah I can see make sense.
        - You guys have any questions?
        - Very in range of responses. Some of y'all kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off. 
        - Um, so I said that scientists found craters full of water.
        - Well, it's always good to go back and review things that you've learned
        - I think the most important equipment was the microscope.
        - And, based on the responses that each of you provided, I do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon, and about water on the moon that sound okay.
        - Alright friends. Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text. So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers. Okay.
        - I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. Actually, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why I'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question. Um, so thank you so much.
        - Okay, well I pulled you aside because me as the teacher. I saw that maybe we could all help each other, get a deeper understanding of space.
        - That makes sense.
        - I guess.
        - Well, that makes the response more complete, I guess, in a way.
        - Alright, let's just let's use the same approach we used for Farrah, and then answer.
        - You understand that.
        - You get it?
        - I know you guys all know all about space, but I just want to make sure that you're capturing the reading and the question clearly OK.
        - You ready?
        - Does anyone else have any other questions to clarify this response.
        - Okay yeah.
        - Are you ready to be a reading detective.
        - Alright, everyone, so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question, right now, so I want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question, to see if we can all come to an understanding yes Luis.
        - And while you reread that Luis out i'll move on to Jazmin .
        - Can you guys do that.
        - hi Farrah and Jen and Chris and Jazmin he said i'm excited to talk to you today, we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so Chris Oh yes, even What would you like to say.
        - So let's talk about your answers you already read the article. The moon and we are going to share our answers. 
        - Alright, so does anybody have any confusion about what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - Well we're still going to go through the rest of everybody else's So if you could help us like us, are thinking and pay attention to the other folks is they waited for you, that would be really great.
        - um yeah so we read it, we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - So we did look through paragraph two,
        - And the Lunar Orbiter?
        - There's always things you can learn
        - awesome it's great to see you guys, so you guys just read that article write about water on the moon.
        - Yeah, it's me, Luis. Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.
        - Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA. And you can connect that with what you are learning. Thank you for sharing that. Okay.
        - Great, great, great answer. So Luis Do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer?
        - Excuse me, I'm a teacher, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - yeah yeah it does so, so, then I, my answer is right, I just. Wait actually what was wrong with my answer, because you, you said that I did good because I answered the question and I said yes.
        - So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?
        - Well, craters craters are really big.
        - Okay, I want you all to look at your at your you Oh, do you have that question in front of you.
        - So maybe if we kind of glue all of this, together, we can come up with a clear answer so, can you raise your hand if you said no, that the water on the moon is not valuable.
        - Well, the first three paragraphs, the answers in there somewhere, 
        - OK now i'm going to go through each of you individually, but before I do that, I want you guys to do something first okay.
        - Um Actually teacher Oh, something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch.
        - Yeah, I think that's a little clearer.
        - Again, just make sure you have all those pieces. Yes, Jazmin. I'm sorry. I see your hand. What's up,
        - sure when and remember this is not really a group for who knows about space and who doesn't this is more just, have we written an answer that completely answers this question.
        - Okay does anyone else have any questions before we get started.
        - So i'm gonna go one by one and give you each some feedback on what you said to the response. i'll start with Farrah.
        - Sometimes it is if you listen to the question.
        - Okay, awesome. So let's take a quick look at our responses.
        - Okay that's fine great.
        - Okay well we'll start with Jazmin and then we'll come to you how does that sound.
        - But now we're going to go a little bit deeper into the text and really think about
        - Do you understand the difference.
        - Okay. Does anyone have any questions.
        - yeah so about the equipment, I was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it. But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more. And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space. Okay.
        - So, have you found your answer.
        - Awesome. So today in our small group, we are going to be discussing our reading that we did have about water on the moon.
        - um excuse me. I I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - yeah I think so, what do you think.
        - Does that help.
        - That sounds okay.
        - I watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog, and he's always investigating crimes. 
        - That makes sense? Good.
        - And just for a second, let's examine what Farrah and Oliver just said. 
        - I'm still a little confused, actually.
        - yeah. yeah so basically
        - Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article. 
        - Does that make sense to you.
        - Alright, so I was hearing some really great discussions on being said and I just want to focus on your responses individually.
        - I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good.
        - Oh, that's wonderful to have your background knowledge. I just want to make sure that everybody understands this text. This particular text okay by this author
        - Okay, yeah, I can stick around.
        - So that makes sense?
        - We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it.
        -  Oh yeah well I sort of like Farrah it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and I really want to go and see it one day.
        - Okay, yeah. Good for him.
        - Okay, yeah, I'll look for all look for some new stuff.
        - So I'm Chris or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer.
        - Hello Everyone, I know when we are working on. Our tasks in discussions with water on the moon. And I know we are gonna dive into what we read. 
        - we're gonna figure it out together.
        - Does anyone else, want to add into it or thought that they saw something interesting in the reading yes.
        - I mean well I know a lot about space.
        - All right. Okay.
        - I think, so let me look back at.
        - does that sound right.
        - Well, that's okay. It doesn't hurt to learn a little more right
        - um well there's always room to grow for everyone when answering a question or doing an assignment, so, for your answer.
        - Does anyone else have questions.
        - So I know that we just read the article water on the moon. And you guys were supposed to answer a question right
        - That was a really good thing to        - if I asked about anything you needed to go to the moon, that would be a great part of your response. But do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer?
        - does that answer questions the one.
        - Oh no, it's great. We're going to get together and think about how we can read even further. To find out more information about our answers. So that's why we're here thinking about when we're reading by ourselves.
        - So does anyone else have anything that they were confused about?
        - um do you all have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon.
        - Um, cuz yeah well I mean yeah cuz well when you said okay, you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe. So, yeah, yeah. Okay.
        - Well basically I wrote the same thing as Farrah.
        - Okay. They use the Lunar Orbiter to um, they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water and then I use the microscope to look at the water
        - Um, yeah. Um, so they, it was the, they sent like a microscope and something else?
        - Excuse me. Um, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Does that help?
        - Okay, so to start off everyone had a great start answering the questions um.
        - And they all had great information in them, I just pulled you aside, because I think we can each Dave a little deeper Okay, yes Luis excuse me.
        - All right. Um, Farrah and Oliver. Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer.
        - You guys see that?
        - stick with us and let's see what we can learn from each other as well.
        - uh huh because.
        - It is cool. So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers.
        - Okay Thank you everyone for sharing i'm going to ask you to think a little about your answers and i'm going to ask for a little more detail from each of you.
        - Do you understand?
        - Alright, so I heard some great ideas from the class. Thank you all for sharing. Why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah. So I saw some        - actually before we get there, Luis you have a hand up. Do you have a question for me?
        - We're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from. 
        - I think so, um, you know what I just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say
        - So we do we all agree that The main point of the first paragraph is that there's water in craters on the moon.
        - Does that makes sense Jazmin?
        - No, I think that sounds good.
        - Well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and I noticed some very interesting patterns, so the aim of our discussion today is to Oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah Luis you have a question.
        - Very good. So what did we, what did we look at and very closely. 
        - So maybe you can learn something here and maybe we can help you to improve your knowledge or maybe you can help us to enter or knowledge or knowledge. Okay.
        - yeah I got it now. I can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks.
        - That's right. So remember back to our question. We just have to find convincing evidence for its value. And like you said, we've done that. Right. We have tons of ways that it can be used.
        - Does that make sense?
        - Well Okay, I think I did what what Oliver and Farrah didn't do is I answered the question I said yes, and then I also did the thing, where I I I pulled the evidence from the text, so I guess I don't know why mine is wrong.
        - Stick around. Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers. 
        - Does anybody else have any questions.
        - I'm sorry. I looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - you guys just finished reading water on the moon. I noticed that. And I also noticed that you guys tended to have some answers that weren't thought about as best as I think you guys can think about. I think you guys can come up with better
        - yeah the Lunar orbiter.
        - I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody. See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence. Does that sound good.
        - Everyone so after reading all your answers.
        - You all feel very strongly towards the question of whether they would be or there wouldn't be and it seems that there is a divide between the yes and the no.
        - In a group of small, a smaller group, instead of our whole entire class as one.
        - How's it going,
        - and see how it kind of thinking more on that helped you figure that out.
        - No, I do. I do remember, um, I thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters. Um, but I did have a quick question.
        - Still kind of confused.
        - I wanted to work with you three to look a little bit further into the question.
        - I just I just was wondering like, I didn't. I wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong. 
        - And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow 
        - That we recently did over water on the moon. Yes, Luis. 
        - Okay, so you are ready, you have the knowledge of ready. Okay, so tell me about it. I want to know. After reading these these lecture, I want you to
        - Yeah, I'm not sure. It's just that I didn't say enough?
        - So I hope that we can modify. I hope that we can change our answers. After reading the text because now we have sources of evidence. 
        - so and you guys had varying levels of understanding
        - Ok, everyone's done?
        - Okay, but um and I appreciate that you know so much about this, but at the same time, we can always learn more. So why don't you stick with us and we'll see what we can discover together.
        - Okay, so I want everyone to come back to class for a second. Come back into group.
        - Does that make more sense of how what I wanted from you, Jazmin.
        - that's okay Luis because we're revising our answers and we're all learning today. So I appreciate you sharing that. It's okay, you can be in our group.
        - um yeah Teacher I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - yeah totally so let's let's dig into that now.
        - Hmm. Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space. Okay. But we're all in this group to work on answering some questions. Alright.
        - That's so important because what does that tell me
        - Ah, yeah, I see it. I have a quick question, though.
        - yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment  I think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong.
        - Nice to see you too. So today, we can do something really fun in this small group, we're going to be reading detectives. Okay, so I need us all.
        - hi everyone so today we're going to be looking at questions from our readings. Everyone know what I'm talking about?
        - As I mentioned, I learned from you guys every day so we're here to work together to just deepen all of our understandings on the text.
        - Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples.
        -  Do you understand
        - That's great. But I think that all the time. We can learn something new.
        - yeah yeah I was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before, but also, I just looked at the clock and.
        - Well, you are right, but I also just want you to be able to you know, see the bigger picture and kind of say that was one part of the equipment, but.
        - yeah yeah yeah yeah I think.
        - Do you guys see that?
        - Very good. So we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to all of you. And one thing that I want to tell all of you guys about this question. Yes. Luis
        - Well, actually I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Well, we're all here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text. So I think that we all have a reason to be here together. So, just listen to what I have to say, please.
        - anyone else take anything from the text that was the main idea, but anything anyone else notice anything or think anything was cool.
        - Guys, you know, I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Great fantastic so you just read water on the moon.
        - Okay, so everybody had such great ideas and responses to the question and I loved hearing everybody's.
        - Chris, so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you.
        - Yes, you did a great job on that we are just wanting to I'm just pulling people together, just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question. So we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers.
        - that's a good plan yeah.
        - It says in the reading that you need NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So the lunar orbiter must be this small machine. 
        - How does that sound.
        - Correct?
        - What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?
        - And you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece.
        - Thank you Luis and we got that straight from the text where Jazmin just read, for us. So now we have microscope and lunar orbiter. Jazmin was really nice and that she respectfully disagree disagree dwith Farrah and Oliver.
        - You too. Okay, so today we are talking about our article that we read about water on the moon. And I see that you've all answered your questions here. 
        - Oh, oh, OK.
        - What else do you remember from the article.
        - That supported the question and I do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good. 
        - All yeah I sure can she said that on the
        -  Does that make sense?
        - And we're going to continue yeah definitely I really like it we're going to continue talking about legos as a way to help us understand what we're talking about in this article so Farrah what's the difference i'm sorry did somebody say something.
        - yeah yeah it did okay I bought my answer, I did all pull some information from the text.
        - And that's why me and Jazmin just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure Jazmin understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so Luis Do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did.
        - So okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text. Sound good Luis.
        - Okay, does anybody else have any questions before we begin,
        - Yeah, no problem. Um, so basically I was just saying that like I kind of know like all about space. So I don't think I really need to be in this
        - Alright, so hi class, so I pulled the five of you aside just because I wanted to take a closer look at our answers to the first question for this reading
        - I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - but we are talking about the moon specifically today and I just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we all understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good.
        - Yes, and that's how they found the water on there right. 
        - Yes. Good. Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer. 
        - So I'm going to give you a minute to go back and read
        - OK, I see two hands two hands awesome okay you can put your hands down. if you think it is the microscope raise your hand.
        - There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers.
        - I'm seeing some nods. Well done. All right, let's move on to the second paragraph.
        - You know a lot about space. Well, I'd love for you to stay and share some of your ideas with the other friends in our group, I think that would be
        - That make better sense?
        - Okay does anyone else have any questions.
        - i'm really excited to meet you guys too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher, so I thought this was super cool did you guys read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage.
        - Yeah, we talked about, we use a microscope in science class.
        - I just want to hear your takeaways and reflections.
        - So today we're going to be reviewing
        - Um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the Lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, the small machine.
        - Nah but I'm ok. 
        - If you think it's the Lunar orbiter raise your hand.
        - I loved your guys responses looking at it.
        - So we, we read the text. Did everybody understand the text water on the moon.
        - Okay, I got it.
        - but I believe we've had just a little bit of misunderstanding. Does that make sense, just a little bit. We can easily
        - Okay. Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers.
        - hi everyone, so I really appreciate you all, giving your responses to our second discussion question which was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable, so I want to just talk through each of your responses.
        - um yeah but I did that. Um the first part, the first sentence in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine.
        - That make sense?
        - who thinks that this is answering the question being asked raise your hand.
        - does anyone have any questions.
        - Um, I'm not. I think I'm still not sure about because I have the same answer as Farrah
        - yeah well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - i'm your teacher and i'm excited to talk to you today meet for a little bit to discuss what we all just read from water on the moon, which is pretty exciting hi yes Luis you have a question.
        - So um did you all read the text about water on the moon?
        - You know what then we can actually just build on your background knowledge in your understanding that you already have, I think it's great that you already know a lot about space, but it's really important to build on that knowledge.
        - All right does anyone, excuse me does anyone else have any other questions.
        - hi class so i'm Mr Z and you guys are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and all here to answer any questions, yes.
        - To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have
        - Does that makes sense.
        - Okay um so yeah I think the one thing I noticed when I was looking at our answers to today's questions is that I think we've got a little bit of room to expand our understanding of the text.
        - So the answer is just both.
        - that's a really good point anything I think that's a great explanation does that make sense.
        - Does anyone else have questions on the passage?
        - That clear?
        - awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is Teacher you can call me Teacher if you'd like um and I wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you guys read yes Luis.
        - Okay. Um, so yeah. Um, there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here. Um, so, in paragraph two, they talk about the Lunar Orbiter and then paragraph three, they talk about the microscope so
        - I'm good. So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you guys about your answers that you guys put For question number one. Yes. Luis
        - Thank you Chris. Anyone disagree or want to push back on that? Or we all agree that these two words can be used as synonyms?
        -  yeah.
        - We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say. And when you said a small machine. We were able to clarify that. That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information. That makes sense? Okay.
        - we're gonna we're going to really dig deep into more detail and get you will get a good understanding of the text.
        - does anyone else have any other questions.
        - um, how can, how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope.
        - Um, yeah, and I want you answered our questions. So I'm not even sure why why we're in this group.
        - Yeah, yeah. I understand it better now.
        - Yeah, you got it?
        - they're still lots that we can learn from this passage, I promise, so if we could all just look
        - yeah awesome Thank you so much, and we know that the moon is kind of one big rock so it seems like there's a lot of geology that's going to happen going on in the moon, huh?
        - And since we're in a small group we're supposed to discuss it here for next time. I just want you to look closer at the text.
        - Yeah, so do you remember what I said to Farrah?
        - Well, I want us to work on how we answer the questions, not necessarily the information we already know about the water on the moon um but just how we answer the question okay.
        -  You guys read the the article about water on the moon, is that correct?
        -  And we want to make sure that we're using everything to answer the questions.
        - So i've just been reading your responses and I wanted to pull you guys into a smaller group, because I feel like we can all do a little bit of improving on our responses and that's Okay, yes Luis excuse me.
        - OK, raise your hand when you're finished.
        - I hear that you guys have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart. Everybody's answer. 
        - raise your hands when you're all done reading okay.
        - That feels like a really thorough answer to me, does it feel like a thorough answer to you.
        -  yeah sounds good.
        - yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now.
        - Well i'm glad that you're really interested in space, and I think that being a part of this group you'll learn from your.
        - Yes. And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today. Okay.
        - Okay and Farrah. I just wanted to touch back with you and Oliver. I know you had the same answer is Farrah. Are you guys feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text, Mr Oliver
        - yeah so Oliver it's so important in this space for us to know that everyone is doing their own thinking, and I know that you have such a valuable thinking to offer in this space.
        - yeah I think so.
        - because I know you have really good words and you can use them and you're able to tell them I know you can tell me
        - that's interesting thing to say. I don't think even science, all like scientists that have studied space for years know everything about space.
        - The actual answer that we're looking for right.
        - Oliver. Do you remember that question from yesterday.
        - i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why I felt like we should all be talking together in a small group to learn from each other, does that sound okay.
        - I guess I'll
        - yeah well, we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch.
        - If you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment, we can come back to you and I can move on to Chris again.
        - So, anyone else have any other questions.
        - So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff. That's okay.
        - yeah I think so, so we just have to say, both of the names of the equipment in our answer.
        - Um, well,I guess I didn't know because you had
        - We believe that we're understanding everything I just want to make sure that is clarified among everyone okay.
        - Alright, so I believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry Luis, how can I help you.
        - Put your hand up if you have it in front of you just do a check to make sure you have your article and a pencil or pen or something to mark up to put your hand up if you have that. OK, I see four hands. Okay. Jazmin. Great. Good. This is early in the morning and
        - I think we can push it a little more 
        - Okay, Jazmin, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and Farrah.
        - Can I get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay.
        - But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too.
        -  um but after after hearing them, I think that some might be too specific and some may be too general, I think that you're all just slightly off. Luis.
        - Perfect. Okay. So what other. Does anyone have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment.
        - and we can help each other by doing that, by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer.
        - Okay, does that make more sense?
        - Oh yeah it's Chris, I don't really have a question about the microscope, but I have another question. Um, should I save it?
        - So, at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail, yes Chris.
        - i'm so pleased to work with you today, I always learned so much from each of you, so I wanted to let you know, so why we're here so based on the responses and I i've identified some areas that I think that we can revisit The text together to just really strengthen our understanding.
        - Okay so Oliver. Can you summarize what Farrah just said for me?
        - We read it already.
        - that's a very interesting question does anyone else have any questions or comments related to the question about what we were reading.
        - yeah yeah I guess.
        - Did you have the chance...
        - Do you understand what I mean?
        - Okay, I guess it's not a question.
        - Excuse me teacher, but I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Huh, yeah. I sometimes everybody is just in groups to kind of talk more about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong. 
        - Just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking. okay? um so i've heard, so I'm going to review your responses out loud. This is what I've heard. 
        - Okay. Okay, I'm gonna read it and see.
        - uh huh okay.
        - Better responses to the question that I'm asking because I know you guys are super smart and you can do that. All right.
        - Oh, I think so um but I guess um I don't know how I would have picked that I think I think I still I still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two.
        - hey guys so listening to your answers lots of them were very great really proud of you guys, I just have a couple of questions.
        - Okay, so, and here I put it. Put your hands up and just show me that you can all see the question at the top of your paper.
        - Think we all should be here. I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question. So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood. Does that make sense?
        - Great i'm really glad to hear that so we're going to talk a little bit more about this and ways that we can go even deeper into our text. 
        - I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be on this group, I am already know all about space.
        - Um, yeah, I have a quick question. Um, so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question, how did scientists, or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're all here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually, but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers. Just a little bit. Yes. Luis
        - um yeah Mr see I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Yeah, Chris or Oliver. Do you have questions?
        - Yeah, I guess, I guess. So I feel like, oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at
        - All right, i'm going to count and then i'll let you guys know and time's up okay.
        - Well, I need a two on underline just equipment right.
        - Excellent they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it. Oliver, you said the same exact thing as Farrah. Does that make a little more sense to you?
        - Yeah, I do too. That's our we're gonna all talk a little bit more about this so that we can keep learning
        - And Farrah. The same thing discovers like a verb. We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered 
        - Um, anyone, anyone else have any questions before we start? Alright, sounds good. Sounds good. 
        - yeah well i'm I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - yeah because you guys were right on the right track, we just had to make that one little jump.
        - Well, I guess.
        - My name is Teacher, and today I'm going to be helping you with our comprehension questions from the text that we read about the moon.
        - Very good amazing OK, so now that we have a fair idea of what equipment means let's try to read let's try to figure out the answer this question in context um so before that that me.
        - Yeah we we all answered it. And, um, we told you, our answers. And then, um, you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers.
        - Well, let's double check our answers. That way we know for sure that we have answered the question. The way that it's asking us to. OK.
        - teacher Okay, I think I got this all figured out now so i'm all good.
        - Okay okay okay. 
        - So, again it's not that your answers necessarily right or wrong there's always a way to make something better though right so let's take a look actually your is end of.
        - Um no I didn't take a look yet.
        - I have to, I have to write more stuff in my answer.
        - Farrah do you understand 
        - okay any questions before I say go.
        - it's not that question, but I was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon, and so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Great. Are there any more questions.
        -  On yeah i'm confused too because, while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and I don't know what the right answer is.
        - And I want to just go over a couple of your answers.
        - And so I'm going to pull back up your responses.
        - Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah Farrah.
        - So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments. Okay, Farrah, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer. 
        - Okay. It does. It was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and I circled the last sentence too.
        - Great so I know you guys had a good mix of answers which is really good because it actually helps us get down to the root of.
        - Right we have this knowledge in our brain. And then we have this stuff on the text. 
        - Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done.
        - Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
        - What they use to look at it was microscopic does that makes sense
        - Sorry.
        - So we were we were investigating the water on the moon text. First, I want to ask you guys. Did you guys enjoy this test, did you learn anything from it, Luis. Go ahead.
        - And can we find one more example because I want us to be prepared to re answer this question and in complete sentences, to the best of our ability and finishing our thoughts.
        - um so did all if you read the other three passages, but for the moon, is a desert.
        - But but let's go back to talking about the Lunar orbiter because I just thought that was so interesting.
        - um do you have any do you have any questions about that, so far, well, I just i'm gonna try to write it down, so I was trying to remember what you said.
        - So NASA to smell machine.
        - Hi. I'm Ms. [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today.
        - So do you understand how we could improve your answer?
        - and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words. Okay.
        - Oh come on stick around for a while, but you can learn something new from this, you know some i'm almost 20 years old, and I was reading some of this and I don't even know about it.
        - give a different answer.
        - So I like that we were thinking, did anyone else want to add something?
        - Is anybody else confused um I don't know if you guys can do, and I agree sign, but we that's that's what I do in real life so i'm Oliver.
        - Can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence.
        - yeah yeah That would be good.
        - I can go.
        - Well, we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz I I like how you you.
        - I'm good. Because I added more words.
        - That she's gotta say stuff in her own words. She can't just pull the quote from the story.
        - Right. Does that make sense Farrah?
        - Any other questions.
        - I don't see anybody raising their hand. This means that we understand what we need to do.
        - Uh-huh yeah I have it on my tablet right here.
        - yeah you do know a lot about space um and I don't want to say that this group is for people who don't know about space, because you all did a really good job, but this group is just to work on giving responses to questions from a text.
        - Okay, so a microscope it's something you look through, and when you look through it, it makes really tiny things on So you can see that.
        - I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to. I know a lot about equipment, but I didn't see that part.
        - so maybe you guys can take a look at that does that sound good.
        - Did you guys enjoy water on the moon.
        - You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any
        - Okay. So you hit you see it Farrah. Is it on your paper.
        -  So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one.
        - Does that make sense Chris yeah yeah.
        - Does that make sense
        - That work?
        - Alright, so can we look at some of the questions that you answered about what you've read about the moon?
        - Well, I'm sure because because I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - You understand why it's a microscope.
        - You were a lot about space right.
        - It does, I mean I just like don't like to write, you know I mean I feel like when I get the answer I got it and that's good.
        - So today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about NASA.
        - Okay. Um, yeah, it's cause it's cards. It comes first in the story.
        - Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I thought. That's kind of what I thought our first place that it was was most like that. The lunar orbiter. 
        - So we're all in this group together, just because I wanted to pull you guys and make sure that we all understand together and work through our answers together in a group so even if.
        - and then we're going to come back together and figure out a really strong answer as a group that answers the question completely sound good.
        - We I know that you can dig a little deeper than that I know you're smarter than that, and I know that you have more complete sentences that you can give me.
        - Okay? Does that make sense?
        - Oliver or Chris, I know you also had had your hands up was there, something that you either one of you wanted to share.
        - Very good. Jazmin. Thank you for sharing. So here, nobody is wrong or nobody is right, we're all going to learn together and we're going to explore
        - Ready when you have a new idea. You can raise your hand.
        - Okay let's talk about it, then what to do right Farrah.
        - Well that's great that you have some background knowledge, we're just going to build that in this group and expand your knowledge on the subject.
        - You you, you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that.
        - but I it just means that you need to look a little bit further into the reading yes.
        - Um, I mean, I guess. I mean, I guess, cuz you're you. You did tell me like I hear what you're saying. Like they sent I sent this Lunar Orbiter. Um, but what--
        - So while we're using space as a context for this actually our classes more about learning how to extract information from readings so it's more of a reading exercise, rather than a space exercise.
        - Good morning everybody        - I guess it's afternoon now! so you've all just shared your answers with me and they were awesome answers. I think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today. Yeah, Luis, I see you raise your hand, what can I help you with Luis?
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so my answer was, you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely.
        - hi everyone i'm so excited to meet you. My name is Teacher and i'm excited to be here. So we're talking about this article about water on the moon right?
        - RER: yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay.
        - is just a group to talk about the questions they don't mean anything specific.
        - Oh that's great and what did you think of it, oh yes Luis.
        - Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is.
        - I think that makes sense. Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses. And then we can kind of talk it through. Okay, so
        - Well, the good thing is, we can all learn some more from each other 
        - So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does
        - Is there anyone would want to add anything to our conversation? Yes Chris.
        - Okay, does that make sense.
        - Do you agree.
        - Because we chose to do a different piece of evidence.  And so your piece of evidence was just a little bit bigger. And so you just have to add on a little bit, little bit more than them. 
        - Um, saying more about why it would be valuable.
        - and revise our responses. 
        - yeah yeah it's right here.
        - Beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well.
        - To help us understand the context of the question, so now i'm going to read the question again and then we're going to keep what Farrah and Jazmin gave us um for us to understand the context of equipment.
        - Okay, okay. So we remember we read the text water on the moon. Remember reading that and digesting the text? So in the text. Remember we
        - Or need more clarification.
        - Reading the text is very important.
        - Well, that's OK because we'll all learn-        - all of us are learning anyway. So all of us are going to keep learning. So that's OK if you're in this group. You're going to join us, I'm happy for you to join us today. 
        - Yep. Okay. So we're looking over your responses. We're going to look back at the paragraph. I know that some of y'all had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper. And that's okay. Um,
        - Um yeah we all read it, but I I don't think I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Does anybody. Does anybody have any questions.
        - And you guys had some really great responses. I just want to talk to you about some of your responses. And let's see if we can dig a little deeper.
        - Yeah, we read that. 
        - That's good, that's good. Um, so you guys read a text water on the moon, and we're gonna be talking about what you said like your responses. 
        - So let's look back in our texts. And let's see if we had the best answer. Let's think about it.
        - Yeah, I think so. So like my answer wasn't quite right, but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water
        - Well, I guess the thing that I was thinking was kind of what Luis was saying before, I still have a question about it because I went to NASA with my dad.
        - Discover great. A lot of you are doing it. And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb. It's going to connect you back.
        - It's not so much a question, but remember how I was telling you about how I went to NASA with my dad? So yeah, I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too.
        - And I don't think you had. Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,
        - And we have a reading that I, I understand that you read it already. That is called the moon is a desert, right?
        - So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at
        - So I kind of was just well Okay, so I was thinking about that I went to NASA so I, like you were saying, I know that scientists use a lot of equipment.
        - So I see Farrah, and Oliver had the same answer. And I'm going to give all of you. Some targeted feedback to help you work on re answering this question, 
        - yeah so Luis we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis.
        - Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject. Okay, don't feel it's wrong. Thank you for for your input. 
        - All right, let's come back in 321.
        - Okay, well, I appreciate your thoughts, but i'm just going to ask that we keep listening and that maybe we'll find new knowledge okay so.
        - I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?
        - Yeah, yeah, okay, I can stick around for that.
        - I got my part in paragraph two, I just didn't say the name of the machine, but I had it.
        - Um, yeah, I think that we are getting more comfortable. Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But thank you so much for working with us.
        - Help us to understand this test, so we are going to get an answer, based on this test.
        - Great so do you Notice what Luis said?
        - Excuse me teacher, I don't think I should be in this group biology know all about space.
        - How Does everybody feel after you read that passage. Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused.
        - So let's.
        - So it's really nice to have you all in a small group together, I know you just read your passage on water on the moon. oh yes Luis.
        - Well, I can stick around.
        - Yeah, it does.
        - let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're all respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until I come to you Okay, unless you have a serious question.
        - And now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water, might it be valuable for our future scientists, Oliver go ahead yeah.
        - So we just read a little excerpt about the moon. Correct.
        - Mm hmm. Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn
        - Does everybody see that sentence.
        - Does anybody else have any questions about their answer.
        - Oh that's awesome we're going to really dive into this material and you're probably going to learn something you didn't already know you knew so we're going to still stay in this group and work together 
        - Is we can help each other and you can help me to kind of dig down into our article that's called close reading. Have you done close reading before
        - so i'm curious to hear some of the ideas that we've come up with to help explain why water might be valuable there on the moon.
        - Make sense?
        - Yeah, so I understand. And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer
        - Did anyone else have anything that they found very interesting? Oliver. 
        - So can anybody tell me what you guys were just reading about
        - Okay, let me look again so
        - I worked at NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - For the first question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. I want to talk about that question real quick, before, Before we go to lunch.
        - I think we're ready. I think we're ready to go.
        - Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text, 
        - Now, if all five of us can agree upon one response. Yes. Chris.
        - we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part.
        - So you're in this group because I wanted you all to kind of work together and hear each other's answers and kind of
        - So, not a problem um does anyone have any other questions about it.
        - Give you just a moment.
        - And when you're done, give me a thumbs up or raise your hand.
        - stop right there. Okay. So did everyone, did everyone read that with her.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in that spot. I already know all about space.
        - It's not always more, but I want you to be able to see where the evidence is coming from. Because then, I know that you know where the evidence is coming from.
        - Are we good to start.
        - Does that make sense? 
        - yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right.
        - Awesome. I'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you guys today.
        - Yes. Great, great. I'm sorry if that was a little confusing for you, but yes. Does that make a little more sense.
        - All of it, I think we can always learn more
        - You circled evidence in the text, you can use to answer the question.
        - Great, thank you for reading for us. Um Farrah. do you have more, a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now?
        - Do you see what I'm saying?
        - And I know some of you are totally see it as
        - I want to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to
        - I know that you know a lot about space and I'm happy that you can bring that knowledge with you. I just wanted to work with the three of you to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into this question.
        - Does that make a little more
        - Great and there's a second part to that question that says circle, do you see that part.
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Okay. Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use
        - Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more. 
        - So today we're going to be reading detectives.
        - So I guess it just it looks in the craters. Is that right?
        - Luis That's awesome. That you know so much about space, but we're going to expand our knowledge today as a group. Okay.
        - Oh, I, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots, um, lots and lots of different equipment.
        - So, Jazmin. You were looking at Chris's answer.
        - Does everyone have the article water on the moon pulled up on their tablet.
        - Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers.
        - Alright, so let's look at the question, right. And let's look at your answers. 
        - Alright, everyone, so we were working on our responses.
        - Oh that's Okay, because we're still revising our answers, and I know you had an answer to the questions. So that's okay, you're going to learn anyways, I appreciate you sharing that.
        - So I know where everybody is at learning. So I can help you guys further if you need it.
        - we want to make sure that you can combine the park, so you guys can all get the full answer does that make sense.
        - Okay, so let's continue reading through and seeing what else we found that we can add to our answers.
        - Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route.
        - So I want you to reread your answer that you gave And then raise your hand if you have any questions or if you think your answer is good or if you want to say something while your answer or ask why we're going to be really looking at your answer. So make sure it answers that question.
        - let's try to keep an open mind and Luis I feel you like this science stuff right i'm.
        - Does anybody else have any questions on why it is the microscope.
        - Oh, okay, I understand. I think that we can always learn from each other. And so I think we can. What you can do is look at the responses of your classmates and see if there's anything that you didn't know which would be really cool.
        - Do you understand that?
        - So, now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am.
        - Okay i've said that scientists found craters, full of water on the moon.
        - does that help.
        - yeah excuse me, I have all those, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - So Please go back and read it again and then find out something you may find something new.
        - All right, thank you so much, so what I wanted I want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering
        - When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for. And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event Jazmin, sorry.
        - Look everybody's ready.
        - So this one's a little tricky I feel so.
        - But do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water. Do you see the difference between that in the microscope?
        - Alright, so before we go back to her desk and just a moment let's make sure that we all come to agreement on a on a group answer okay.
        - Well, we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a group, come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay.
        - OK. I think I got it.
        - Okay Luis well, I think that we are all here to learn from each other we're all here to learn from the article.
        - Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def.
        - we're going to learn, even more so i'm sure you're in the right place.
        - High. So today we're going to be talking about water on the moon.
        - I just want to, uh, before I wrap it up. I just want to come together and see if someone can give me A refined answer from what the what everything we just talked about, like, another answer maybe building on the original answer that you had to the question.
        - You guys did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming.
        - I noticed from your small groups that you guys are talking about, you guys are looking.
        - Okay, so we're going to continue right where we left off, Farrah. Did you go back to your texts and reread paragraphs one and two?
        - Does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused.
        -  we are going to try to go a little bit deeper into our text today.
        - Exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer. Cuz you answered it.
        - So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right.
        - I think you guys have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there. Yes. Luis
        - Well, you know what it's actually really important to foster collaboration and listen to our peers responses to help build on what you already know. 
        - Do you know how you could have. I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Correct?
        - Well, some of us are right and some of us are wrong? 
        - So you're saying like, because it's, um, it's not in the story.
        - Let's see. I'm going to look at your responses, real quick.
        - In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there. So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to
        - On yes, we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them.
        - That make more sense.
        - what do you think.
        - Why should we look for you worked with Jazmin and Luis right?
        - So I know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right.
        - Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding.
        - Well, that I mean we all have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about, but I just want to make 100% I just want to be 100% clear that we all have gotten it and understood it.
        - So let's do that for another minute.
        - Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter. Does that make sense now.
        - Well, we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so, even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us, and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right Luis.
        - Did you read that Farrah with her? Okay. Chris, id you read that you. 
        - All right. It shouldn't take too long. If there's just a double, double check that you understand what I want you to understand. Okay.
        - I mean, I know stuff about speaks to like Luis I went to NASA. So I know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits, but I just don't know which equipment they use to, to, to find the water or, I guess, discover water on the moon.
        - Does that make sense. Do you see that
        - Luis why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say, and maybe we can learn some new things.
        - OK. OK. Yeah.
        - So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to
        - And Farrah the reasons why we wanted to in this group, so that you can bring your expertise to talk about that microscope for us okay.
        - So let's look deeper into that Luis. 
        - Here this is Chris. I thought it was really cool that scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Alright, are we ready to go around and discuss a little bit more about what we read. Awesome. Okay, so, Farrah and Oliver. I'm going to start with you guys. Okay.
        - Do you understand what I'm saying.
        - That sounds great yeah let's do it.
        - that's funny I have heard about that I heard about that, on the news so that's great that you know something about Pluto I think today we'll talk a little bit about water on the moon, because that's what we read about in our article.
        - Everyone takes their own pace. 
        - Alright, students, so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon, and I think we need to        - yes Luis.
        - so you all have some really great answers, but I want to dig into them a little further.
        - I just have to add called lunar orbiter?
        - Yes, we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers.
        - That he gave us. So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more. 
        - You do Luis You absolutely do. And your answer was so good that I think we can make it even better. Are you willing to be flexible and think with me.
        - So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers.
        - Oh yeah I guess.
        - Any other questions as we're updating our answers.
        - That sounds great.
        - Yeah, I guess, you know, how do you find them?
        - yeah so like I should make sure that I, I guess, like look closely at the reading is, that is, that is, that right?
        - Does that answer your question, Luis.
        - Okay, well, I don't know why mine was wrong, because, I mean, I know, I know a lot about space. And so I know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon. They can't breathe.
        - Does anyone else have any more questions.
        - All right. So you've all shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question. So the question is asking us
        - Um, oh, I guess, okay.
        - Oh no, I can see it. Um, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Well, I mean, it says that they look at the water with a microscope. That's equipment, um,
        - Does that kind of make more sense about where you're kind of going and what we're looking for with the question?
        - I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits
        - Does that sound okay.
        - Oh yeah that's great um so Luis i'm glad you're here because we're gonna be talking a lot about space, this is not a group for people that don't know about space, this is a group for people that are excited to learn more about space.
        - Someone to explain a little bit more on what they were reading about or what they thought was interesting. 
        - Chris. Do you not remember reading that part.
        - Luis I'm sure you do. And there's always more room for us to learn more about space which is exactly why we're here today. I've been reading over your answers and I wanted us to take a second look at this text to see if there's any to see if we can make our responses. Even better.
        - Yes, excuse me.
        - you can look over what you have and then we're going to come back together and we're going to answer the question.
        - And so, in our first question we were talking about different types of equipment scientists use you all seem to know a little bit about that now.
        - Always you guys want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though, if you agree, or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions.
        - hi everyone okay so we're going to keep talking about equipment 
        - yeah yeah I think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said.
        - Right. So you have some background knowledge. So let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment. Okay.
        - That is pretty cool. You'll have to go home and show him this article. Once we've talked about it some more, um,
        - Oh well, actually I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now.
        - If you guys have any questions at any point, you can just raise your hand and I can answer.
        - the microscope. Good job. Farrah. So does everybody understand?
        - Thank you. So that's good. That's an area we can improve. And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so Chris. What was the Oh, pardon me, Chris, Farrah. Yes, question.
        - Is the answer in there, or is that just a partial answer in there. What do you guys believe what do you think Farrah, and Oliver?
        - I see that it's almost time for us to go, but I am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet, but i'm like Chris said, like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon, then they could
        - All of you have done an excellent job and I know that you all are great thinkers, I think that we can work a little bit harder to make your answers the absolute best you can. Do you have a question.
        - Well, um, I mean, I think that I had the right answer. So, um, I guess. I don't know why my answers wrong, too.
        - It's not so much confused, but I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - i'm still a little confused cuz I said the same as Farrah. I said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the Lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how I would how I would have picked that on my own. I think I would still pick the microscope.
        - I think so. I think
        - I think you may still be confused Farrah. Right. 
        - By.
        - Yeah, like why that's not like the answer.
        - um yeah I you know I really got this figured out I think I'm all good.
        - Exactly, these are all great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on 
        - Oh, OK. So then my one about-        - let me see. What did I-        - I know I circled a part of the story. Oh, yes. OK, so I said--
        - um However, I think that some some mistakes that I saw across the board in some answers, or maybe not some mistakes, but just some places that everybody can work on um I believe.
        - Oliver and Luis. Does that help clarify that question.
        - So what we are going to do first is to work, individually and then we will go into free discussion and some elbow exchange.
        - um oh okay yeah there are this circle, the evidence and the text where Oh, that we can use to answer this question.
        - Who told you that, that's not true. I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art. 
        - But we are just going back over this question, we want to get as much out of this text as possible, even if you already know all about space.
        - Thank you for asking. Luis. Then I'm going to work with you.
        - About about water on the moon.
        - Well, so do own to talk about the question.
        - do you guys have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by Farrah and Oliver that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before?
        - So we are going to think a little bit. Yes?
        - But I just want to talk with you guys a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that everyone understands the water on the moon text.
        - Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response. Yes. Luis
        - You think you could do that?
        - So I think that um do you guys want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses all that yeah def.
        - Yeah, thank you.
        - does that make sense Farrah.
        - With you up me
        - That's right. What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?
        - Do you see how there could be some confusion there.
        - I think we're ready.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already corrected my answer.
        - So would you think that would be a form of equipment used by NASA?
        - Alright, so you have all shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here. Yes. Luis
        - All right, what do we think do we think that investigating is a similar kind of thing to discovering.
        - So to start, I'm so glad you're here today. We're all here today to help each other and we need to have some materials ready. So I wanted to ask you.
        - And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you guys share with me your responses on the question. 
        - Right, you find something. Do you agree with that everybody
        - Well, it was about how they found water. The phone craters are full of water on the moon.
        - When you're ready, you can raise your hand.
        - Good. Awesome job. Awesome. Alright, so, um, we remember the other day, we read the text water on the moon. Do we remember reading that. Yeah. Awesome. So the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses. Everybody did a great job. Yeah. Yeah. Luis
        - that's awesome well I bet there are a few things that you don't know so i'm excited as you grow your learning today.
        - Orbiter
        - yeah I think so too i'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about this text today because i'm a science teacher, so I thought this article was really, really interesting so let's dig in a little bit to our question today.
        - Um, excuse me. Um, I shouldn't be ni this group. I already know all there is to know about space.
        - Alright so this event and Divya What do y'all think is all kind of had the same answer. 
        - Reach Every Reader:It's me Oliver
        - Yeah definitely writing more and reading very close in the text and looking for because that was a very small piece of information that was very easy to skim over
        - And it can help you learn it better, as well, so i'd like to thank you guys for taking the time to answer the questions as well, oh.
        - yeah okay i'll i'll stick around.
        - oh how's that sound?
        - I guess. Ever since you were. We were talking, I was just wonder, like, I guess. Still not sure like my, my answer.
        - You already know all about space. Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new. Okay. 
        - I'm excited to work with you guys. So I looked over all of your answers for the question. And I wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers. 
        - Is the answer to the Lunar orbiter.
        - Is that clear.
        - So have you guys already read the text.
        - Alright. Are we all set, or do we need more time.
        - Whoa, okay. So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them. So, that's okay. Chris, it's totally okay when you just        - 
        - so make sense Luis?
        - Awesome. Does anyone else have any questions about their responses?
        - Let's great Luis Maybe you can share some
        - Yeah, because a machine is equipment.
        - Some ideas with us about the article.
        - that's really fascinating and makes me think that maybe sometime later, we should have a discussion about.
        - answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question. 
        - Does that make sense. Is that a little easier.
        - and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you, yes or now.
        - It seems that there's a little bit of confusion.
        - Reading. My name is Teacher, so we're going to be digging a little bit deeper into our discussion questions on reading about water on the moon.
        - Yeah. And then I noticed that you put the same answer as Farrah. So does that make sense to you. Also, buddy.
        -  Not yet i'm i right now. I mean, I know what the microscope is a tool.
        - So, let's look. Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?
        - Hi class, so I just got through looking over your responses and I just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so Farrah look at yours again.
        - Excuse me, but I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So you're saying if Farrah has the same answer as me, then I should try to find a different answer?
        - Oh, I don't understand why my answer is still wrong.
        - Yeah, yeah. Because I went to NASA with my dad, so I do know about the Mars Rover and other things, too.
        - You on musk such a card all right let's come back to this question up front right so everyone sort of has different answers.
        - Okay, so we've all had some responses and I want to talk about them a little bit more.
        - um yeah okay yeah.
        - Um, well, I also sent them microscope like Oliver and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Hi guys, so I liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text, but I brought us all together, just because some of us.
        - I mean ask me anything I know I know everything that I need to know.
        - Great. I have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon.
        - Tell me what was this article about
        - Can anybody tell me what this article was about
        - There's there's tools we can use to find out even more when we're interested in, in an answer. So that's what we're here today and it's good that there's a small group.
        - Alright guys let's come back together now and let's share let's share the words that we chose in our groups.
        - Oh yeah, well, I was thinking, like, how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it.
        - All right, well, Luis. Why don't you stick with us.
        - Does anyone else have any questions or confused about anything?
        - So specificity.
        - Um, yeah, you said that I was right on when I was talking about the water, but I didn't talk about the equipment. Right.
        - We just want to be able to give the best answer.
        - So you guys just got done with reading the moon, is a desert.
        - So I agree that you did it correct your answer and I think we're really on the right track, but what I want to talk about right now.
        - I don't think even scientists like scientists that have been studying space their whole lives know all about space. Space is so big.
        - Is anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys.
        - Does everyone understand now.
        - Yeah, I guess so.
        - um yeah I I could see that yeah I could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet.
        - To find information within the text. Can you all do that.
        - hi alright, so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article, we read about NASA would anyone like yeah Luis.
        - Is that makes sense.
        - Do you all have your article and some cut something to market mark on it with
        - So you might also help us be able to think a little bit deeper.
        - Okay, so we will also talk about it later. Okay, so in the beginning, I just wanted to know if you have the main ideas, clear and then we can talk more about it. Okay.
        - So you all read water on the moon. Right.
        - I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Yeah, we all, we all took some time and we read it again.
        - I think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more.
        - But I'm glad you're here today. And we've been reading some exciting news about water being discovered on the moon, of all places, right.
        - I've read your answers. And I want to get a couple of clarifying questions have for you. So let's start with Jazmin. Okay. Yes. Luis
        -  So I think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that Luis.
        - Oh yeah, that sounds great. And I think that we all feel really confident now that you said that. Thank you so much. Alright.
        - How did we enjoy that text, the water on the moon.
        - For number one the first task you have two minutes and for number two. The second task you have two minutes. Okay.
        - Oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is Teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback... i'm here to give you the feedback that, for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin, are you guys ready to begin?
        - So I wanted to let you know that I brought you into the group because there's always opportunity for us to grow our understandings of a topic, even if we know a lot about them.
        - yeah so let's let's keep talking about it so.
        - So if nobody has any other equipment. Let's, let's look at those two
        - Alright, so guys you did really well with your response and I'm with the text, but I have a couple questions when to help us further our knowledge and understanding of the texts. Are you guys ready
        - Okay, so, while you work on that i'm going to go ahead and move to our other friends does that sound good Jazmin or do you have any questions.
        - Excuse me, I don't, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Great. Well, so do you guys had an opportunity to review the discussion question?
        - Too much there's always more that you can learn.
        - Most of you have an answer.
        - Yes, I did.
        - Does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked.
        - So Oliver does that make sense to you too?
        - You got it now, Luis?
        - Yes, water on the moon. Did you guys enjoy the reading.
        - And you think you've got it out. So there were some room for
        - Alright, so I would like all five of you to take your papers out and have it in front of you, because we're going to be using highlighters and the pages.
        - Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it. Okay, so she brought up.
        - That makes sense?
        - yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more.
        - Okay and Luis So you have read the text right the text that is water on the moon?
        - So I have to find the equipment in the story.
        -  Does that make sense.
        - So today I would like to go over some of the questions. Two questions that you guys have answered.
        - Yeah, I can't
        - So continue from where we left off. I'm gonna keep talking to Jazmin.
        - Um, yeah, I'm looking right now. Did you want me to give the answer.
        - So you guys have already came up with an answer to this question.
        - Everybody understand?
        - But then your answer is gonna be awesome. You can do it, I believe you can do it. 
        - Okay. Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there. 
        - Oh well, I just was off, I was gonna say that, like, I think I got everything figured out now, so I think i'm all good to go.
        - Now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a group discussion of your responses to see whether or not you guys can figure out like which yeah, of course, Luis.
        - Um, yeah, okay.
        - It's good to see you, too. I'm Teacher and I'm going to go over this question based on the text that we read
        - Okay sounds good, well, maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound Okay, so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right.
        - So does everyone understand that now from the passage?
        - So Oliver are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better.
        - So do you think all of you have a clear answer now, do you think our response has evolved to we can Can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement.
        - And i'm sure, one day, you will get there, but until then let's try to focus on learning a little bit more, so all right i'll repeat myself just so you guys remember.
        - Excuse me, maam.
        - So we have the Lunar orbiter in there, which is specificity right Luis right Jazmin we were talking about specificity earlier great.
        - does that make sense?
        - Wonderful. I'm glad you're all here. Did you all read the assignment that I send out to you about finding water on the moon.
        - Yeah, yeah, I do.
        - i'm excuse me, I shut me in this group I already know all about space.
        - So we thank you, we appreciate you for that anybody else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us.
        - Try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well. There is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before. And you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us
        - I love that you guys Thank you so much, and if, when you come back next time, try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience.  deb Thank you so much for that response you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you all so much.
        - So we just read the water on the moon passage in class right?
        - Hey guys, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me. Yes. Luis
        - Oh well, let's let's talk about your answer because maybe if your answer so great, if we can probably help some of the others who are here 
        - Okay, so hearing your responses, I do want to do a little bit of work, you guys had some awesome answers, but I want to make them even better.
        - Alright guys, so we just answered the second question, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and so you guys had some great answers.
        - Low information check for understanding or vague instruction or statement (e.g., "Does that make sense?)
        - If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together. Does that make sense.
        - Well, that's awesome. Well, I just want to kind of talk to The small group just to have a little bit more extra time with you to go over a few things I'm looking at your responses.
        - I'm going to work with you in two different groups Farrah and Oliver. I'm going to start with you first.
        - Welcome to reading task water on the moon. Have you read it?
        - Okay, anybody else have any questions before we dive into our answers.
        - OK. I have to think about it, then.
        - You see it?
        - The Lunar...?
        - Okay, well, there are a couple of other students that I just want to ask a couple questions and maybe clarify and we can all talk about it, too, and go over the answers um so Farrah.
        - So I like a lot of these answers, but why don't we, I think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers. 
        - Yeah, yeah. That's what it says in the text.
        - So right now, if everyone has their texts in front of them. Can I get a thumbs up or a yes, if you have your text still in front of you?
        - Okay, so we're going to go through and i'm going to ask you guys a little bit more about what you said, for your answers so once again, the question is.
        - Okay. So should we just talk to each other or
        - And I loved your responses and I just want to know a little bit more about it because i'm looking at the text and i'm a little confused too 
        - Um, yeah. So I said that water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it on the ships anymore.
        - And that may be the case. Luis, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning 
        - Yeah okay yeah that sounds cool. 
        - Any other questions?
        - I know, but we're just talking about it, 
        -  And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today. So I really liked reading all of your answers. Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing. You guys found in the article.
        - Oh okay well if that's the case and that's perfect and like I, so I would have the same note for Farrah as well.
        - We're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon. 
        - See some head nods. Anyone want to share
        - As we're going over our answers, I wanted to think back and let's really look at the question to see what the question was asking.
        - That is precisely it you know what it's extra difficult when something is unfamiliar to us and.
        - Well you don't need to necessarily have background knowledge about space, so you read the article.
        - Yes, I see that you know a lot about space, but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon.
        - Good, awesome so we just read the passage that is called water is a valuable resource.
        - Okay, well, so my question is, is it Okay, if I just say the microscope or do I have to less like all of the equipment, like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things.
        - So we have a lot of different answers.
        - Oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two 
        - The answers to everyone's discussion question.
        - Right, I understand, but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses. It only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great. I'm sure you'll have some great contributions today. 
        - Teacher : Does that make sense. Luis
        - Hello class. Thank you for joining our group today I wanted to start off by reading the question to everybody and then thinking about what the most important part of the question is
        - I'd actually like if we stayed together as a group. I like the small group dynamic, would you mind staying with us and following along, 
        - Okay, so what we're, we will take a little bit more time and dig into that in a bit.
        - I don't understand why my, my answers wrong.
        - Does that make sense. Jazmin.
        - Yeah, we've all read it already.
        - um yeah okay.
        - let's get back to the tax, have you found the correct answer Chris.
        - Luis. Hang on one second. I know some of you were really interested in that and had the same question I did like how did the scientists so far away, find water.
        - Yeah, so I guess I was picturing like all this water but really it was just like, like a little, little ice deposits
        - A lunar orbiter. So what machine discovered water.
        - I didn't see you. Didn't I just want to make sure that we're on the same page.
        - yeah I I thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - that's cool, I guess, I can stick around.
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Hey everyone, I'm so I just heard your great responses. I just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding. We have a great start. But we, there's a couple pieces were missing. So can we work together to do that. Yeah.
        - Does that help clarify?
        - I said, you need a scientific microscope to look really closely.
        - do you understand what i'm saying.
        - Well, actually I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.
        - But there's some answers that maybe can be just
        - Okay I love talking about space.
        - Okay, well, we're just going to talk a little bit more
        - But I want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole group, and then I want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole group applies to your question does that sound good.
        - And that's why I pulled you
        - Hello, boys and girls I'm, what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy together, then you are going to practice it, and in a small group and I will come to talk to you a little more individually later if you still have some progress. Okay.
        - Yeah, can I try again.
        - Oh, that's pretty nice. Luis right now we're answering the question. Okay, so once we answer the question and finish what we're doing here. Maybe they'll have extra time to talk about stuff that relates to a question. Okay.
        - Do you understand why I had you do this.
        - hi everyone thanks for joining me here today, so we just read a short passage about water on the moon, and I got to read all of your responses and I just wanted to see if we could.
        - Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that.
        - I gotta say if if I think it's a valuable or not, I think.
        - yeah so that's kind of like they use First they use the Lunar orbiter and then I use a microscope.
        - Okay, so who can tell me what the article is about.
        - Oh ok ok ok that makes sense.
        - So right if you know things about space, but there's always more that we can learn. It's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this group because we can have a better understanding.
        - Some responses on your questions and I wanted to work with you guys, to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes Luis.
        - How it's used to find water.
        - Ok so I found a small machine.
        - Can you say it again.
        - hi Farrah high Oliver hi Chris hi Jazmin hi Luis So do you guys want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question.
        - Okay, I can do that. Yeah.
        - Okay, so I'm happy that y'all are all here today and I was looking over your responses
        -  does that make sense
        - Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was. And your responses. 
        - amen so look at your response and then think about like does your the response that you wrote answer both of those two things.
        - Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed
        - Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means.
        - Hi guys. Did you enjoy reading
        - Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
        - does everyone understand that.
        - And so the water that they found is microscopic. Do we know what the word microscopic means?
        - Yes, we did.
        - As I was saying you guys all started off great and we're headed in the right direction and we only need to build your response, a little more to fully answer the question so to start with Farrah.
        - um well I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - You know, I think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge, but nobody can know everything about one thing. So the more we learn the better off we might be. So maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on. And maybe we can learn from it. Okay.
        - And I love to hear from two other scholars and you, you can also comment on it, and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um.
        - I'm, I'm, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch. I know it was really really short. And we just met, but I really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer, right everybody?
        - And together we're going to come up with a really good answer that uses all of your really great answers. We're going to come together. We're going to make a much better one.
        - connecting the information in your brain is also going to help you a lot, but I just want to make sure that you're getting the best answer. You can, is that okay
        - Yeah, so I just have to add the name of it. And then my answers fine?
        - Well okay so yeah cuz I I I kind of had the same thinking. I said, Man, I was like, okay, a scientific tool is equipment on the water. Okay. But yeah, I see what you're saying about looking. It's not the same as discovering okay
        - Hi boys and girls. So we just finished our small discussion about water on the moon. And you guys all had wonderful responses.
        - When you know you can raise your hand and I will call on you.
        - Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different.
        - Alright, everyone so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses, because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know, the more everyone seems to have a different response yeah Luis have a question.
        - Everybody. Jazmin, do you know what microscopic mean? No?
        - Does my suggestion makes sense would that have helped you
        - can you do that for me Luis.
        - Um, I guess, like what I was wondering, like, Um, okay, so like a small machine. Well, okay, so I think that I'm beginning to understand, but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and I got the same answer as Farrah
        - Oh well, cuz you told me that at the name of it, so I just added the name of it, I didn't add anymore after that.
        - Our high quality answer can be found in the text. Yes, Jazmin well
        - And everyone has really good parts of answers and some parts that we can work on, so I want to give you a strategy that I think would be really helpful for us to like make our responses more concise and find out what we're looking for.
        - And so your responses were all a bit little bit different. So I love that because we have a variation of answers. But I just wanted to go over these responses to see if we can get some really great answers.
        - So let's think a little bit deeper about that. And that's a good response so
        - To really comprehend what's going on there, 
        - Yeah, yeah, I think I got it.
        - So I think if we chat together and put some of these pieces together we're all going to end up with really improved answers, so I think for this first question.
        - equipment is the answer to the question does that sound good.
        - And after you have shared your answer with me, I am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right, and I want you to think about their thinking, as well as you're thinking yes Luis.
        - So all five of us. We all have I heard some really great answers. Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole group response. 
        - OK?
        - I don't.
        - Like in an English class.
        - So just basically look closer and it stated in the text, but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start.
        - Um, yeah, he he read the whole sentence. And so it said the name of the machine.
        - um yeah this is Luis I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Okay, thank you. Farrah for your question. Any other questions.
        - All right, we're all done yeah alright perfect now i'm going to go through each of you, so that we can try and build your responses, a little better okay.
        - That's good, that's good. So we all, we all just read water on the moon. And you guys answered in your journal some questions. 
        - So let's work on formulate this sentence together. So we got the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Great, are there any other questions.
        - Try to think about why we have to use.
        - Alright, did everyone have enough time?
        - So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to
        - Oh, so it has to be from the story.
        - Do you see how we could use that information.
        - And even if you circle the last sentence, I still want you to say something. It's for good participation and I want to make sure everybody says their answer.
        - um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.
        - All right, we're going to learn some more stuff. Okay, so you hang with us and we'll learn all kinds of new things.
        - Right. Do you want to go through it together. So let's see what we can come up with together.
        - Do you have a question.
        - You need a        - oh the miscroscope. Yeah, the microscope.
        - Right. Well, we've all been separated into a different group. That way, we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions.
        - Does that make sense,Luis?
        - Yeah, I want you guys to just look at the question
        - Does that make sense 
        - In my room. I have a favorite word. It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we
        - Okay yeah sure.
        - All right. Awesome. Okay, you can put your hands down. Here's my first job for you.
        - I want to go over a couple of things. So did we just read an article
        - Ah um yeah I can see that.
        - Let me know if you have any questions.
        - Everyone agree.
        - Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Luis are you looking at, paragraph two, there
        - Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever.
        - Okay, so great job explaining um that you guys think or did not think that water could be valuable on the moon for astronauts but I guess Luis okay.
        - Okay, so.
        - Does hat makes sense, so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there.
        - Yeah, I didn't really read it the first time. So yeah, I think that I see. I think I understand, like, why that's that might be a better answer.
        - That's wonderful. We all corrected our answers and be revised it and I just want to make sure that
        - Luis can I pause you for one second. we're going to hear what Farrahs was thinking and then we're all going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay.
        - yeah, I can do that.
        - are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it.
        - um Luis  I saw you guys seen this group, because I think that all your answers showed really good understanding of space, but I think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions.
        - That's good. This group wasn't formed because you don't know about space. It's just sometimes we can learn more when we work together.
        - Okay, so yeah.  I'm going to be your teacher today. OK, so the you read the water on the moon text already, raise your hand if you read it.
        - Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right
        - i'll give you guys all a second. hang on Chris i'm going to give you guys all second to go back and revise then I want to hear from Farrah and to else haven't I heard from yet, I think.
        - Great. I love space to I want us to put on our science minds and only think about the article that we read. So in the article that we read a read it out loud for us.
        - Okay, all right, paragraph two, it says lunar orbit our land at the south Pole and.
        - But from this point on, I think I'm going to need to finish with telling you guys what's going on. And then you can raise your hands. After, okay.
        - Does that make sense you three
        - because I was wondering if we could raise our hand if we said that no the water was not valuable.
        - Oh yeah, I see it.
        - Oh well, you know that's the great part about being in a group, we all have different strengths, we bring to it, so you may know a lot about space, but you know I think there's always something you can learn
        - yeah great question and Oliver, I really want you to pay close attention to what's Farrah and I are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as Farrah okay.
        - Okay, so, reflecting in our answer.
        - So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. And I saw your previous journal entry. And I want to start. 
        - that's awesome that you know a lot about space, but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space I don't think, have you been.
        - Great Okay, so you guys just read a very short article. Yes Luis. 
        - So, um, you all gave responses. And I just want to like we want to meet in a group, just so we can work on our responses. Does that make sense. Alright, so
        - Oh yeah, I believe it, but there's always more to learn. No matter what the subject and even if you know all about space right now. 
        - we just need to take it a little bit further, 
        - When I got all your answers back to the prompt, there was a couple of things I wanted to go back over just to make sure that we're all on the same page.
        - Quick does everyone know what a crater is.
        -  So after, I have to write more stuff.
        - What do you guys have questions about so
        - That is a way better answer. Do you see why it's a better answer.
        - Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading. That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text. So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for.
        - The question. Let me ask you again, actually, who did you guys enjoy this. The short text, did you guys learn anything. How'd you like it.
        - Oh yeah I circled the same thing that Farrah did you.
        - Okay. Well, I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So can I add something too about equipment?
        - Thank you. All right. Who's ready to move on to the third paragraph.
        - Luis You said you know a lot about space, you want to share anything else.
        - I would just want some more expanding of your answers like anyone can expand on their answers, but if you don't have anything to say that's totally fine.
        - i'm now, I think I was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on YouTube.
        - Are you able to add to your Answer.
        - Okay, and you did read the text, right, which was water is a valuable resource.
        - Yeah, I still don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Okay, this one isn't a question, but now i'm just all thinking about my answer.
        - No, not yet, but I will.
        - So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go I really wanted to thank you for a couple things.
        - Oh yeah, I think that makes a lot more sense. Thank you.
        - Does everyone understand that. Can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense.
        - So this was an activity where I kind of wanted you guys to discuss the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - yeah yeah that does.
        - That it's really our learning is really set in stone. Okay, so, um,
        - but for a lot of us and spaces just totally for, and I mean let's be honest, none of us have been there before right.
        - I think the last one. So you were looking at Luis's answer right.
        - Well it's time for us to go to lunch, but I do want to say, I appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers.
        - Luis have I heard from you?
        - I'm thinking about. Okay, so what you're saying is that they sent the Lunar Orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to
        - Okay, I guess, I can stick our out.
        - There's always room to learn more, even if we think we're the best at a subject. There's always something new we need to learn.
        - After that we are going to give each of you some time, maybe two or three minutes to revise your response, and then we will share with our small group does that sound like a good plan.
        - Teacher : That's okay, Luis. We're gonna talk more about space today. My name is Miss Teacher and I'm going to be working with you.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group teacher. I know a lot about space.
        - Does everyone understand these instructions.
        - So does anyone have questions or want to disagree with that statement? Oliver, you have a hand up what are you thinking?
        - And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing. You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like Oliver and I'm sure to the rest of you.
        - Well, we might can look just a little bit closer. And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future.
        - Give more information to
- intent: r210.1
  examples: |
        - So we might disagree with each other. Some of us for all going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions. That's okay if you disagree with each other.
        - Right. So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it. So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment.
        - So, people might have different opinions, but all opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text.
        - Well, but to get to get out of the Earth's atmosphere. Okay, takes a lot of force. Right.
        - No, no, that that was the the Lunar Orbiter.
        -  Um NASA
        - Water on the moon be valuable.
        - So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?
        - Yeah, I see what you're saying.
        - Right. They use different equipment. Right? But remember, you're looking at the the passage. Right? But a question actually relates to the passage. So what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage. Right, Chris?
        - Okay, they do use that in space. But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water. So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water?
        - And that is absolutely true scientists do use all those kinds of equipment. Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well.
        - So, in the first paragraph you're talking about how there was there, there was water on the moon, and now they think that there is water.
        - Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how
        - Oh, oh okay yeah.
        - And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things. Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have. For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it. 
        - Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water. I was like, Well, I thought about this all night. 
        - on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how.
        - Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter.
        - Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right
        - Well, this is just a guess, but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it, but not all of it.
        - Um, equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon
        - Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced? you can answer that Chris as well.
        - Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?
        - Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space.
        - Provides explanation of the question without a reference to the text (e.g., build background knowledge)
        - Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon. they're they're there for a little while.
        - and think about maybe going to a family member's house. there's a certain way that you get there.
        - An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water. 
        - that's that is precisely it. so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon. we're leaving that up to NASA 
        - Right now on the moon. We've seen water before but they people haven't seen water on the moon yet. 
        - So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable. This is a a question that asked for your opinion.
        - And we didn't see the Lunar Orbiter. But we did see something also be sent up to the moon. I don't remember exactly the name of it, um,
        - And that's how they discovered the war. that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong. you guys had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers.
        - What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter. But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope. So your answer actually would be correct.
        - I can't really can't carry
        - Um yeah i'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock out, we have to go to lunch right now.
        - Well, there can be multiple and there are multiple answers for a question. Can't there. 
        - yeah perfect. that's great. so the scientists are working with NASA 
        -  To address Chris question, I would just like to clarify. So when we talk about NASA here were first of all two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here. So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground.
        - But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?
        - That's absolutely right. Find, is a perfect word. So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time. 
        - Yeah, that that was a very good answer. And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen. You've probably heard water all through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen. And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things.
        - yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks 
        - Yeah, they used to go home. That's right. Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful. They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the
        - The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that all the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for. 
        - I'm not clear on. So which one is the right answer is usable microscope.
        - Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this.
        - Yeah yeah yeah yeah
        - Right, yeah.
        - Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
        - Okay, so I put all of us into this group because everyone here has a partial answer. Does anyone know what a partial answer means?
        - Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house. You guys have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them. You could just say a rug.
        - Oh, I didn't really read that closely because I thought I kind of knew this stuff.
        - Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time. Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy
        - So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water Farrah and you find something yeah okay.
        - But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans.
        - Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate. Okay.
        - So if your rocket doesn't weigh as much and it'll probably be a little easier for the rocket to get into outer space. Correct.
        - Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it.
        - Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen. And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe. So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen. 
        - Okay, do you want to share your answer with us.
        - I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have all these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph.
        - I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but.
        - But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live
- intent: r210.2
  examples: |
        - All right, I'm convincing is good. And there's one more word that we use a lot in science.
        - Yeah, so when we think of value most of the time, we think of money. So valuable can also be something that we need.
        - See if you can look the shark.
        - um yeah okay. so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something.
        -  because the question's asking what what equipment the scientists used and I want you guys to find that in your response. okay so go ahead and circle that.
        - Provides explanation of the question with a reference to the text (e.g., vocabulary, key word, type of question)
        - Right so discover is our most important word in that question. And so when we look at our text, we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water.
        - But what equipment did they use to find it?
        - And so, based on this What could we guess? what do we think? what piece of information is this question asking us to find?
        - So something that can be helpful. Helpful is another word instead of using valuable. It's something that's helpful to us.
        - Okay, so how about I build off that again? So what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using?
        - what was the question actually asking us to determine about this NASA mission?
        - How about the word evidence and the word value?
        - Does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words?
        - What piece of equipment Did the scientists use to find water on the moon? What was that small machine called?
        - Yeah, so when you discover something, It's the first time you see something so you're really not being able to Really dive in and examine and look at it. And so when we go to discover something, it's, it's the first time we've seen it.
        - With the word equipment, because that's what we're looking for right? we want to make sure we include a piece of equipment.
        - We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water. 
        - Equipment is like something you use so could be like a tool or something.
        - The first. So I guess if we rewrite the question, what we would say?
        - We're talking about water on the moon. And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank. 
        - What equipment Did the scientists use to discover the water? not where is the water found. 
        - Okay, now with this question. It's a new question. So is there convincing evidence That water on the moon could be valuable? Now there are some key words in this question. 
        - The moon. so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there.
        - So let's look it. specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped.
        - So what I would like to do is take a minute to think about the WHO and the what and the how .so who do we need to focus on?
        - If, if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it, and they like the try to get you to do with a big, that's convincing.
        - So is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit, so it can be easier to understand, because there are some big words in there, like evidence and valuable. So is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us?
        - So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text. So what does discover mean?
        - Right. It's like finding something. so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things. So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water?
        - Okay, good. so if there's a question about maybe where or what is it asking us really?
        - How can water be valuable? So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable. So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense. Okay.
        - So we are going to use the same strategy, the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question. Okay. Keywords something important to help us find it back in the text.
        - Yeah, like whatever you think that was equipment to discover water.
        - It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used.
        - but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it.
        - Okay um well just by going over the word equipment, I wanted to make sure that everybody knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not everybody understands the question and then sometimes.
        - do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking?
        - Thank you, so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how Jazmin's.
        - There are key words.
        - Okay, for the first time right and is it always obvious like Oh, I know exactly where that is.
        - Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon. So to answer your question, Farrah and deaf so far.
        - But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found.
        - Alright, so what is it really asking for? what information does it want to know?
        - And if you were an artist, maybe some equipment, you would use would be a marker. So equipment is a tool that you use to do your job, and if you were a scientist, you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right?
        - It's expensive. Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable. Good. Okay. 
        - Well, I think that the question was asking was sort of asking that if you knew that NASA used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking, would you say that's good equipment is.
        -  um I guess it's not really in the story.
        - Oh, excuse me?
        - So, not to look at water but to discover water on the moon.
        - But when we're looking at our question. We will. This one is asking for us to see in the text, what tools were used. So, although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text. What exactly did NASA use?
        - I was gonna say the same stuff. 
        - You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool. So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym. So they're synonyms of each other.
        - Right good so using those keywords like using building alright, so we got two parts of their so Luis said.
        - kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon, and then you named it, I think that might be that might be.
        -  Oh.
        - Okay it's asking what equipment.
        - So, for example, in the text we can say that some of the.
        - So what equipment. Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon.
        - that's true what kind of equipment, or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for. Are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use?
        - Um, yeah. So I felt like that's what I did. I took off the oxygen tanks. And so I said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one. But you said that's not I wasn't
        - So when we're answering this, we want to name the equipment and we want to make sure that it's used to find the water 
        - yeah that's a really good point, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like, in particular, I really wanted to
        - I would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope. You wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope.
        - Well, it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because I don't know why my answer is wrong.
        - In a way, yes. But this is also why science questions are a little tricky. If you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or Oliverice specifically used for that purpose.
        - So they used. Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?
        - Right. I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water.
        - I guess like I'm when I discover on I was thinking more. It's like when you find something, I guess.
        - Alright Chris Jazmin Luis and why do you like to share the word that you guys chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share.
        - An instrument.
        - So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?
        - So we're discovering water on the moon. 
        - Yeah I okay so I went to NASA with like that. And when we were there. We saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that. So I was wondering, like, is that part of you know what I mean is that part of how they found the found the water?
        - Yeah, it's still valuable, though, you're right, value can mean money to that value has a double meaning, but in this sense, the valuable in the question means
        - great and so if we think about what we read in the text and we try to consider this word equipment that might give us a little clue for what we're looking for and so.
        - do you think you can rephrase that question and put it in your own words.
        - So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water.
        - What equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them. Yeah.
        - Excellent. So what key word from our question. Have we already found from this heading.
        - That okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay.
        - Oh yeah okay okay so First they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope.
        - Oh that's okay.
        - Next, Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but how what equipment did they use or in the text. What equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon? Do you know?
        - We decided that we were looking for equipment that is used to discover water on the moon.
        - To investigate. Let me look for that water in the story
        - Okay, so we all did. I think that's what it's mainly asking. So we know that scientists discovered water on the moon. So we know that part already
        - So what is the meaning of valuable there?
        - yeah I was thinking water.
        - What is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place, what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death.
        - In this context, it looks like the specific question you guys identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so.
        - Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space. But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space. So in the question asks us
        - But that's not what we're looking for. Right now we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon.
        - um yeah okay um I can go back and look. 
        - yeah exactly so I brought a few examples, so if you were a baker some equipment that you might use would be a whisk.
        - So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon.
        -  Like important. 
        - Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use.
        - So if, if you don't have to carry the water, then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry.
        - Okay, and good. I like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two key words to help us answer this question, Chris and Jazmin. What words did you guys underline
        - So when we look back at our text. We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Right so maybe there's not a lot of water. And now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water?
        - I think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools, help them discover more water on earth, excuse me, not on earth.
        - All of these answers are correct, but I want to look at the word equipment and the second one, I noticed no one circled was discover. Does anyone know why discover would be an important word in the question?
        - So basically nothing stops and it's not like I shouldn't do that. It's the Lunar Orbiter. That's the small
        - Um, I know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon. And I'm like, it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is
        - So um first let's go over it, so the question can anyone tell me what off the bat the question is asking? yes Luis.
        - So, so we needed to find the equipment. But the key was what equipment. Did they used to discover. Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things.
        - But Oliver Do you remember what our key action word in our question was.
        - I thought I thought water was an important one, too.
        - Is it talking about how they water or is it talking about
        - So I was just thinking, like, I think I got this all figured out, so I think good to go.
        - We're looking to see if the if the like. Okay, so is there like good proof I guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and I think it is and I think you could even grow a garden on the moon.
        - What equipment.
        - Let. Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms. Who remembers what term.
        - You say equipment. So what is another word this question, Chris.
        - So when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future 
        - Because it's an action word, because the scientists are discovering water, but how does-sorry discovering it. That's the action word. Excuse me, sorry I was confusing.
        - Oh, yes. Water is important. Mm hmm. Yes, because the question does ask about water. 
        - so let's think about how does this answer the question about is it valuable, is it helpful right um.
        - Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of
        - Evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something. So it's like proof.
        - That is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment, which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down.
        - Anything keep the craters We just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay.
        - Gotcha. Oh, OK. So they did, like, Okay, that makes sense. So it's really like what was in there reading
        - Right so who knows, just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about.
        - Yeah, no, no, no, no. You're right. Yeah, oxygen tanks, we don't we don't discover water with the tanks, we just, we don't need them to breathe on the moon.
        - You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment. So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object. 
        - And I want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water, so do we think that, looking at water and discovering water are the same, are they different.
        -  so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what is one important word and that question Jazmin.
        - Right, what specific equipment. Did they use to discover water on the moon.
        - So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon. 
        - It's a tool right
        - Um, yeah. So equipment is like something that you you like use to accomplish a task like it's something like a machine or like a tool that you use to do something.
        - Hmm, OK. OK, I'll
        - So we actually had a kind of a decision about
        - Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading.
        - You're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the, for the first time.
        - So the key was what equipment. Did they use to discover. So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it.
        - So Chris brought up a great point what equipment means. So these are tools, people can use.
        - Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking. They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right
        - When I first discover something. What are we doing Jazmin.
        - I just, I was just wondering, Well my answer was wrong.
        - so also build enough that remember the tool that we're looking for specifically it's supposed to find the water, you know it's supposed to help us collect the water search for the water, and so you guys mentioned the cups.
        - Okay, let's talk about evidence. 
        - Correct. Those are all types of equipment. And so what about the word discover. Do we all know what the word discover means
        - Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - So breaking down the question does everybody know what the word equipment means.
        - and I mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there, maybe one other yes Farrah.
        - Hey, okay. Okay, so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover on the microscope to observe
        - And as we said the word discover means to find so yes truth. 
        - They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned.
        - Okay. So I said, the main point was water.
        - Okay, that's the question. And so. Does everyone here know what the word equipment means
        - but we said when we circled in the second key word.
        - I'm glad we're able to see that. But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering. Right. Can you remind me what the question says,
        - yeah I agree, so I think that that's exactly what the question is asking it says what equipment, did they use 
        - So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon. What did they use to find that
        - What did they use to find the water. The what the designed to send to the moon to find the water do you can you find that in the text.
        - But spending the money, building the equipment, and doing the research, do you think that it would be worth it? Is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for NASA to spend the money and do the research?
        - I think discover is like
        - What are our key words in the question, what are we looking for?
        - Okay so Luis, then, can you explain to me what the question is asking?
        - Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable.
        - Where do you think we can find our answer Jazmin?
        -  But, as you and Farrah also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is.
        - um yeah I think Jazmin said it, and it was discover.
        - Okay yeah no problem, so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water.
        - Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean.
        - So our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon, which is how they found it at first, right?
        - Well, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits.
        - Jazmin I really like how you found the word machine in the text because I find that that word machine is kind of similar to the word equipment.
        - Yeah. That's science, so yeah. 
        - And the water, of course, that is the object that they were, that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know.
        - So specifically, what do they use not their suits. But what they use to find the water. Does that make a little bit more sense.
        - Oh so, I have to say the machine.
        - The way they found the water because the water is very small. It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water. The key word is
        - but once again thinking back to the question itself, what do we want the specific equipment to do.
        - Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules. But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it
        - um equipment.
        - Alright so what I'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth  Investing in.
        - They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment. I'm sorry.
        - I would say that's equipment, because we were talking about equipment, but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon, and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm.
        - And the question. It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment.
        - um it wants us to say.
        - Well, they used. Right. So the question was what equipment did scientists use
        - Perfect that is exactly right and equipment can be some kind of  scientific tools 
        - Is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it.
        - Right, something that you can use. Okay, that's great.
        - yeah sorry about that, let me remind you, so what is another word that means the same thing as discover.
        - Okay, to discover right discover. When I discover something right did I know where it was before that.
        - And so, some would say yes, and some people would be no 
        - Right, the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water, the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water
        - Jazmin and Luis What did you pull out as being the most important part of the question.
        - So discover water. So we're looking for a piece of equipment to discover water.
        - Okay, good job. So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon. 
        - we're looking for specific equipment that will help us find one on the water right and Jazmin and Chris, I also noticed that you guys did that to.
        -  so to be valuable is similar to what Oliver said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways
        - Um, but the question is asking you to find the equipment to discover the water. Not for the oxygen, right?
        - Yes. And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment.
        - You think yes or no.
        - I can.
        - It means like when you find something
        - In the actual passage. It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons. You know why its valuable. So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable. 
        - So potential. That means it may it that is going to be valuable. Right. It has the potential to be valuable.
        - yeah so as far as we know, in the reading the tools that we have our microscopes and lunar orbiters and the question we're answering is which tool to the scientists use to discover the water on the moon.
        - You're right. But if we look back at our question. It's telling us to talk about what equipment. So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters. But what tool where they using?
        - So it can be taken in multiple different directions, some people could be very like how you guys each said, one thing, but if we bring it all together, we have all the equipment, we need to find the water on the moon
        - Yeah. So remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile.
        - Oh, I figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon.
        - About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it. But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand
        - Yeah, this is going to be a lot of fun. So I first want to go over the question, the question that was asked was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Can somebody tell me what this question is looking for
        - equipment equipment and discover yeah.
        - Right to discover is to look for.
        - that's I, and this is the thing about the question that we're going to get into, which is what is the wrong or right answer in this question because the question just kind of asked us about equipment right?
        -  Okay, so now we have all of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it.
        - Okay. Oh yeah, because we will use equipment in PE class.
        - The scientists find water on the moon. 
        - So is there convincing evidence. So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article. What it says directly. Okay. That water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - Okay well equipment is the key word. But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment. In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon. Okay, does that make sense.
        - My question for you is, what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space.
        - Hey everyone. So you gave really great responses to this question. I want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment.
        - And they also talk about craters. In the story, which Chris brought up so that everybody had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found. How to find water on the moon, don't we, yes Oliver.
        - Right. But what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon, 
        - Oh that's interesting um do you think you understand the word investigate.
        - investigate can be somewhat equivalent to discovery right.
        - Now, what kind of value, why would that be valuable 
        - That's exactly right. So the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon. It's asking from the passionate itself.
        - Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable. OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important. Okay.
        - Okay and machines and tools that do what?
        - But the question right is about the purpose there's a specific kind of equipment right that the equipment, what are the equipment, help them do. 
        - Equipment as well. Okay, so the two words that I think are the most important that I heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover.
        - I want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment, so what might be a synonym.
        - And although it was microscopic. Um, let's see what NASA sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you guys think are really important Chris, would you like to add something.
        - Sure, well let's let's think about it. So the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So what does it mean to discover something?
        - Okay, so you have the equipment part, you know, that part is important, what action which which equipment. What equipment and scientists used to do what, what is the purpose of this equipment Oliver or Farrah, can you go
        - We have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment. 
        - Was covered water.
        - Or what was used for to discover what?
        - Okay, so we're. The question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon. So you're right. We're looking for equipment. But what did the equipment do
        - Okay, so let's look at our question. Again, we have what equipment we used. We already know about the different types of equipment what keyword
        - And it seems like there's almost two parts to this question right what tool was used and how was it used What did it do.
        - Discover, yes, great this the word in the question and this is the action that we are looking for in the passage.
        - They need oxygen. But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon.
        - So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right 
        - Equipment. Okay. So we are looking specifically for equipment.
        -  that were discovered was the key word we were looking at
        - But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you guys to find was evidence and valuable yes def
        - We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist. 
        - That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water
        - Okay. So I agree. They used to look at water is it what they find the water with
        -  So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that. But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So our key word here is equipment.
        - So they're trying to discover the water, does everyone agree? So now I want everyone to look at the reading. Yes, Luis.
        - They're looking for quick the equipment. Right. 
        - The scientists use the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Um, okay, the equipment they use to discover the water?
        - Oh, like a pencil.
        - Yeah, it's kind of like a tool. So they're asking what tool. Scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - It's not the question is not asking necessarily about
        - Yes, discover. So when you discover something you're looking for it. 
        - The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water.
        - Well, to me, when I think of the word valuable, I would say that I think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question, the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Okay, so what is another what is another main word of this question.
        - So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right. 
        - The equipment is used to discover water right? 
        - Good. Now look at the word discover talk to yourself again about the word discover
        - but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology. Did they need to discover that water. So you're going to be looking for our
        - To help us answer this question.
        - Because the question. I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water
        - Um, okay. So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value.
        - But do we know how they discovered and found the water is there a place in the reading where we know what Oliverice they used to find it.
        - Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it.
        - But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Gotcha. Yeah, so that's a really good question. Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like Farrah says the equipment that's used to discover the water.
        - The to look at the water. What did they use to find the water
        - I'm discovering like when you find them, but like, it's when you find them for the first time.
        - Is it a good resource that water on the moon. Is it a good resource and why. And if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable.
        - but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them.
        - I feel like the way the question was phrased. They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um
        - I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I got that I'm in the third paragraph.
        - Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof.
        - So the word evidence, what is it what is evidence, can you tell me what evidence is?
        - The question uses the word discover which is the same as find
        - We're not asking how they got there, we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well, what equipment didt the scientists use?
        - Okay. And that is a great answer. But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important. Can anyone help me explain what the word discover means?
        - In the question. There's a term. And the question that we're looking for.
        - Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence. It's just asking.
        - What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things.
        - So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment. Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon.
        - But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find all that water because it. What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?
        - The important words in the question, are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read, so you want to look in the question and see.
        - Sure, it was easy to find so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's what's the important word of that sentence, do you think.
        - So Luis, do you want to try answering that question for us, what does equipment mean.
        - we have to look in this story.
        -  But right now we're looking to see how they found the water. What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon. So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks.
        - Like to find it for the first time.
        - Wery good job. So when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment. 
        - Yes, exactly so discover means to find.
        - It'll be a verb.
        - Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon.
        - Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Do you have any really important words in that question.
        - What does it mean, what does it
        - So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage
        -  it needs to be a thing.
        - What do you think that means
        - Right. So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-        - if it was there to see it?
        - What's the word in that question that gives you a hint at where to look in the passage
        - Oh yeah I got it. It's discover
        - They said something about investigating what did they used to investigate.
        - So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist.
        - but what are we looking for for this specific question?
        - yeah okay sure, and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Uh huh, uh huh.
        - Right. Okay. And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does anybody can answer.
        - So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct
        - Ah. OK, gotcha. Yeah.
        - Mm hmm. Um, maybe they use like I'm a shovel to dig it up.
        - yeah um, so I think that's why I picked the answer from paragraph two, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Well that's Okay, now we know that the question, the key word was the equipment, 
        - But the question is,
        - Asking, What are those important words. Go ahead.
        - Great so what what is the question asking for, are they asking for um what was found on the moon, or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon, what do you think.
        - Now this is a tricky question. Okay. Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word.
        - What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon, not which equipment was more important.
        - But maybe, we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that, OK, you know what this says, we need to focus on the tools, we're going to focus on the tools.
        - color and sweatshirt. The other words and the question don't really have much meaning.
        - You're right. Does anyone have any ideas of how we can share evidence? Sometimes we can use a quote. Does anyone know what that means?
        - Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I do remember that. We learned that if somebody says something, then you can say what they said, I think. OK, I don't know.
        - It. There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them. 
        - Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong, cuz I did pull from that I said a small machine. And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know?
        - A machine.
        - Good job. I like that you circled the word equipment, just like Farrah because that'll help find the answer in the passage will have to look for the word equipment and see if you can find the correct answer. 
        - Good. Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover, 
        - Okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh I just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch, right now, but I just wanted to say thank you so much.
        - And this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine. 
        - Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon.
        - Great. So we're looking for the equipment used. 
        - So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?
        - Yeah, right. But the question is asked her as to find what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water not observing the water
        - And what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope?
        - Well, there you at the end of the paragraph, it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable 
        - um Okay, we are it's asking us about equipment that used to discover water on the moon.
        - I want you to so i'm a little concerned that the question you need to answer is asking about the equipment, okay, so we really want to make sure that we can find that equipment in the text um 
        - Well, okay. So I went to nasa with my dad and when we went there I saw that scientists, a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like I i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what I mean, that's the tools that they're using
        - circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question, so we need to make sure that we identify a specific piece of equipment that scientists used, and then the equipment is used to discover water on the moon.
        - All right, and what's, the key word that they're asking for.
        - let's go back to the question, which is what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon. Circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question right? so what part of those instructions kind of help you remember, oh I got to use the text or useful knowledge?
        - Okay, so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it, 
        - what that question is.
        - because that's what the question is asking for it's asking for a piece of equipment Chris, did you have a question.
        - Okay, what equipment. Did they use to discover the water that's what Farrah is saying. 
        - Oh. Oh, OK. OK, so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story. 
        - But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So again, where are we going to look for the answer. Are we going to look around the classroom. Are we going to look to our friend.
        - Oh. Discover
        - Right. So what we're looking for, then, is a tool that was actually used to find the water right? 
        - Like those oxygen tanks, so that they breathe and like, there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death, you know,
        - mm hmm So what is the question looking for and it's answer.
        - So while we're working together. I want you to to you all to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced.
        - Yeah, great sometimes we look at the question. And if we look at an action. The word, but the question is talking about that is also an important a word. So did anybody circle the words in a question that was important to establish equipment.
        - Within within the actual text. What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon.
        - What does convincing mean
        - But I was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax.
        - Good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not 
        - But before we even look at the article again and start our discussion, what do you think are the I don't know, maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking.
        - yeah and so let's take a look at the question again, what is the question asking us to find.
        - Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer. from that source. 
        - In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word. It's something that they did 
        - But that doesn't help them find the water. What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter. They did need the microscope as Farrah, and Oliver mentioned.
        - Does anyone know why discover would also be an important word in the question?
        - So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing. So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?
        - Absolutely, you are on the right track. So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about. Does anybody take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment... Well, first of all, can anybody tell me what equipment means. Can anybody give me another word for equipment?
        -  now, they did find water on the moon, but what equipment, did they use to find that water.
        - But, did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why Jazmin circle, the Lunar orbiter the small machine
        - Great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely.
        - I thought it was something that would find some water. But I feel like that's not it now. 
        -  But the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water 
        - yeah Jazmin, what do you know about the word equipment?
        - I want to focus on the word valuable specifically.
        - So that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe. So what equipment do they used to help them discover water.
        - So yes, you're right. But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water. So all those equipments. Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them. But we was looking for the tool for water.
        - When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that.
        - So i'm going to reread the question and once I finish, I want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer. So the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay Jazmin I noticed that yeah so first of all, you on finding up the keyword discover is really great 
        - Evidence as one. It's like something that you can pro. You know, it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it.
        - So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking.
        - So let's just say for this question. It says, What equipment do we know what equipment means
        - So we definitely use the microscope to look at the water, but the question asked which equipment, we use to find the water first 
        - So if we are trying to answer the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. The discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on. So was the tool that they use to discover the microscope, or was it maybe the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Jazmin. You also said that discover and investigate were really similar. So maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water.
        - The water on the moon. So when I think of that word discover. And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something. What am I doing
        - What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon. That would be your question. So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it.
        - Good. Does anybody know a synonym for the word investigate
        - Excuse me Ms. Teache while she's thinking I'm excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - We still see that as valuable, so I think that, just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right.
        - that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using
        - But in the question. It says what equipment. Did they use not. Where did they find it so
        - Great. So those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment. It's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word
        - tools is another way that we can help us find the word and then Jazmin said that we're also going to look for clues like digging and building, so that we know that we're using the equipment right anybody else anything else.
        - Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of. Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for. 
        - Yes, exactly because equipment, again, that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find.
        - I agree with you. Those are all very important words Chris. What do you think buddy.
        - equipment is like a tool, or like something you use to do something.
        - Right. So when the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So microscope isn't isn't a piece of equipment, but the word in the sentence that we need to look at is discover.
        - It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense.
        - This question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable.
        - You might have all that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water.
        - equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text, but just in general astronauts use helmets. Yes, Jazmin? 
        - Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question. That means the same thing.
        - Oh, I didn't even realize I said that.
        - Now, we need to figure out how they find it. I mean what equipment or Oliverice they are using to discover the water
        -  But the question was, um, what what equipment was used, so that they could find the water to begin with. So it's a different source of equipment.
        - Equipment discover and water. Good job. So you guys picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover
        - now if you go back to the question, the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water.
        - So we need to find the equipment that they used
        - And so, if we're thinking about equipment, what piece of equipment is used, based on the answer that you gave?
        - So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist. He is to discover water on the moon. So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon.
        - yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the Jazmin said the Lunar orbiter that's what found the right, and then they looked at the water, maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the.
        - So what what do we think the question is asking.
        - So right there. We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water. Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you guys about
        - All right, i'm seeing some nods, so I think we're really onto something here, and I agree, I think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can Somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for.
        - But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value. So this is an argument piece. So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable. 
        - So they they said right in the question convincing evidence that means we're going to use right
        - Right. Yeah, so that was more like Jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine.
        - What is the verb of this question.
        - And looking for and discovering
        - Right so in the question, it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing all of this.
        - What makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what, but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt.
        - So we're talking about convincing evidence. Evidence means information that supports the statement being made. So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports.
        - But I have a question for you so we're talking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Does anyone know what the word equipment is? or do we want to talk about that a little bit more?
        - Exactly right. So the question I asked you, what did they used to look at it, or what do they use to find it?
        - Good job. I like that you Circle the word equipment that will really help you find in the passage, what the answer.
        - In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment.
        - Oh um find.
        - Oh, so the part the circle part because I guess I don't have anything to circle when I talk about the oxygen tanks.
        - that's all right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when I say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources, something that we can use, so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water, the water that's on the moon.
        - huh what can someone tell me what what is equipment, I was saying it's my mouse and keyboard and we were talking about our supplies, but what what is equipment to you.
        - So what what might they have used to first discover. I remember Jazmin said when we discover something I'm finding it. I'm looking for it. I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it. So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water Jazmin.
        - Yes, I believe equipment discover water. Those are all three key words that we need to look at for this for answering this question. Alright, so what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So when you discover something. 
        - OK. Instead of a general sense, what are they using for the water? OK. OK. I mean, they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon.
        - Um, I guess.
        - when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind Jazmin.
        - Um lets see. I was looking at...Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing.
        - Alright. Is there anybody who wants to share the answer with us. What is, what does the word equipment means? Yes, Oliver?
        - Finding it but planning it for the first time.
        - Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water. I know they can look at the water with the microscope. But how did they discover the water
        - We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for.
        - Okay, so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon. 
        - Um, well, I mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon, without the oxygen tanks, you know,
        - so before we dive into the question I want to ask one of you, what is your understanding of the word equipment, what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights.
        - And here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists.
        - Ok I I used equipment in my answer, so I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - And that and what do you think about that. Does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon.
        - We know that we're looking specifically for equipment and the equipment is used to discover water on the moon. So thank you for that. Thank you for answering the question.
        - Good job. Excellent word in the question and it's the action, we are going to look for it. 
        -  What equipment is used right? 
        - what are some key words.
        - So our key word here is equipment and discover.
        - So i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself.
        - Okay, I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good. 
        - um like, we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text.
        - yup Chris, do you think there are any other words in the question that you would circle, in addition to those.
        - REach Every Reader: Ok, ok. 
        - Discover the water
        - Thats why I think mine is right teacher, because I mean they did use that one, and I think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water.
        - But the question that I'm asking is what What piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different, um, they used a different source of equipment.
        - I would say, when you hear the word equipment, it makes me think of a tool.
        - Yes, that is a very good question. So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically
        - you're right no very good job and having it split, how can that help, how is that valuable.
        - Okay, so the question is asking us about discovering water on the moon, and where are we going to find the answer.
        - You're right, Farrah. You can quote someone that said something, or you can quote what the author says, what the text says. It doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text. It could just be anything that's written on the text.
        - Oh Okay, that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves, they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it.
        - Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover all right there. What do you think buddy.
        - This question was specifically looking for 
        - yeah it's like something that you use to do something. Like in PE class, coach always says okay go get the equipment and then we get like the balls and thing.
        - But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water. 
        - Okay they're not in the story Okay, so this is a good, this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right.
        - And discover is like when you find something
        - so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water.
        - So what do you guys think the question is asking for.
        -  which I think is an awesome keyword because, although discover and water are also great keywords.
        - Well, it's like, um, maybe. I mean, they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water, but they would need to have oxygen tanks.
        - But how did they find that ice is the question.
        - Very good. Now what about the word discover
        - What equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said Farrah is what they were looking for So yes, i'm also going to write your word down as well.
        - Yes, but that's what I said. I said NASA sent a small machine. And that's the one, right there. So what's wrong with my answer?
        - So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon. What, what are you looking for?
        - Now, the specific question was what kind of equipment they used to dig up the water or find that water with, and that was the Rover. Remember that?
        - key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water
        - But that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and I know you circled the same thing as Farrah, but I want to hear from you.
        - Like other than other than equipment? Like discover. 
        - And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water.
        - Okay, well, you know, I think these words are going to really help us when we're looking. We're looking for this information in the test. So the first thing is, um,
        - Okay, okay, okay. So thanks, teacher, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us.
        - discover great and Farrah Do you know what another word for discover might be.
        - So we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now.
        -  so and which equipment did they use?
        - So um, for example, if I was going to start if I wanted to discover a new element or a new planet Luis we've been learning, you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right So if I, what do you think that means?
        - Yes, I think equipment is a great word to circle.
        - What are the ways that it's being used.
        - Okay, so what is evidence
        - And maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's all about your opinions as long as you support it.
        - turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask
        - Okay, so first one off of the key words that are used to cope
        -  it's kind of a two part question, if you think about it, because you're weighing out what would be valuable about the water to the astronauts like
        - um So the question is, is there evidence and you said no, not for a long time, so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage.
        - Right. And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water.
        - But let's look more at that question. So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?
        - But remember how we circled we did circle equipment, but we also circled the world's water and discover so we're looking for pieces of equipment.
        - can either you guys tell me what discover means.
        - So does everybody know what the word equipment means?
        - yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something 
        -  But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters.
        - Okay, so friends let's think we all seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's A couple of words that I really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something?
        - it's like facts.
        - Because I think, judging by some of your responses. I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon. So can you give me
        - As i've been saying to everybody those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really, really important when finding the answer in the passage 
        - That helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer.
        - Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that.
        - So everybody understands the question. Can somebody explain the question to me real quick?
        - Yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover, oh!
        - but i'm going to pick the one that Farrah mentioned about equipment.
        - Hey, oh, are you know teacher. I just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch
        - But our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility. Our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars.
        - I picked discover
        - I wonder, it's asking about the equipment. So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it. So we know where it was. But now we're asking about the machine.
        - so when we think about equipment and we know that scientists used equipment to get water off the moon, what does that mean to you.
        - um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that.
        - let's think back to the question right, what do we specifically want our equipment to do.
        - Yeah, now Oliver. Can I challenge your thinking, what is what is equipment mean do you do, you know,
        - So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage
        - So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon. What is that question asking?
        - They have to investigate 
        - That scientists use. But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph. It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon.
        - Yes, definitely. We need to know that we're looking or what's where we find and what equipment was used to find water. Anything else anybody
        - a microscope.
        - So what was the piece of equipment that was used to find water.
        - Okay, so um let's see I also wanted, before we begin, I really wanted to clarify that the word equipment means a necessary item that is used for a specific purpose, such as discovering water on the moon.
        -  So we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use
        - Okay, great. So the three of you guys have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So who can tell me what is discover mean?
        - I like how you said discovered that is correct. Discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question. Okay guys, so let's come back together as a group.
        - So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves. So what does it mean to be valuable Farrah.
        - Okay, well, there's another word story. It's a tool, a scientific tool. So that's how I know the microscope is right, cuz that equipment but but I think it's machine because that's what I had. And that's equivalent to so I don't know what my answer is wrong.
        - So I see from based off of our answers Farrah Oliver and Luis you guys all did a great job of understanding that you know from our question you know where we're looking for equipment.
        - In this text and thinking about the question, who do we need to focus on? Luis.
        - And remember, we're looking for equipment.
        - I'm well I convince everybody that I'm like I'm the best at Minecraft ever
        - However, the question is asking, how did they find the water. So they use it to look at the water, but what did they use to find the water?
        - Now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for.
        - Discover that might be a very important word too. okay so everyone is a circle of equipment and discover
        - Okay, so thank you. So now we have discover water and equipment. Okay, so let's think about it. So now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon.
        - The scientists.
        -  Does anyone want to talk about those keywords again who's got a key word for me Luis.
        - let us look back at the words. So we talk about discover and we talk about equipment. Okay. So what is an equipment we say it's a?
        - So we think of convincing evidence. What does that mean to you, Farrah.
        - So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember.
        - Excellent Harris and that is when you find something. So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon.
        - but what did they use it first to discover it so
        - To look at something, but to discover you're going to, you know, look for. 
        - But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural. It could be more than one. So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there. A Luis Do you think that's a good idea. It talking about more than one piece.
        - So in our response we're going to look for a piece of equipment that specifically us to discover water.
        - Good discover. So we have equipment we have water we have discovered, we put all those things together.
        - Instruments did they use 
        - Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question. So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out.
        - The key words in the question where to discover the water. What did they use in that one, that one tool. 
        - Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water
        - Mm hmm. That's a good point, that's definitely an important piece of the question. I was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that I was looking at is what goes on with equipment
        - And then Farrah to go to yours, I think that's also a key word because that's telling us the action that the equipment is doing so, we need a piece of equipment that's going to discover and to pull it all together Chris, we need to discover water right.
        - I think the questions asking us, okay, so it says... Scientists discovered the water and then like what equipment did they use to do that.
        - So we could reward that you find in the text, what equipment they used.
        - So, for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt? So when I look at that question, there are a couple of very important words that question.
        - Sure. I think that um, you know, earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article, 
        - That's, that's true. So it's a new. It's new to you. It's new to whoever finds it. That's absolutely true. 
        - Because it's an action word?
        - However, that's not the question here is, and if you read the question. The question states or asks you what equipment, equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And to discover the water.
        - But it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is even. 
        - So what we need to look at in our, in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time, right.
        - Okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon, and so on. Well, I said it was the microscope, because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it. You need a microscope to see it.
        - Um, yeah, I was just thinking like, Well, I went to NASA with my dad so I know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, and I guess I was like that when we talked about like what equipment. It feels like that's missing from the, from the reading or I don't know. Like, that seems like it's important
        - So yes, that is what equipment is. Equipment is just some tools or machines that we use to decide to do an action 
        - they said, what did they use to find it.
        - You know what the word discover means? Yes Oliver?
        - Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you
        - I was gonna say I think Oliver and I were talking about this, that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that.
        - So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question. The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water
        - Okay, now we were looking at the word discover right and we said the word is. What does the word discover means
        - You remember, if you look Oh well, it's.
        - All right, so in order to so we already have our background information, we know that we're looking for equipment or tools that's going to help us find water on the moon.
        - That equipment is machine.
        - So what does that mean in terms of what scientists are using to get water, what does the equipment mean def.
        - That would be very beautiful, very. Did you find that in the text Jazmin.
        - facts yeah yeah so it's facts, information, details that can help. So and then is there, so is there facts that can show if water is valuable. what does the word valuable mean?
        - And I want to specifically look at the question. It says, Is there convincing evidence. 
        - So craters full of water means what they found. But we're asking what equipment was used. So, what tools do they use to find those craters.
        - Oh yeah yeah.
        - Another way to say or state. This question is
        - That's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question. So the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so
        - Is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine, it was still a piece of equipment right that they used
        - yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water, but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know.
        - Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful. So this is asking could water from the moon be useful. Okay.
        - Can someone raised their hand and offer to explain it for us?
        - Well, your answer was correct. It was. That's one of the machines that they use was the rover to explore the moon's surface, to be able to locate the particles of water, which we would have to look at through a microscope
        - And so, for this question because we're talking about what scientists used to discover water.
        - So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage. So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment. Did they use to discover water.
        - If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking
        - convince me that
        - I don't, I guess. No, I guess not
        - Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon.
        - And we're going to discover evidence and proof. Very good. Alright, so, Jazmin. She's exactly right. Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?
        - The particular equipment that they, the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Well, so we're looking for what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. 
        - Right. So you weren't convinced, but the question. Listen to the word, and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - Well, in my answer, I, I talked about the equipment. It's me, Farrah. I said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to, to look really closely.
        - Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,
        - We're looking for a piece of equipment.
        - Right. So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water.
        - Jazmin, what is discover mean
        - So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for all five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage.
        - But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is. Want to know what did they use to find that water.
        - I think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you guys all said: equipment to discover water.
        - Yeah, I think that sort of makes sense. I feel like, well, so how did they, how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it.
        - Share what it means, with each other.
        - All right. Now, what, what does it mean if something is valuable.
        - And the word equipment. What does that mean, um, talk to yourselves about it for me. The word equipment discuss what it means.
        - because I think of machines and equipment and in us in the same way, I think that those words are synonyms um.
        - So now we get to figure out with the equipment was
        - Okay, so I saw the part where I found it in the story where I i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two, and it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, oh what equipment is used to find water.
        - And then discover is another big word in there and discover means, how did they find water. So find something or know that it exists on the moon.
        - So it looks like you guys have come to the understanding that the question is asking what equipment did scientists use
        - Oh that's good, yeah yeah. You know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article 
        - And then look for equipment that helped to discover water. So those are your key words. 
        - That's true, but the question is asking what equipment.
        - Mean
        - So equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to.
        - So something I want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and Jazmin you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so.
        - So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable. Okay, so what do we think valuable means
        - Okay, so I see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable Do you know what the word valuable means.
        - What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be Farrah.
        - what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read, so I want to turn now to some of your responses.
        - And that's okay um if we think back to Jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and, if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water.
        - That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, yeah, actually, I agree with Farrah. I said, equipment and discover as well.
        - Good, so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object. So when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon. So when we read this passage. We know that water has been found on the moon. And then we need to find the equipment. 
        - Very good and Farrah. What do you think the most important word in that question is
        - yeah so we're looking for equipment that you should discover water on the moon
        - The fact that water on the moon is being discovered. So now that we know these two things we know what we're looking for a while reading the text 
        - Water on the moon.
        -  But there is another another word that I want to talk about it.
        - Yeah okay that actually. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. So like it's. Yes. That makes sense.
        - However, if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. That's our buzzword right there, discover the water. So if we go back up and we see that
        - Yes, the answer is yes. I'm the question, however, access to think about, um, is there convincing evidence. Can someone tell me what evidence means
        - Unfortunately, we have to go on to the next group, but thank you.
        - Indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking
        - What's the evidence mean.
        - Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope. Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon. 
        - Okay, great. So you said discover means to find right and equipment means a tool. Right. And the question is asking you to identify the equipment that they used to discover. Or we could say the tool that they use to find the water. Okay.
        - I want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right, we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically. 
        - Did everyone hear that we're looking for one piece of equipment 
        - Or how can it be useful.
        - um discover discover the water
        - I like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the Moon. Very well done
        - but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment. Did they use to search for water on the moon. Specifically, right.
        - But what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon, and maybe use your texts to answer that question.
        - So putting that together.
        - The evidence that we put out here is wrong, it is valuable, but then, how do we get that water is also another question, we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing. Chris just something else to add to the class.
        - The key word discover water on the moon. Right. The key phrase there. And so we're not looking for just any scientific equipment that it's used out in space. We're looking for this specific one. This article says discovered the water on the moon, which in this case like Luis and Jazmin had said, is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Okay, um, let us look back at the question.
        - Good alright, so we see we have different pieces of the context of what we're trying to find here, so the main part of the question is what equipment, did they use to find the water.
        - Another example of a word for equipment, Oliver.
        - Okay, so let's talk about this Jazmin your answer was that NASA sent a small machine right, and I think we can all agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right.
        - Okay so Chris your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon. I had a they did find craters full of water. But the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased. so when the Lunar orbiter actually got there.
        - Well, for the question. It's asking exactly what they used to discover water on the moon,
        - Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, guys, I want you guys to
        - Well, I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits.
        - So the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So let's think about the words in this. Equipment usually means tools or systems.
        - Evidence evidence, our teachers always asked
        - We're talking about discovering the water. Yes. Chris.
        - I think that's a really great response you guys I think equipment is one of the most important words in the question.
        - Exactly. In an equipment, like you said, Farrah is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon, right.
        - Yeah, so the question is looking for a piece of equipment that's what the answer needs to be
        - It's like to to find something
        - What tools or equipment was us.
        - I'm like something you can use or something that you need like valuable is, you know, like, yeah, like something that that you want.
        - yeah that's very good Farrah so as you just said, you guys are looking for the water, so if you go into the text and find the similar word to looking for or discover it's going to be investigate, 
        - Ok, ok. 
        - So they do use oxygen tanks. But for this, we're wondering what they're using for the water, you know? So we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use, we're thinking what are they using for the water.
        - Do you remember what equipment do you use to find it?
        - Find.
        - Does anyone know what the word equipment is?
        - Oh, they say, simple Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Yes. Now with them what the moon right there. Did they when they were on the moon, looking for things on the moon, for sure. Now when you discover something. Have you looked at some when you discover something new. Does that mean you've already looked at it before.
        - You got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do.
        - So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?
        - But for this specific question, we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon. 
        - Okay. I think it's saying like, I'm like, um, what, what kind of things did the astronauts use to find
        - Or what do they sent to investigate.
        - Yeah, all those things are really important. And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that. But in this article. What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right
        - What part of the question, did you pull out as being the most important part
        - A word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now.
        - Back, here on earth. And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me. It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question.
        - But you said, my answer is right, my answers in paragraph two.
        - Okay, so then what equipment that they use to find the water. 
        - Yeah, and it's okay so it's asking what equipment.
        - It's like when you find something, or when you when you when you find something
        -  I understand. Yeah, so they they found it using the Lunar Orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope. So it was like two different things. They say, I understand.
        - What you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water, the key words in here, I think are equipment and to discover water on the moon.
        - Luis what is convincing for you.
        - But we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon. 
        - Chris, it's equipment and also discover. 
        - How could that be beneficial how could that be valuable.
        - Yeah, yeah, I guess you could like, and I guess it's like, um, I guess just wondering, like, did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe. You know what I mean?
        - So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water. So what does equipment main guys
        - Um, oh, okay, okay.
        - Now for this particular article that we're looking at. We are focusing on the specific action of locating water.
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. First of all, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means. So can anybody give me a synonym for the word equipment.
        - Okay, Chris what does convincing mean?
        - Good. Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and. Do you guys know what discover means
        - Well, that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon.
        - So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water. 
        - It's an action word, yes, because what, what are we doing? What is the question asking?
        - yeah So what we can say what tools or what.
        - And our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon. 
        - So what kind of things. So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment. So first of all, I want to make sure
        - They did find water. But the question wants to know what equipment did they use
        - Exactly. Chris when you hear the word equipment, what comes to mind.
        - We're trying to discover it. We're not trying to look at it, Chris, did you have something to tell me
        - So if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope.
- intent: r210.3
  examples: |
        - Oh. So is my answer wrong?
        - Or is there a better answer?
        - But did the microscope actually find the water?
        -  Well, I mean I guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what I was thinking.
        - No, it's not. It's, you just need to support it.
        - so with That being said, they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely, but then does that help us? 
        - I can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - yeah. So do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger?
        - Yeah. When you say, how would I broaden, what would that look like?
        - So here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that, based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do, you still think that there is a crater full of water? what do you think?
        - um well, I mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks, but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon. 
        - Sorry, sorry.
        - Do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert? Do you think there's water on the moon, a lot of water?
        - Well, I guess I was just gonna ask if
        - Well, I mean, no. They didn't use them to discover water on the moon, but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon.
        - Which one, do you think is correct: microscopes or lunar orbiters?
        - Oh, um, I guess not. 
        - Maybe I didn't really read it.
        - Okay awesome, alright Oliver. so your answer was just circling the same as Farrah. is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer?
        - Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?
        - Chris, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer?
        - I see. And as you're reading. Is there anything that you think you might want to add to that?
        - Well, I know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane, you know, they weigh our suitcases. And so, um, but I know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space. So
        - That's really, really cool. Do you think that NASA used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon?
        - What I want you to look for right, so you pulled out the word of discover. does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else? is it just one equipment to find it? are we using it to discover it? think about that.
        - I got it right from the text in part two. it says NASA send a small machine.
        - Yeah, so I underlined. Let's see, when I looked at it, I underlined equipment and
        - Well, I read it, I read the whole thing. But that was the piece of equipment that I thought because a microscope is like a tool.
        - Well, I, since you were telling Jazmin the thing that she said was was the right one, then I think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter.
        - Okay. And as you're reading, What are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add?
        -  I guess the article.
        - Oh well, um, I actually went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like Luis was saying and masks and suits.
        - So Deb. What is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like, what can you expand on your answer. A little bit.
        - But did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon?
        -  Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at?
        - Absolutely. So Oliver if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence?
        - Okay i'm still kind of confused.
        - Yes. Okay. So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but
        - That's a really good question.
        - Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that.
        - Okay, okay, thinking about that.
        - I want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists, be able to use the microscopes on the moon?
        - um I mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and I know that that means moon.
        - Yes, but I'm going to challenge you for a minute. Can I challenge you, as a detective.
        - I could just say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Oh, so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water.
        - But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope.
        - And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used. So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it. But let's think about what else they used
        - Do you underline
        - So if you look into your statement. Does that answer the question.
        - But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?
        - Well, I mean i'm Jazmin just said, the machine.
        - So a microscope is a piece of equipment that does something, but does it discover so think about that piece of feedback and see how it applies to your work.
        - From earth no way.
        - Do you think that your answer answers that question.
        - right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right.
        - Do you think that they would use both parts one part, what do you think?
        - Did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Those are all great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right?
        - That's right. What else, what other purposes. Does this takes point two for that answer.
        - To discover water.
        - to breathe of course. they can't survive on the moon without them.
        - I mean, I'm
        - Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great. I'm glad that you could acknowledge that. It's just the oxygen tank. Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?
        - You only circled water. What about you Luis you're one who hasn't shared yet. What did you circle? 
        - Yes. And in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer.
        - I'm still kind of confused.
        - Farrah and Oliver have your answers changed at all. After discussing Chris's Jazmin's and Luis's
        - Well gotta be the Lunar orbiter 
        - Yeah, I think what's interesting, because I do think that it could be valuable. Maybe sure I see that in the reading.
        - So what words are what equipment has mentioned.
        - How could we restate this question. 
        - um Okay, so I was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at, but now I think it's the Lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with.
        - yeah I yeah I.
        - Well, there's definitely water but
        - But we're we're expanding our thinking. We want to learn more. Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon.
        - Chris, how can you change your answer?
        - You're right. But the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks. Do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water?
        - That would make your answer spectacular.
        - Um, did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water?
        - Right, so it can be used for what else
        - Very good, so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this, to try and find all of that water.
        - Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked        - you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable.
        - Used it to look at the water.
        - So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there.
        - I can help help cars malls own could be stopped for spacecraft. It could be a gas station.
        - So I know that Jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so I guess i'm trying to think about why.
        - Scientists phone creators for water on the moon.
        - Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have
        - Okay um
        - It looks really closely.
        - circled to but the one I circled i think is right. So I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water.
        - Well, I guess, I guess I'm still
        - Um, I guess. Yeah, that sounds like they use the Lunar Orbiter to help find the water, but I don't know if I would have picked it the first time.
        - So they would use the oxygen breathing. Now what about the hydrogen part of it. Why would the hydrogen be useful for
        - No. No, I guess not.
        - So what else could you put in your answer?
        - That is also used to find water on the moon.
        - Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important. Now try to think about that next time. Okay. Yes, Jazmin.
        - You want me to read it again or
        - Absolutely. That's a great answer. So your initial answer kind of got started on that process. You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen.
        - Right. So what would the use of being able to split the hydrogen and oxygen apart? What benefit would that give the astronauts?
        - Perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer NASA send a small machine, if you are going to level that up like a video game, if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer, how might you get a little bit more clarity there.
        - Farrah and Oliver are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first.
        - astronauts could do what with the water
        - Oh, well, okay, so I went to NASA. And I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Luis Do you have anything. Have you thought of an answer. Yeah.
        - That is true. Is there a title of that machine. Is there a name of that machine in number two?
        - Luis What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer.
        - Is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water.
        -  and I really want you guys to just circle um in your responses, the equipment that you that you answered in the the question with, okay, 
        - Yeah, that makes sense. I understand. 
        - Yet, that's right. They use it to examine the water. So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it.
        - Can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water. If we look at I'm at point two. And we read past that first sentence.
        - yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really, really small like you can't see them um just in real life, you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small.
        - Luis Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question.
        - Right. But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?
        - Oh yeah, okay.
        - So let's think. was the Lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water.
        - Oh, I just underlined it that's the Lunar orbiter machine.
        - Yeah, discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first, what are they asking?
        - Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?
        - Do you think--
        - Yeah. And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you. I'm gonna say Jazmin.
        - wow they need the tanks to stay alive, while they discover water on the moon.
        - But is that the only thing that they sent, the only thing that they used
        - You know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment, because I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the Microscope is the tool that they use.
        - can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?
        - My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split. What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you.
        - I don't remember.
        - I circled the same thing. I circled equipment and water.
        - It seems like that'd be pretty hard.
        -  as well, he then said there's no astronauts so no.
        - Because if I was somebody that didn't read the text I could think of small machine was anything right?
        - In why microscope wasn't the best choice.
        - Oh, the lunar obiter. 
        - Um, yeah, to go to space. I figure you got to have a lot of stuff.
        - Yes, there could be and that would be great for for another reason. But let's look back at if we have people on base. Don't they need oxygen to breathe.
        - Luis, and Jazmin. Do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer.
        - They look for the water on the moon.
        - so Chris, how do you feel about your response at this point.
        - Well, because there's no oxygen is based on the astronauts would need them, or else I couldn't breathe up there, they need them to survive.
        - Okay, well, I mean I guess it sounds like the right answer is, you know, lunar orbiter um, and that's in the text, but I kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too.
        - Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?
        - I might use oxygen tanks to breathe.
        - Right, so the microscope helps us see things that is really small, but Not necessarily found the water on the earth right?
        - So if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon, like all the rest of our friends here said, think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon.
        - Okay, did you have any different thoughts.
        - This can anybody does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon. They might actually help out astronauts?
        - yeah all right Jazmin, how can you include those into your answer?
        - So we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that. But I really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step, maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut.
        - wow Okay, I guess, I guess, they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to.
        - OK. So the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit.
        - Perfect anything else.
        - Well, I I really like what you just said about playing different roles, and I think it's I think it's that because it sounds like.
        - The small pieces of ice. So did the Lunar Orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water?
        - So, hmm, is this patient, very large.
        - What kind of small machine did they send?
        - Well, I guess, in part two. It talks about a machine, but I don't really understand why my answer is wrong.
        - But it just says that they found evidence that there was water. Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there. Does that mean that there's a lot?
        - Because a small machine could be anything. It could be
        - Totally know it's, it is important, but I would like you to look for the other one too, okay?
        - Okay, so I saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing I saw is that, like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important.
        - There you go. Okay, so Oliver, where were they finding this water?
        - Lunar orbiter.
        - So Farrah excellent analysis. But they did need the microscope to look closely at it, but for that first discovery, what did they need?
        - And anyone else do want to show you your keywords.
        - Okay, water could be one. Do you see any other words that could be important.
        -  um astronauts are a type of scientist?
        - Oh, well, what if I use the keyword like I could said I could say NASA sent A small machine to discover the water
        - but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one.
        - Yeah, yeah. I think that fast, the probably the one that I was talking about, I guess.
        - Oh, I gotta do this, too?
        - Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment Chris Chris does your answer mentioned equipment.
        - Oh yeah. Okay, so the underlying
        - But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future.  Is there enough evidence. You know, you know, at least going forward. If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there.
        - Okay, the oxygen tanks allows them to breathe better when they're on the moon.
        - yeah, but do you agree that if it was ready, that it would be awesome to have it on the moon 
        - Improvement and tell me what changes. Did you make
        - Right and is that what we're looking for is a.
        - Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or
        - However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?
        - Well, they said it's really small. So if you don't have the microscope, you can't see it.
        - Yeah, right.
        - Now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is, do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water?
        - So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and Oliver. I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not. But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource.
        - And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope. What did it show us
        - Perfect. Now, what was the microscope attached to?
        - You need to go into a little bit more detail on it. 
        - there's the possibility there's what Oliver said what he said, is there any others, that you have found.
        - Has anyone is thinking changed.
        - Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had.
        - And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall. But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon. 
        - Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits
        - Oh yeah, I have an answer.
        - yeah, I guess so.
        - Are you are you asking, are you telling.
        - Oh yeah well, I guess, I just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering.
        - Um, well, maybe discover
        - Nope nope nope nope nope nope Chris. You didn't even say
        - Okay, why did scientist us to discover why
        - some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that 
        - Well, normally use the microscope to see the things, um,
        - But does that say, that's what they sent
        - Luis so, can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space, but what do you think they use to discover water.
        - It makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water. So why why I don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped
        - So is it going to have a moon garden.
        - But I'm still kind of confused.
        - SO I'M Farrah in your response. You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does.
        - On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay 
        -  Anyone else have any information that they can share with me, Oliver. Go ahead.
        - Because
        - Teacher : Yes, it's very, very cool. But is that equipment. Were craters equipment?
        - Okay. Oliver, what did you circle?
        - So thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and all the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it. Do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot.
        -  well.
        - Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing Luis.
        - So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?
        - To drink or bath.
        - Um, yeah, I guess.
        - But it's even more valuable because they
        - I guess it doesn't say that NASA sent it. 
        - Um equipment.
        - Yeah, and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water, but do you think it helped us to discover that water.
        - On what your answers could be changed, how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what I was expecting from you guys who'd like to go first.
        - , maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - That's it.
        - But if there was water on the moon, but that help us.
        - And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what Farrah said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?
        - yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?
        - yeah yeah it's microscopic.
        - But like I was discussing in the last session, about what we thought was science fiction a long time ago, like with Wrinkle in Time, it can actually happen, possibly, in our lifetime, to where they're able to do that.
        -  Farrah. Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future.
        - So Chris after, after reading, paragraph three, do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes?
        - Yeah, so that's a great answer. But I'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that.
        - Luis Did you find anything was talking about oxygen.
        - that's perfect, do you know any other tools.
        - No, no, I would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story.
        - And one way
        - And just like Luis, he had mentioned some as well. They use a lot of equipment. While that's true, is that what they used?
        - I circled equipment and the moon.
        - Okay, so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, I see people looking up. So I think we're gonna I'm gonna ask for some provide answers. So maybe, maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt
        - So Jazmin I know your answer was that they sent small machines, but you know what those machines are called Do you remember.
        - Teacher : Right, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but that doesn't necessarily say that NASA sent a microscope to look really closely, it does it.
        - Lunar Orbiter I guess. 
        - So does that mean, like, I'm like, you have to use a word from the story.
        - On the moon.
        - Yes. So I saw that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Why would it be helpful, though, to have it on the moon, rather than to bring it with them on a space shuttle right Chris was just telling us that it's very heavy.
        - Is there any other words that are important. Yes. Chris.
        - So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water
        - You know what else did they use
        - You're right you did talk about the water. But let's look at our discussion question. 
        - Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space. Does that tell us
        - I guess, I thought that's what it meant, but now that you mentioned it, it doesn't exactly say that.
        - a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, Farrah. Did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling The key word in the question?
        - So I when I went to circle the key words I basically ended up with the same answer. And that's because I was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water. And I still think it's the microscope. So I thought, extra hard about it, but I still have the same answer.
        - Oh, like the stuff they say in the story.
        - yeah yeah so so what what does everyone else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the Lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah Chris.
        - I would say it's like a thin marker.
        - Good. Okay. So you did you found a piece of equipment you found a tool that was used, but did it say that this microscope was used to find the water to begin with. Was this the first machine that they use to find the water
        - That needs to be clarified,
        - I'm not totally sure
        - anywhere.
        - Um
        - yeah but the story says that that it it'll take a long time.
        - It
        - But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer.
        - On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?
        - They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy.
        - Nope.
        - Does anyone want to share what they circled
        - Oh no no.
        - Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?
        - yeah yeah cuz i'm this one, the one I just read says they'll look for ice deposit in a large polar crater in my sentence says.
        - No, no, not not not now.
        - Oh right right, so I wonder Chris if they're if they're wearing all those things and they're using their lunar orbiter, then what how did they use the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon?
        - Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about
        - So now Luis going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use, but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon.
        - Okay, so, um, I heard that you when you're talking to Farrah and Oliver and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story. So I took out the oxygen tanks and I just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode.
        - I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your group members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions. How do you guys think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed
        - Very much and Farrah. There's one more.
        - Well, what oxygen tanks would do, was they would have the astronaut stay alive, while they were looking for the water.
        - yeah so Okay, so I think when I look at it, one of the things that jumped out was.
        - so Chris we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that.
        - Well, I guess I'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer, but I guess I still think microscope is a good answer too.
        - Luis Would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers.
        - No, not in that paragraph. I don't see anything about equipment.
        - Were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water.
        - Oh man okay i'm telling i'm.
        - The small machine and the scientific tool.
        - To find that answer.
        - Oh, so the word I picked from the question, but I thought was most important was equipment.
        - Just to kind of circle back a little bit. I think a Farrah. Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there. How do you feel about your answer. If you were giving it another shot at it. What might you say instead
        - Like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used.
        - So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me.
        - So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water?
        - So if there is a base on the moon,  if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes ,which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon.
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So let's look at our question again and see if that answers. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But let's say for example the do you need. Do you need water to live on Earth.
        - So, Jazmin that you said that NASA sent a small machine. So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment. Did you find
        - Farrah. Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today.
        - Great. So do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is
        - yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit NASA or are we looking somewhere else for our answer.
        - Okay art. So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen. Did you hear that somewhere else.
        - Right, what, why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though.
        - So do you see Jazmin how a Microscope, microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space.
        - Are there any other words you would use to describe this marker?
        - Yes, I think they're really cool. So if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away, just like the water on the moon that far away.
        - In a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope.
        - the question sayas, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Do you have a question. Do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question.
        - but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text.
        - awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit Jazmin to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?
        -  I don't I don't know.
        - Yes, they would have to do that. But they would have to work on their atmosphere, right?
        -  Oh lets you see things that are really small.
        - Farrah. How could you be more specific in your answer.
        - So what do you know about a microscope.
        -  Remember, he uses a microscope. Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope.
        - All it showed us
        - Um, well, I see a couple of pieces of equipment and the text, you, you, you're right. There isn't anything about the oxygen. But they have talked about a lunar orbiter and I talked about the the microscope, like what Farrah said
        - If we had a microscope in our classroom. Do you think we would be able to see all of the water on the moon.
        - So, yes you're 100% correct So if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover all of the water on the moon, or just bits and pieces of that water.
        - I would tell you. So do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon.
        - Maybe, but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there.
        - Do you remember what it was called
        - So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response.
        - Oh Okay, well, it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look, but I guess what I had been thinking is, how can you find it if you can't see it.
        - When they're        - Do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits?
        - Now, Oliver. I have a question for you. You said I circled the same as Farrah. Did you actually read the article?
        - yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon.
        - Great job Farrah. so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all?
        - So I put in for my answer. I underlined equipment.
        - Do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common
        - I think they use both parts.
        - do we remember what the small machine was called.
        - Right. So what does the oxygen tank do Luis
        - Okay So did we we read about those things in the paragraphs, though? Did they talk about that in the paragraph? 
        - Well my answer to begin with was the small machine. So I still think that's right. And I don't really see what was wrong with my answer. NASA sent a small machine.
        - I guess that's a good question. I guess it could be valuable in the future.
        - Right, so the microscope. If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope. However, scientists were not on the moon.
        - So what it, what word. Did you circle then.
        - I guess. No, I guess not.
        - Well, I guess, I pictured that at first when they said water on the moon, and I was picturing like big pools and lakes, but on that part yeah that part says it's so small, you can't even see it, so I guess I guess what I pictured wasn't quite in.
        - And they do use that, but I'm just like with Chris. I asked him, did they use that to discover the water
        - Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer. And she said, NASA send a small machine. And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?
        - Yeah, so I thought
        - My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon
        -  one thing we want to pinpoint, though, is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about.
        - Right now, you may not see a use for water being on the moon, but in the future, as we continue with our space journeys and explorations, then possibly water will be very, very valuable on the moon.
        - But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?
        - So can you tell us what to the oxygen tanks used for.
        - So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes Jazmin.
        - Very good. Does any of that equipment that you listed. Do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon.
        - So Chris, do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea, do you think we're ready to do that, you know, in a year you think we're set up for that well.
        - I will show like the whole drinking water thing.
        - And when you come out of that. I want you to have a revised answer.
        - No, I guess not, but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters.
        - Do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there.
        -  so i'm curious if any of you guys could look over paragraph two, to see if perhaps um any of you want to add to your response uh.
        - do you see the name of that tool there in the text.
        - I think it was in there um let me look.
        - So is that referring to any equipment, that the scientists found or used?
        - that's what I put in my answer um I did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah.
        - Okay, what is the question asking us
        - then Farrah, what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water.
        - Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read. Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article.
        - That's true. That is very true. Did people go up on the moon, though.
        - But the water. When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water.
        - yeah, I guess, because the question was what equipment right did they use, so I guess, I was talking about the craters because I was thinking that like that's where they had the water, you know, and I mean with the craters so, but the question is what.
        - Is that completely accurate.
        - Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?
        - So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon.
        - Right, they did and they did that through what equipment.
        - Farrah, you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct
        - Look back at paragraph. I don't know.
        -  and read it.
        - Oh, I, I heard that somewhere else.
        - yeah well, they would have to to stay alive on the moon.
        - So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers. I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it.
        - But is that all we use to get there and be able to observe said water?
        - Um, no. I guess before you use a microscope, you probably need something else.
        - That may not in depth. Can one of you tell me what words you guys underline
        - I circled discover
        - The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?
        - If we have oxygen but not this small machine, the Lunar orbiter, can we find the ice?
        - Jazmin, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response. Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit.
        - Um-        - um--
        - Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope Farrah.
        - Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right
        - To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water Luis do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon.
        - so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water.
        - So even though it's not ready yet Farrah, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future.
        - Yeah. So, does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer.
        - Um, yeah, I do. Because it's a scientific tool just like it says right there in part three microscope is a scientific tool. Um, yeah, so that's Aw.
        - No, no craters not equipment. But that's where they've had to find the water
        - Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage
        - Okay. Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think
        - Well, I was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks, because that was my answer. And I'm Chris was talking about how he wants to NASA. And so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff.
        - Oh, so like so, like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it. Is that right?
        - So do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors. Do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water?
        -  i'm really sorry but we have to go now.
        - It could be a computer later right
        - Is this convincing.
        - Right. And they have, what do you know, there's one more. I think
        - A lunar orbiter. So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, Jazmin?
        - Well, I guess I'm not sure like which equipment. Exactly. Because you could do a scanner or like, something like that. You know what I mean, like, I'm assuming they're like Probes stuff like that. So maybe you didn't need the microscope. I'm not sure.
        - So maybe your answer is already right but maybe I want a little more, maybe your answer is not really right. And you can just change it completely. So go back into the text.
        - Or is a more of once the water is found, then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount, what would you say.
        - So Oliver, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope.
        - um so let's try to combine some answers So what did they what did they use to get to the moon, in the first place.
        - hmm because thinking about Jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists.
        - Right so Jazmin, which tool. Do you think found the water. The Lunar Orbiter, or do you think the microscope did?
        - I think it's valuable.
        - lunar orbiter yep.
        - NASA sent a machine to discover water on the moon.
        - No, but but I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also have masks and suits.
        - So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks.
        - mm hmm and then what would you add to it? 
        - that's true yeah, and so I wonder if
        - I guess I guess not. If it's just evident to not the water. Um, but, you know, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how Luis was saying, but also masks and suits too
        - Exactly so in your response, did you name an equipment that discovers water.
        - Okay. So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?
        - There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?
        - But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me. 
        - yeah we thought so Chris and I both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for.
        - Jazmin. How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Farrah, did you Farrah and Oliver. Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes.
        - And I told you.
        - And the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from all your knowledge you already have.
        - Okay anyone else? any other words?
        - I wonder if we're missing some pieces, I think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon Jazmin like what about soil.
        - It says it's good. So it's good. I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information. But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable.
        - i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that all right, and then we're going to go around and talk about it.
        - yeah 
        - Oh, excuse me teacher, I was just thinking about the water on the moon, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - Absolutely Farrah I guess, I want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space.
        - I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and masks.
        - How are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it.
        - Oh um in that sentence, no.
        - Was that was the one you were looking at.
        - No, I forgot to put that part in.
        - And helps them breathe
        - Interesting. Um, I'm not sure I have to look at again.
        - Yeah. Oh, okay. So, I should say, I should say that in my answer. Should I should say Lunar Orbiter.
        - So do you think you could add something to your answer Jazmin to make it more complete in more correct.
        - Do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon.
        - The reading. I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it. Chris.
        - So did your original answer change in any way after working with Luis
        - Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response. The rest of the article?
        - Okay, so what was one of the keywords that are you circled, Farrah?
        - Do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned
        - Okay. And so, Farrah after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one. Do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool, or do you think the microscope is after doing more research?
        - So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything.
        - How you will make your answer more specific?
        - Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water.
        - I'm here. Yeah, they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so. So the answer's no.
        - Well, I guess, like, I mean, I guess you could say, like, you know, you said equipment like definitely microscopes, you know, it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at, because the water was was microscopic right.
        - Would anyone like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled.
        - Improve that in response. What could we do to improve that response.
        - yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope.
        - You can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope.
        - Or do you need more than that.
        - Yeah, we saw the answers. I think that, well, do you have any thoughts. 
        - After you thought, and you have a good solid thought let's share, what does that mean.
        - Oh, what a scientist use to discover.
        - yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water.
        - So Oliver, you also wrote your response about the microscope. So looking back at the text, are there any other details that you might want to include now.
        - Farrah, you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment, but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or.
        - Well, I know they were using it to look at it, because that's exactly what it says in the answer um.
        - Yes, you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right.  Does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon.
        - So Farrah would you want to maybe like how about Farrah and Oliver could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer.
        -  what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it.
        - Is I guess the one that Jazmin said
        - Farrah, and Oliver were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment.
        - Farrah, have you chosen a vocab word yet.
        - Ah, well I guess that's I kind of was thinking about what he was saying because I went to NASA with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them. So I guess I was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters.
        - It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing
        -  now they have room for what Chris?
        - um well, I guess I said oxygen tanks because I was kind of thinking it would help them find the water, because it would help them breathe.
        -  So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon.
        - is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes.
        - Luis, how can you change your answer?
        - So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable.
        - What type of equipment did scientists use to INAUDIBLE
        - awesome so Jazmin how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information.
        - Do you remember the name of the small machine.
        - So that's a good answer, Luis. You just need to go in a little bit more detail on that. OK?
        -  so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer.
        - Yes, so I see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon, but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit.
        - Are those pieces of equipment that you saw NASA used to discover water on the moon, or they used for a different purpose.
        - Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon. Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope.
        - and so do you think that if we look back in our texts, there's something that says  A piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope.
        - so can anyone explain to me how the water that was found on the moon, is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth.
        - But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon.
        - When we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water, though, do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks.
        - Chris. Have you found anything
        - that's true, but how does that relate to water.
        - Luis What
        - um well definitely not a microscope
        - so this finding Equator are saying that they found the Quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question.
        - So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope.
        -  Oh, oh no.
        - So do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together.
        - Okay, Farrah, which what, what, where did you circle or words.
        - Would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope.
        - I'm actually, I'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this. But we have to go to lunch. So before we go, though. I just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class, like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and I think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting. Like, thank you so much.
        - Well, yeah. What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?
        - Oh, and okay so so no it doesn't address that question because you know accident tanks are used to breathe, but I guess.
        - I mean yeah that makes that makes sense, what the said.
        - Where do we use a lunar orbiter?
        - Moving forward, this could be very valuable 
        - You didn't. You didn't actually name the machine, right.
        - yeah so um I love that you guys were thinking about them that equipment, because that is an important tool but  were they using it, the microscope to find it or to look at it.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, to look at it. Yeah.
        - yeah yeah This makes this makes a lot more sense now, it makes sense that the the machine the Lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense.
        - Okay um NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - um i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch.
        - Okay, so if you got to-when you revise your response, what do you think you'll change?
        - Umm, huh. 
        - because the microscope was a tool. In fact, so
        - Well, a microscope is a machine
        - so how can we add that into Jazmin's response.
        - Okay, and that's correct, do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon.
        - Machine was the lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, well, I mean I see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource, but then in the story, it says something different all right 
        - Oh, no, no, it talks about the craters not the equipment
        - well if there were astronauts they'd need them, but
        - Well, it says, I don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what Farrah read.
        - Discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part. 
        - so was there a word that you guys picked in your group that you got that you thought was important to a question.
        - Okay. I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct. Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question.
        - Yes. And because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer. So what do you think, how will you revise your answer to include the equipment.
        - And um well i'm I gotta admit I didn't really read this but I listened to the conversation and I heard myself and I heard lunar orbiter.
        - hey oh.
        - yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the Lunar orbiter and then the Lunar orbiter used a microscope.
        - Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water. It says that the whole time throughout the article. 
        - Farrah is usually right, and I also thought that too.
        - Well, I guess I could put more more like from the text, so I could add
        - Definitely, the Lunar orbiter.
        - So I circled water.
        - Can anybody else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water. Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?
        - Ah, I'm not sure.
        - What, what can you go into a little bit more detail for that.
        - So you said a small machine, but what some machine would you be talking about. 
        - So Luis You answered equipment like oxygen tanks. Do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water
        - teacher well Jazmin's looking I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        -  um, no.
        - Teacherr: So how could you look back
        - Before they saw the microscope?
        - Um, so do you. What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Right? So the microscope does help us see the water. But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place.
        - Yeah, yeah. Um, so
        - Right, so let's go back to your response real fast. You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?
        - So how can we add those into our answer?
        - Well, I mean it helps them breathe.
        - that's definitely an aspect of it. um So do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts.
        - Right, well yeah, take it literally essentially central to take a bath right it's essential to drink water.
        - So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer.
        - And I also want you to think about um if, after looking at the text, if you want to modify your response at all. does anyone feel like they want to modify their or change their answer.
        -  yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now.
        - So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail.
        - Well, I mean, how could you discover something if it's too small to see. You have to be able to see to find it.
        - Do they go to the moon? The astronauts? Or is it the machine was sent to moon? What do you think Chris?
        - Oh, well I guess what you said to Jazmin is it that is the Lunar Orbiter. So I guess I would say they use the Orbiter to find the craters full of water.
        - But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon. Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?
        - Okay, okay. Um, okay.
        - Well would I, I think I'd still keep the first sentence right?
        - Um, yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, well, okay. No, it wasn't about oxygen. It was just about ice and ice and water in this first part.
        - Where did they send it to did you include that Jazmin.
        - Um, depending on size. Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine.
        - Yeah, okay. So, do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer.
        - Lunar orbiter because, like you're already there.
        - Yeah, my name.
        - So an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like Chris said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe, do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay.
        - Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable.
        - Oh, there's more.
        - Okay. Um, so I was thinking about what everybody said, and I'm. Oh yeah, I would say. The thing about us breathing the oxygen to
        - yeah like they need the oxygen tanks, because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe.
        - RER: Yeah.
        - No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon.
        - Okay, so when we answer something. Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific. That way there's no confusion.
        - OK. So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you. I would like for one person in each group to share their answers with the group so Farrah and Deb, you want to view, give me what words you guys underlying the question.
        -   Asks a general question or makes a non-specific statement intended to prompt students to think about why student responses are incorrect/incomplete that does not require use of the text.
        - [Reads to herself] The moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Mr. Lawrence?
        - They will if, as if an astronaut went to the moon, they definitely would have to, but when we look at this, this text, do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon, or was it machines.
        - Yeah. So how would that be a valuable resource to have
        - Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine.
        - Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than Farrah's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story.
        - Um, yeah, I followed along. So I think like
        - Well, I noticed that he said.
        - Do you think that they're using those when they're using the small machine?
        - Well, in that one, it was talking about a microscope, and how it said the water is microscopic. Meaning you won't be able to see it. You need a microscope to look really closely at it.
        - I just would like the answer what the machine is called 
        - If they're on the moon, then I have to Christ you can't you can't be walking on the moon, without an oxygen tank you can't breathe.
        - It would help you to get to the moon right?
        - Yeah, which that really isn't telling us
        - You did kind of explain that you said that they need water. But why can't take a spring water with them. Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them. What do you say,
        - Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?
        - yeah they do so Chris Chris, I know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon Do you remember how they found them.
        - Oh, I mean, I can see I can see where they're coming from, but I still think that I was right. I said, not for a long time, you know,
        - Bus a small machine that could be anything. Couldn't it?
        - The lunar orbiter
        - So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool. But how did they discover it or another word. How did they find that water. So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - More clarity um level it.
        - Oh, okay, yeah. I guess they don't really, I guess they don't really say.
        - Yeah what equipment. Okay, and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it.
        - Okay, so for that, how would they get the microscope to the moon.
        - what's The purpose of this equipment.
        - What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about. How could we restate that question.
        - Oh, you mean---
        - Of plants.
        - Um, I did read the article, and I did circle the same thing though, like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but I heard what Farrah was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it
        - can you add another tool to that.
        - But in this case are we looking for information from your brain, or are we looking for information from the article?
        - Well, if you only read it once.
        - I guess not. Like, I guess they must have used they used it, but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask.
        - We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis.
        - How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a
        - But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon.
        - It does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, let's really see cuz I'm like I was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right. But actually, that makes a lot of sense. 
        - Did what important word or words did you circle in the question.
        - um well I guess what I was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because I was thinking like if you're gonna see the water, like the ice crystals they're really small, and so I was thinking like that's, the only way to see that.
        - Well, I don't know. I just saw it in the story, and that looked like that was the important thing. And I know I learned about it in science class.
        - Um, yeah. Um, there's definitely other things like I was working with Luis, and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks.
        - You are probably right, NASA does have a lot of money. But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?
        - um I would say.
        - All right, let's go to Jazmin Jazmin, how can you change your answer?
        - No, no, because, um, I don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water.
        - So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right.
        - Well, did they take a microscope to the moon.
        - The orbiter.
        - So according to that. Do we think they people were actually on the moon. At that time, or did they just send that machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter.
        - I just want a little bit of clarification on. 
        - Has everyone had a chance to reread the question in the passage?
        - So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water.
        - Okay, so I I read the whole thing again. And I think the answer is about the Lunar Orbiter, because I know that, um, I think, Chris said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ICE. And ICE just frozen water. And so that's why I think that's
        - Okay, so how could that be valuable for the astronauts.
        - um Jazmin's answer?
        - Right. What are we trying to make by Chris tanks and Luis's two elements. Oh.
        - yeah What was it called.
        - Um, let me see.
        - lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um, I guess, not because now, I guess.
        - How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?
        - But is that all that they used in order to find the water. I don't think it quite is 
        - but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is.
        - [Rereads to himself] Oh. No, it says the water they found was microscopic, meaning you would be able to see it if you're looking straight at it. Oh okay.
        - Okay. And so what is. I mean, what is water essential for. 
        - All right, you guys did an awesome job Jazmin after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers.
        - With the information that we just talked about all together.
        - A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember.
        - I. Yep. Okay. Um, so using those three words we picked, I would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope.
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Which piece of equipment, did they use if it's not a microscope.
        - Good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use. Jazmin you have a different one?
        - Beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment.
        - And that's one part of it. Do you remember any other parts from the reading.
        - Well, your answer is not completely wrong. You did say that NASA send a small machine, but can you tell me what that small machine is
        - Um, can I ask, how about Jazmin, do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit
        - Okay, and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's all from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so.
        - Um, yeah, I guess so.
        - So were there other things, that the astronauts used to look for water, other than the microscope?
        - yeah Do you remember what they used to find them.
        - i'm okay um NASA sent a small machine.
        - So you, how do you think if we took your answer. They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about.
        - Does that mean they already find the water?
        - So oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe. But what exactly helped the scientists find the water?
        - Well, I guess I'm not sure. Like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly?
        - That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon.
        - Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon. 
        - But what was the key word that help the scientists find the water on the moon?
        - To do what?
        - Do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon.
        - So why could it be yes.
        - Just the machines name right.
        - Okay, I think I get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks, but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water.
        - Well, I have the same answer as Farrah, and I remember when I was looking in the story, it was saying, the water they found is microscopic I'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so I figure, they must have brought a microscope to to see the water
        -  I know
        - Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use.
        - Um, so they found the water in polar craters.
        - The sentence and your previous answer.
        - Let's see, let me think about that. How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while. Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while.
        - Now, Farrah, did you see where it said the equipment.
        - Oh well, I guess, I was thinking, yes, because how can you find something if you can't see it.
        - Yeah, absolutely. Okay, so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined.
        - Well, because it sounds like, I guess. It sounds like there's a little less water, but there's not that much water, but there's just a little bit of water.
        - Question. 
        - Oh, Farrah, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down
        - Ah, I think it's got to be pretty big. Yeah, maybe.
        - Looking at that question now and looking at what you just read. We read in the text. Do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer.
        - Okay, scientists, is the whole that's the same.
        - Um, yeah, I guess, actually. Okay, so when when we talk about it together. Like, I guess you need the Lunar Orbiter. But, um, I guess it kind of still think it's like I kind of still think it's the
        - Yeah. Yeah, I read the whole thing and and I wanted to tell you when you were talking Luis about, you know, the oxygen tanks, that I went to NASA with my dad and so I know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, too.
        - Does anyone want to share what words they circled?
        - But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water.
        - So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon. So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?
        - Well, I guess I'm guessing not
        - No, because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water.
        - Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it
        - You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon.
        - I'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like I will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment, if you are doing those things.
        - yeah awesome Okay, so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part? 
        - Need you to narrow down your answer more specific. 
        - Yeah, I can see that. 
        - yeah Do you remember what a microscope is used for.
        - Luis. Did you figure out any answers. After giving yourself a little bit more time.
        - Hmm. Why do you think your answer is wrong.
        - Cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel.
        - Okay, what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem, it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use.
        - That we need to expand upon some of the answers.
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Again, we have to watch this. But, um, I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today.
        - Yes, absolutely. So I see that we have. Let's look at back at some of our answers. So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment. Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon Farrah?
        - I see like I gotta say, like, I gotta say the whole sentence like, you like work with Jazmin when she needed to say like the whole thing about the Lunar Orbiter and the small machine like I need to say like what my opinion is, and then I need to say like what it could be used, is that right?
        - um Do you remember where they were.
        - Well, I mean, if there's astronauts there.
        - So I do agree with you, but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker, do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon, instead of bringing it on their ship or now well, I mean if they could do it faster and quicker than.
        - and so i'm savannas answer was scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon do we think that answer the questions completely? Oliver.
        - Yeah. And so since they're small amounts are we going to be able to use it as use it like the amount of water that we use on Earth.
        - How they found them.
        - oxygen.
        - Oh yeah, I think in like, Sure, it could be very valued. It just seems like people, you know, like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see. And I just think it will be valuable. You know, long time.
        - What did you circle Jazmin.
        - We can drink it.
        - And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes Oliver.
        - I wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope, you need to have a sample.
        - I don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand.
        - Hold on you just said they haven't been to the moon yet?
        - It doesn't have enough water to grow things
        - Now, Oliver. You have the same answer as Farrah. Did you follow along with what we just went with
        - So they used, how can we
        - i'm so Chris, you said, water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship, other than its weight.
        - So what is the small machine called.
        - but also because the water is so small on the moon right?
        -  can you tell me a little bit more, what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same?
        - What the machine was right.
        - No, no it's a machine.
        - What might be the effect that where we just read a text one time 
        - Yes. Great. And I appreciate that you used the evidence from the text, but do think microscope is the best answer?
        - They used a microscope. But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space. Do you remember?
        - Do you know what the small machine was called?
        - Do you think that your answer answers the question, Chris.
        - So I want you to think about that a little bit okay and see if you can use the answer to that question revise your answer, thank you Chris alright if.
        - Well, I guess when I think about discovering the pot. I think like they used the microscope, because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water, unless they look through my school so I thought like, that's how they discuss
        - Well, no. I guess it's not in the text that they used it.
        - Okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell Jazmin that lunar orbiter is the right answer, and so I guess, I guess, I know that now, but I don't know um how I how I would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense.
        - That they use to find that water. So what would you add Chris to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment.
        - Sorry. Guys, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Okay. So does that say that that's what NASA sent though Farrah?
        - And I think Luis That you had told us about oxygen tanks. Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else.
        - that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because Well, I can look and see because i'm not really sure, is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing I guess I could second look at.
        - Well, I mean that part definitely just a little bit.
        - That's a great question. So when. So who thinks. Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage
        - Well I, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that, um, you know, scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks, and
        - Not sure
        - When you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer.
        - Do you now see what the name of that tool was called?
        - Okay, so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question.
        - Well, I mean like if I needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel I guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home. 
        - yeah I think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer, what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well.
        - Jazmin or Luis, did you have any other keywords.
        - But they do, they do, what exactly.
        - Yeah, I like that. Chris, do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there. Do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said?
        - Exactly, and do you remember what they do, what do they look for.
        - Well, I guess, I could I could just say that name the Lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, do you think, do you think take off for a spaceship could be easier without the weight of the water. 
        - No, that could be something valuable.
        - In the reading I didn't see anything that said anything about oxygen tanks.
        - Oh, I think, was in there.
        - Okay. Well, well, they were using the oxygen tank star for you.
        - So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything.
        - So Chris. When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us. How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters.
        - Right, so I think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response.
        - um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the Mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100%.
        - yeah yeah I agree that scientists did find some evidence that there was water on the moon, but do you think that the crater the craters are full of water?
        - Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank.
        - awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable.
        - Oh OK so it's kind of like they a tool like work together.
        -  Does anyone else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers.or revise I should say yeah Oliver.
        - What can the astronaut use
        - So, all right. So what do you think you can do to add to your answer.
        - As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that. It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade Farrah.
        - Like about the machine or about other equipment.
        -  does that machine have a name.
        - So that's going to be very valuable. So what else can be valuable there. It talks about in there.
        - um I mean there's probably some other staff what I know that if there are astronauts on the moon, they definitely have oxygen tanks.
        - me or anyone.
        - so what lets the scientists, know that the water is there.
        - Yeah, yeah. Okay, so then that's so. Okay, so then that's my answer so that they can breathe.
        - Chris. Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer.
        - Oh, oh i'm not sure I guess on the spaceship probably.
        - Like I'm thinking about, like, who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking. So like I think the microscope like, they definitely used it. And I think that's how they discovered it, but maybe my answers wrong.
        - The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?
        - So what is the answer to our question?
        - Yeah, maybe not. So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah, so I guess Chris also soften your answer. So if the water is microscopic Chris, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment.
        - Okay, well, did you read the the article that was with the question.
        - Ok, so if you had to redo your answer Jazmin What would you say now?
        - To find water.
        - So I said the water the scientists found was microscopic so
        - But what is our question asking us
        - Well yeah cuz you think about like what use it uses talks about a microscope right and microscope is small, right, or it could it be talking about, you know, oxygen tank or I wanted to know specifically if you knew what equipment they used, you know what I mean?
- intent: r210.4
  examples: |
        - And we unfortunately have to go to lunch. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you for really listening for answers and really making us feel like
        - Right okay. so that's assumption.
        - Was the microscope used to find water on the moon?
        - So that was it. The first thing that they send, and when they discovered this, I let me see the number.
        - Drinking
        - The fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right. 
        - but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph, it says, you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon.
        - You know, microscopic meaning small tiny right? so in order to to look at that in a larger sense they use the microscope.
        - Oh, they're water. They're water. 
        - Microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it If you were looking straight at it.
        - yeah so how did I get the water Chris?
        - um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine. why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one?
        - The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater.
        - Uh huh, OK. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. OK, so it's a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates.
        - Let's use evidence from our text.
        - That is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water, but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound?
        - The the fourth paragraph, which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question,
        - Luis Can you summarize what the paragraph said?
        - What was on the moon? Was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon?
        - Okay, and Farrah you said it was a microscope. can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon?
        - Or something that you would need to use to look really closely.
        - Lunar Orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits it in a large polar crater.
        - The oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water, but what's something else that they can be used for?
        - Yeah, so um in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, and basically look for these ice deposits, and since the water was so small, we then have to use a microscope to see it.
        - No, so no So what are they using the find the water?
        - A small machine will. what was the name of the small machine?
        - that's in the craters.
        - I see some nods yes. it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource. So we already know, sort of, the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource.
        - And it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic.
        - Okay, let me look at the reading. Okay, well, it says that they're really deep and they're really dark.
        - And the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water, so I know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay.
        - Okay, and what is inside of the creators Chris?
        - Ice is frozen water. And ice ice and water are the same thing, because they're both water. And from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really-what are they really?
        - Where does it say they found a lot of water? Let's look, look at that first paragraph. Does it say anything about finding a lot of water?
        - Because the water was really small.
        - start with the other colored highlighter. you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well.
        - That are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water. they have not found just lots of water in the moon. the moon is one of the driest places in the world.
        - So you're right,.we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering, maybe, if we take a look at paragraph two is, are there any other tools that the scientists were using?
        - Okay that sentence. So what did. What did NASA send to investigate.
        - Okay, that's fine. Let's look a little bit closer at the reading. So I'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph, not the paragraph. The, the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find. Okay.
        - Exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water, because if they find water, then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Yeah, so I so that the sentence that Jazmin is referring to is in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine Jazmin. Can you read us the rest of that sentence.
        - The textual evidence that says the scientists found water on the moon. And when you found that and underlined it
        - In the large polar crater. Remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the North Pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the Lunar orbiter works right.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole. and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater. these ice deposits are very small. scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - Oh, oh, so they had to, they had to send the lunar orbiter first to find it. And then they had to use the microscope to see it.
        - Why don't we look at it all together right now. Chris, can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter?
        - If you refer back to the text, and you think about what Chris added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water, but if you look at paragraph two, can you tell me what machine NASA sent to discover the water?
        - Why don't we look at the reading Chris. Let's look at the reading together. Okay.
        - I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs.
        - Right. You're absolutely right. We just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers.
        - Um, yeah, I think, like, okay, you could use it or okay well you could breathe it. Um, and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel.
        - And perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon 
        - Oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so, even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it.
        - Water and moon by, but you can only look at in the human eye, so we just go look at your day I we weren't able to see it and.
        - The goal is to pro right so similar to my um NASA with the microscope when they have the microscope It means that they're looking at something very specific right.
        - yeah yeah it's hydrogen, then the always oxygen because when I I went to NASA and I saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment.
        - And now, what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen.
        - You do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what I was looking at the words all around microscope.
        - Did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is.
        - Water can be valuable. Yes, we do have some Olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel.
        - Part two Okay, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - I have to read too because I don't know what we use it for. So we could do it together. So paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Astronauts could breathe the oxygen. And oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel. Do you guys see that?
        - Thank you, wonderful so you guys read about scientists and the moon, and can anyone tell me what did they discover?
        - And think of what different kinds of tools. He uses
        - Water
        - I thought tiny teeny tiny water.
        - But a small machine. Can you be more specific.
        - Okay, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth. The water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense Okay, I think I can do that.
        - Yes, that is correct. And that is in the second paragraph, NASA did send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters. But when you reach the third paragraph, you'll see that small machine they used
        - So you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first. After that, on the astronauts to use the microscope, just see it.
        - So that's the next step. So we want to find it. First, we can look at it until we discover it or find it. 
        - Or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water. 
        - So if you go back into the text.
        - About what those small machine is called. Do you remember what the small machine was called
        - Well, they were using it to see because the water were these, I think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye, so they had to see it in the microscope, because it was so small.
        - yeah they did I remember reading that as well does anybody remember what it was called 
        - awesome so this small machine was called the Lunar orbiter        - Jazmin, what did NASA do with that machine?
        - that word means that the water is small and you cannot just directly see it,
        - Because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things.
        - So now what I want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon.
        - We can be able to find water there 
        - When you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice.
        - yeah that makes a lot of.
        - Based on what you just read what do you think about the, what is the point of the microscope.
        - However, Luis, do you see in the paragraph, where it talks about the machine that they sent
        - If you put those two together, you can infer or guess from that, that ice deposits is where the water was stored. 
        - to breathe
        - So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?
        - Do you, if you look back into our texts called water on the moon,
        -  So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there.
        - yeah I think it said he investigated, and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater.
        - Oh okay these ice has a very small So what did we think what did we.
        - Okay yeah yeah yeah I have an idea.
        - Oh, I did it? That was the right answer. I did it.
        - yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope?
        - They said it lands at the South Pole and looks for ice to pass it, and a large polar crater.
        - So there's still people controlling it it's just from earth, so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do.
        - So maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water.
        - If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater.
        - Investigate ice deposits
        - They're like big on the kind of hard to describe. But it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground. I don't know. They're hard to describe.
        - Yeah, say, Farrah said that she found her answer in paragraph two. Oliver, What do you have to say.
        - But it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely.
        - Oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways.
        - Yeah, it was able to explore or the craters around it, then the moon.
        - Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So does that make sense in that
        - No, I don't remember.
        - So the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny. And if you remember in the reading, we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon, but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it.
        - They do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph. The difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use. And then microscopic is the, um,
        - And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper
        - Discover means to find something right. Okay, good. So what are we going to do. We're going to go back to the passage and we are going to look for the Oliverice or the equipment.
        - Water. So by using the Lunar Orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores. What was holding the water
        - i'm like the North Pole.
        - So let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        - So the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon, and they use that by starting with the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence.
        - The story is that when when the satellite went up there, they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume Do you know what a plume is.
        - Oh so.
        - That's what I said for my answer.
        - Wow. And do we know what craters are
        - Well, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024
        - Yes, you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have Like the oxygen like we breathe in the air, they don't have that on the moon
        - So that's a very good question. And what I'm going to ask you is, have you considered to look back a little bit further before the microscope.
        - But that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on, so I think you bring up a great point Chris, that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon.
        - called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - So that's the type of equipment isn't it.
        - So the Lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles, but the water particles are microscopic they're really, really tiny, so the scientist has to use the microscope as well, to be able to see them.
        - I think it means really, really small.
        - Does anyone want to like talk about how that could be very useful and valuable maybe yeah yeah I can.
        - the equipment to find the water. They might have been on the space station, or something that was also in space, but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work.
        - Yeah, absolutely. If you look back. Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?
        - I know. So now let's look back in paragraph two, what does it say that they sent to investigate the water
        - Says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. So you would need to use a microscope to see the water
        - Okay, the next sentence says
        - So they use both. So they use the Lunar Orbiter to look for the ice deposits in the craters, and that's where they could find The water.
        - I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye.
        - In the article, if you could go back and look, when they used the microscope, they get and use the microscope to find the water. The microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small. 
        - Oh umso like they're both the answer.
        - But the small machine did it without having to send people out there.
        - And I also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage So when I want you guys all to do individually, I want you guys to look at the passage the moon, is a desert.
        -  What was the name of the small machine.
        - Maybe it was through the thing about the questions, the scientists used the microscope or to discover water or observing the water left out. Do you think of which one to
        - Very good. So the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it. So it was really small. There's a small amount of it. So the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely.
        - They do, but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on?
        - And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it all goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects.
        - Drinking water is important, right, do we need that to survive.
        - So let's look back in the text. So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there.
        - So I want you to think of what a scientist does throughout all of the processes.
        - Well, I mean, I see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. But I guess I didn't, I didn't. It doesn't look like they found water in there.
        - I'm so sorry I'm unfortunately we have to go to the next group and have to end this session, but thank you so much.
        - Um, I wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon. What exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon. Okay.
        - It is it's all so you're onto something, but what does microscopic mean.
        - Oh, but it says that water is broken down into two parts.
        - Because it's in our passage. So let's look back and see if we can find it. So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So what is the name of that machine called?
        - So, in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um.
        - It's, it's the same thing. It's just that ice is frozen water. And I guess I just, I wanted to ask, I think I'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong.
        - Do you remember why NASA sent a small machine and maybe what it's called.
        - What is it about water.
        - huh yeah definitely So do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that, from the passage.
        - Yes, very good, why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen.
        - yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard, maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that Chris was talking about, so it sounds like they might need another tool instead.
        - Oh, so they have to find the first
        - And then we're looking for what?
        - Okay, so who can tell me about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - I didn't even realize that was that was the same thing, like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope.
        - Wait um so teacher, I didn't I didn't write the microscope or the Lunar orbiter in mine so.
        - And does anyone remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter does
        -  Let's get even a little more basic there. So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?
        - So when we look at the second sentence, we can see ice deposits. Does anyone know what ice deposits are?
        - Yeah, so I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - What do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Wonderful. Alright, so we have three different many paragraphs at the top. Can I please have someone be volunteer.
        - Does it say it in the text?
        - All right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen. 
        - and now we also can keep looking at the reading. If we look in paragraph three
        - Do you, do you see the name I'm looking through the paragraph.
        - Oliver, can you kind of explain        - it seems like there's two parts, Do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the Lunar orbiter and the microscope. Can you explain to the class, you know how those two work together?
        - Now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it. But the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky. 
        - Yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw Mr. Anderson use one and like, was he was looking at, I think it was like, I think he was looking at his spit or something. It was like, something like that. We were looking at, like, really close.
        - yeah it looks into craters. Why do you think we call it an orbiter?
        - That's how they found the water Chris.
        - So in the second paragraph. If you look at the heading on. It's called water is a valuable resource.
        - Oh great, and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like I don't know anything about the ice crater so I need you to explain it to me oh.
        - Does anyone know why they might be different? Luis's on the right track, but does anyone know why they might be different? Look at the reading. I want you to look at the reading, I want you to think why they might be different, it might help you.
        - yeah cuz, I think, with what you said, with the part Jazmin read it says NASA NASA scientists war machine.
        - Yeah. I got to explain more. I got to see more.
        - And I also wonder if some equipment is used for some jobs in space and some different equipment is used for different jobs, so I wonder if looking for water on the moon requires some different different equipment than some of the things that you're talking about.
        - Eventually for like fuel for this spaceship. 
        - And sometimes they the text is saying that. In the third paragraph, the water they found is microscopic so
        - Okay well um paragraph two, it says there's a small machine.
        - Well, how can you find something if you can't see it.
        - um yeah yeah that's like super super small
        - The astronaut and like the spaceship.
        - Okay. Did anybody see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph.
        - I can, I can look.
        - Oh, oh i'm not so sure no I don't think I don't think it told us in the story.
        - Okay, so I know that astronauts can't breathe and space. So they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff.
        - But not everyone else has that but what everyone else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again.
        - investigate.
        - And I don't want you to answer it now, I want you to take a second to look through the text again, but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it.
        - So when we picture craters. We just picture like giant things 
        - Okay, so I said something different, I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Oh yeah I thought that I can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm I just I just looked at the clock.
        - So what was that small machine called.
        - Okay um so what you said is that um.
        - is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters,  that's what paragraph told us.
        - I mean yeah cuz you know everybody needs to breathe. That's, that's, that's, like, the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing.
        - And in the text it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. Can you show me where it says that in the text. Can you point to it.
        - um well, it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice.
        - Water is heavy. So taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon, it would be a lot of weight. And it would take up a lot of space, right?
        - Okay, well, do you think you could tell me what the microscope does?
        - This lunar module again just like Jazmin said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters. This would help them find water.
        - fit as a water as ice.
        - I wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water, right?
        -  and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon So where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place, yes hairs.
        - Yeah, it doesn't say that. But if we read between the lines that I'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope. What do you think that might mean
        - They don't have to worry about bringing that water and so they could just drink the water on the moon, and they can stay hydrated. 
        - Oh, I'm really sorry I we have to go. But I just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers, instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong, that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us.
        - Okay. Okay, so paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - It's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there. And then, and then use a microscope to like study it.
        - Did they discover. Well. It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, um,
        - Exactly, and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope.
        - So let's read number one again. It says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. So based off of that, where do we think the water is being found?
        - Good job. So what did the lunar orbiter do Jazmin.
        - Who was doing the discovery in the question.
        - Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits. Ice deposits in a large polar--
        - Let me see i'll call the Lunar orbiter.
        - Was there a spot in the text, talking about what Oliverice things to find the water on the moon?
        - Um, yeah, I guess. So I guess. So I guess I just like I kind of know all this stuff, you know,
        - It then says water is heavy. So when you're if you are going up into space, would you want to carry all these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon. 
        - Something on the moon.
        - It also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn all of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon.
        - Can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot?
        - And what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft?
        - Great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted.
        - NASA send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment, since we're talking about the equipment they use, but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah Jazmin
        - So they so let's talk as a group. So they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon. Right.
        - Well, actually I'm still a little confused about the first part.
        - Different objects. And then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it. Yes. So, Farrah
        - Right and ice is water correct just frozen.
        - Okay so ice and water. Is that the same thing. Yes Farrah.
        - that's a great idea what type of equipment, do you think they would need to look at water.
        - yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom.
        - So when we look at the very first sentence, it says water on the moon would be valuable.
        - Okay, so, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. You know the name of that machine they sent?
        - Is there a difference between you would need and.
        - Yeah, that's it. That's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water.
        - Right, so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water.
        - yeah yeah that makes sense.
        - Is being used to ISIS and different form of water. It's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters, which helps them find water. 
        -  So if you keep reading that sentence, why did NASA send that to the moon, what about it, what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why.
        - Mm-hmm. But before, before you look at the water closely, how did NASA say that they found they could find the water on the moon?
        - They hope to one day in the future. But so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it. So that's one reason it's it's really valuable that
        - When I looked at it I sadi it investigated because it's small machine. That's what discovered it because it was investigating. 
        - yeah absolutely they had to use.
        - Oh wow, yeah. Yeah, that'd be man. I think so. Cool.
        - The thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like Okay, so if there was an astronaut on food, maybe they use that, but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut, because they sent the small sheet.
        - Oh yeah, um, I will, I will answer. Yeah, a lunar orbiter.
        - That that was my answer. I said that you need a microscope to see, I'm not true. Um, yeah, but our answer was wrong.
        - Right, the microscope. So the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what
        - mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was.
        - Oh well, I guess it's a machine.
        - I don't think I saw that part.
        - So the lunar orbiter is finding what?
        - Okay you're using this.
        - yeah so Jazmin, why was the small machine so important in this example?
        - and now, what about you Luis did you, you know learn anything new from this paragraph, I know you love space, but you know.
        -  right it's too small, so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it 
        - Can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually, it could be valuable. Does that make sense Oliver?
        - And how it helps scientists, maybe
        - lunar orbiter.
        - teacher, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water.
        - So what are we using the microscope in this reading? what are they using the microscope for in this reading?
        - Well, I know the answer. Cuz, cuz you just told me it is but um
        -  but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small.
        - Exactly. And why can't you see it with your eyes?
        - Okay, what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text.
        - I'm on the thing that I'm like Jazmin said, or maybe that you said are Chris your set. I don't know. Um, I think that that's probably the equipment. The thing that they said
        - i'm to discover water on the moon.
        - Can you explain to us, or is the function of the microscope.
        - If we're looking at paragraph.
        -  So, if that's where the water was, what did they use to find the ice deposits? Can anyone tell me? Can anyone refer to the text?
        - awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon.
        - So what. So, for example, right now, okay, say there's no there's no water on the moon, right?
        - Why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon.
        - Yes, that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right, so the water they found is super tiny, and if they want to see it, they would need to look really close with a microscope right.
        - Well, we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate. So let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph.
        - Correct. So we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question, because we have found it. Yes, Farrah?
        - But first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon. And so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon. 
        - You use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes.
        - Going to look back at your text is it on your tablets.
        - Oh great can you guys raise your hand if any of you have used a microscope dub Chris Jazmin or Luis.
        - um I was sorry I I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now, but I just wanted to say, I really appreciated, how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together.
        - I'd like you to reread paragraph two, and see if you pair up together, Chris Jazmin to see if you can find any better information about the tool that scientists scientists use to discover water in the craters
        - I don't know. 
        - yeah so that's a really good addition Thank you yeah I see that in paragraph three, it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water.
        - At the bottom of the crater just that little bit, whereas the Lunar orbiter was sent to the moon, to look at it all and investigate everything does that make sense.
        - So NASA sent a small machine, why did they send the machine?
        - And the water.
        - So they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon. Right?
        - Good good and Harry, can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water.
        - You fuel, do you guys know what that is.
        - These small the small machine can anybody find the name of the small machine?
        - yeah right, so what type of other equipment, do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water.
        - To find them.
        - You need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope, because you can only see it with the microscope, not the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah. So even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater, but the ice deposits are little
        - Okay, so I have a question will you read number two, for me, please. The second paragraph.
        - He was looking for microscopes.
        - So when I say go you guys are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself, look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon
        - A little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they.
        - Water is H two o
        - Lunar orbiter. 
        - Also says the word valuable. So now what I want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question. Do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource.
        - And I think when we hear the word NASA we our minds automatically are like Oh, we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what I think of at least I think of an astronaut.
        - Us to look at small stuff.
        - Microscopic
        - The other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water?
        - In my, in my revised response. Yeah.
        - But guess what the moon does not have
        - What do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for?
        - that's a really cool insight and I really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our group, but my question is, is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what Oliverice they used to find the water on the moon.
        - In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water, first, to use a microscope to look at the water, so you actually need the Lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon.
        -  Oh, I remember it's in these craters these craters.
        - What did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you.
        - And then, do you remember what the other
        - Okay. Do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent, Farrah?
        - Not on the moon surface, how do you guys imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does anyone know that Farrah.
        - So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that.
        - Yet, so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of.
        - Well, they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that.
        - And what about water on the moon. What's going on with this water.
        - Let's look back Oliveron, let's look what was the question. Say the question for me again, Oliveron.
        - Like it means to like find something or like, yeah, like to find something or to see something or to study something
        - All these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable, which means that people can live there for humans like us.
        - Oh yeah yeah we use them in science class.
        - In the polar craters. That was my answer. Yeah.
        - Correct. They had to use something else to find it before they could use or identify the water with a microscope, because it was such a small amount of water.
        - That's right. Lunar means something dealing with the moon. And so what would an orbiter be? What does orbit orbit mean?
        - yeah that's a great clarifying question I was a little unclear as well, but from what I understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon, and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used
        - Okay. One was used for to find the water. Any other thing was used for something different. Right. Which which one is the right one.
        - They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water.
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely.
        - And what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable? 
        - It can you say that again you're talking kind of fast.
        - That's right. So they use a machine a tool, similar to the microscope, like you guys said to discuss to investigate and discover, and that was called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know, like how.
        - And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water. See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon. Yeah. Chris.
        - Oh yeah yeah it's just water, so I guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water.
        - A microscope. So Jazmin, they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water. And in order to see the water, they would need to use a microscope. So how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article?
        - Second sentence that is correct. Right, so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now.
        - But what happened first is NASA sent the machine, so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon, to look for the water.
        - Remember the name of it, no.
        - Exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah Farrah do you have something to add.
        - And you are exactly right. They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called
        - Um, okay. Let me look again
        - Oh, okay. So even though they didn't use it on the moon. It was like, they still had to use it like later.
        - And what do you use them for in science class.
        - And those are tools right 
        - um, and what the question was asked before, and it is right because I
        - um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable.
        - Um, I can answer, well basically in paragraph two it says NASA send to small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - So when we look at, paragraph two,
        - And then they took the microscope that Farrah found in the text and used that to look at the water. Oliver.
        - so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but
        - That scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
        -  That explanation makes sense, but they're just describing the water um, but I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go.
        - Oh, because the ice is so small.
        - Um, I mean, that's what the story is about them going to the moon.
        - Um, I guess it could be a couple like it could be any size because depending on like how how big it is, like, it could be bigger or it could be small.
        - Yeah, Farrah, she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it.
        - Well, let's look at our texts and figure it out together. So in paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - Yeah, and what are ice deposits?
        - Um, do you mean for the, the three paragraphs or in one paragraph.
        - Let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water, especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water.
        - The ice deposits in the moon were very small right, so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say? Can someone actually answer this for me in the text, when we were reading it um What did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon?
        - So yeah it's got all the Lunar thing in it um but I shouldn't even be in this group I know all about space.
        - Oh yeah, that's a good description too
        - That you can't see the water without a microscope.
        - The water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters.
        - Right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean? Now that they found water on the moon, what can happen up there?
        - Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate. So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something. What did they use to investigate?
        - Lots of time and money.
        - can anybody share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead Oliver.
        - Okay, so Luis would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do.
        - Could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text, maybe, and
        - tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in.
        - right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it.
        - Alright, and Oliver I see you circled the same as well, so we can address both of you, together here, so can Farrah, can you tell me what does a microscope do.
        - Obviously, one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes.
        - So they use a not use a little.
        - No
        - It does, it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again.
        - Okay. Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?
        - Well, it's the same thing that Chris said, right?
        - it's full of these craters that have the water in them right, but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right, 
        - Oh, oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter.
        - Well, so if we refer back to the text I do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water, but before they get a microscope. They use some sort of other equipment.
        - Do what Farrah.
        - Absolutely, I think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration, but I think that, from the text we can make an inference that says First they go with the Lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes.
        - So I think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the Moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water. Yes. Chris.
        - But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source. So why is it a valid valuable. So resource. What does it say
        - And my answer came from the second paragraph.
        - Well, or we could all, so we could all look for what tool NASA uses to help discover. Okay. Go ahead, Farrah.
        - whoa whoa Okay, it sounds like it's not really how I pictured it may be.
        - So a microscope is a tool that does what.
        - I'm interested in the microscope.
        - Really small.
        - Yeah. And what is one thing that you know about space that can help us.
        - Great job. Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water.
        - For example, why do you think that they you a microscope.
        - Oh yeah I could do that Okay, so it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - It investigated.
        - It's like finding something
        - Okay. You want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now.
        - Um, I don't know, like, like ice. I guess.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, I got so
        - The fourth sentence. Can you look down at the four sentence.
        - Exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for.
        - What specifically did it investigate? Use your evidence from the text.
        - So you have to use all those details. So about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water. 
        - lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off.
        - That is true. Also, because in the passage. It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel.
        - In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then.
        - amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together.
        - They sent
        - You know why they have to use a microscope, so do you. Why do they need a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, very good. So, which one would that be the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope.
        - You're talking about. I remember that it wasn't actually a lot. So I'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded Like it sounded like there was it very much. Why is there enough water for astronauts.
        - And the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome. I think that's really interesting. Don't you guys
        - Nope, because we've got a lot more of it.
        - Right, so what we know that the ice deposits are very, very tiny, so I lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right.
        - Okay, so let's look in our text for a minute.
        - A scientific tool.
        - Air
        - um they found really, really tiny pieces of ice.
        - can you tell us now that you just read that sentence again what was the name of that machine.
        - yeah definitely they have to use all those things right, why do you guys think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space.
        - But do you know-        - like Farrah said the microscope, do you know why they use a microscope from the text?
        - Okay, and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of Oliver.
        - Paragraph two NASA sent to be small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - It says it in the text. If we go back and look
        - Okay, gotcha. Um, well, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately. But before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and
        - Jazmin you said masters kind of small machine, could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called.
        - Well, I thought, who was the answer to the question about, about what they use to discover the water. I guess I'm not quite sure why.
        - So my question was, can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does? So I want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two
        - Well I guess you know what it is. Is it water.
        - Do you? Yeah, okay. Let the rear end of that paragraph, it talks about what kind of small tool, scientific tool that they would use.
        - A small machine can you you know what that small machine called?
        - yeah Thank you that's great So here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could anyone tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph? So what is this function?
        - yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water, like you have to think about ice or like gases, you know it give me a little bit tricky so
        - In the story,
        - Right. So would you be able to see it with your regular eye? Would you be able to look down at it?
        - Okay well.
        - A moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water. 
        - Yes, okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close.
        - We could use that. Have they split that water and they use that hydrogen oxygen for rocket fuel and that's how they could get to the moon and they can leave from the moon, right. So that's another reason why water could be such a valuable commodity. 
        - I see. But what was, what was this water like, was it like like a cup of water.
        - It means really small.
        - Paragraph two all right, can you tell me what it is.
        - yeah I saw lunar orbiter.
        - So, what did you guys see in your mind when I read that? Jazmin?
        - Maybe even what what are they investigating, if you think back to the question, what are they investigating what was that tool used for.
        - When we discover when you discover what are you actually doing.
        - Correct. Now, did it say the craters where full of water or was the water below the crater?
        - What is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text.
        - Three.
        - What does it say Luis about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - You know, they found water in the moon, you know, they found it in the craters and that's great. I want you to ask yourself what equipment, did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon. Oliver?
        - In a large polar crater. Okay. So you were right. It's in a small machine, but specifically the small machine was caled, what
        - The water is actually very heavy so
        - Okay. All right. Well, let's look at page, paragraph three, okay? Do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it. Can everybody take their finger and put it on number three, find the number three, paragraph 1, 2, 3
        - yeah can you remind me what that was called.
        - For an organized sport, you're probably going to need a jersey right to play.
        - Can you find any in the text.
        - So Jazmin Maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for, I think it was in the maybe the second paragraph.
        - I read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024
        - Wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it, then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount.
        - can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called
        - Right right a desert is really dry, so if we're saying the moon, is a desert, what are we saying there's not a lot of there?
        -  So can you tell me what is it, what is in the microscope for
        - Okay, let's look back at the text, real quick.
        - Space and all that, what do we need for oxygen takes.
        - Well, let's focus on the text.
        - They did find craters of water on the moon. And that's kind of why they went up to space. They wanted to see if there were water in these craters. They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters.
        - We do. Right. So if the water is already there. The astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or Storing as much on their spacecraft. They'll happen. They'll know it's there.
        - Oh wow, okay.
        - Right, so I think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon. Yes Jazmin.
        - For other things. So they breathe the oxygen. And then the hydro Jen can actually be used for rocket fuel. So they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things.
        - Okay, we read through it. But, um, I have a question if that's okay.
        - all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as Oliver. so. In reading that you also found that the small machine was called what?
        - Scientists have found of
        - Lunar Orbitre
        - Perfect, now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon.
        - Oh, OK. I got it.
        - yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south Pole and looks for ice deposits and then, if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope.
        - Okay, so to review what you were saying they use the Lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water.
        - So a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon.
        - And where did you find that out in the passage
        - They could breathe it
        -  Today I would like for all of you to look back at paragraph number two. And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine.
        - Um okay um well, I guess, they had to use some some equipment um like um.
        - And then we've got that lunar orbiter as another piece of equipment, what do you think that they were using that lunar orbiter for.
        - i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay.
        - Have you ever used a microscope Farrah.
        - Oh, well, yeah, I think the same reason like cuz they said it in the in the reading. They were like, You have to. Yeah. Like Farrah said you have to use like a microscope to see them microscopic particles
        - As I'm going back and looking in, and it says that the water they found is microscopic which means you you can't see it with your naked eye. So you would need exactly what Farrah and Oliver said, you would need a microscope to look really closely to see it.
        - Oh yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's really cool that that's a possibility.
        - Yeah, so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water, but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water. 
        - Okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated.
        - I guess I wouldn't be that hard, I mean I could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the Lunar orbiter.
        - Exactly. We have to find it and then study it, Oliver, what do you want to add
        - Well, I guess it's true observe
        - All the actually says very clear in the second paragraph, can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as NASA sent the small machine and what is that called Jazmin.
        - Yeah, we had a chance to look at and have the conversation.
        - Great, so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there.
        - It said you need. So you'd a contraction for you would need
        - So actually in the text it says the water, because we know that are looking for water is really, really, really, really, really small so they can't just look at it, they need equipment to help them find it.
        - So in this text, we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon, why do you guys think they needed to use equipment, why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands? Go ahead Oliver.
        - A.
        - So I want everyone to look at paragraph five, and see how else we can use The water on the moon.
        - Oh OK, so my answer was right, I just said that, basically, there was too much water.
        - So what do we think Chris microscopic means
        - looking deeper into it. Right. 
        - Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know. It's the Lunar Orbiter.
        - I guess I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - And if we actually take take a, take a look back at the text, you can actually see that
        - Uh, I don't know where. The water they found on the moon, I guess.
        - Water. Right. But the question is, how do we find the water. So what was used. What are the scientists used to find the water
        - Well, I guess it talks about
        - yeah so, which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and NASA can be valuable to us.
        - that's a fantastic question and that's why there's another tool that had to be used in order to find it
        - So um Jazmin, can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two?
        - On your so well, I said the same thing I said about the microscope and I guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on.
        - Oh, it says, oxygen, and it could also be used as rocket fuel.
        - I thought it was equipment and discovering water.
        - How can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right, because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for all these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time, so we have to look at the text.
        -  So see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future. 
        - But the way it's written in paragraph two, they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water, then they use a microscope.
        - So if you look back in the text and paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - And what is ice.
        - So can anybody find in the text where it mentions um discovering.
        - Where it mentions discovering.
        - Okay, so did the scientists use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?
        - They um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer
        - I thought that, that's why I thought my answer was right, because in paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic so that means that they found the water and, and then they talk about the microscope in the next sentence.
        - Did anyone catch what it was called?
        - Um, I'm not sure.
        - Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it. 
        - Okay so they found  this equipment to discover water on the moon.
        - It says water on the moon valuable are very important resource.
        - That sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then, as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air, you know circling the moon.
        - If you go back to the microscope that Farrah was talking about, how did they find water using the microscope?
        - What did they do with the water that they found on the moon? I don't know, maybe they drank it.
        - But on the line as conveyed in that passage, we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope. So, good job there. That's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters.
        - you do need a microscope to find the part, the particles of water that they found  Because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it. 
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?
        - Can someone identify the name of that small machine.
        - orbit to discover the water that is already on the load and you would use a like semana and Oliver said you would use a microscope to look at the sample the water that you found on the moon, if that makes sense.
        - So, um, yeah, it's it's speaking to me since I think, but I'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it?
        - They're very small. Oh ice ice deposits are frozen water.
        - Yeah, I wasn't thinking about that, I was just looking for the word water. And I didn't even think about the fact that, Oh, yeah, like you said today, and ice and water is the same.
        - Oh yeah that's where I found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay.
        - yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then, how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that Jazmin found in the text.
        - Right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water
        - Oh, I think there's two pieces of equipment.
        - Well, I said that thing about them not being able to drink it. So I think I'm right too. 
        - And what it's investigating is what Luis shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit, what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits.
        - That is a great point so off the bat guys, we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource.
        - What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily.
        - But did it talk about scientists, going to the moon?
        - On. Yeah, I was. I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water. So I have both of those. So I don't know why my answers wrong.
        - So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence.
        - Water in those craters which is really exciting, because when I was your age, we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere. I'm curious Chris, do you remember any actual equipment that they use. Do you remember how they found the water in those craters.
        - How they found the water.
        - Oh, oh, okay, okay. 
        - So we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs, right? So you you caught that first in paragraph two, but if you kept reading in paragraph three, you would have seen the real word for the small machine, right?
        - Yeah, it was just or big
        - And you need a microscope to see the water
        - Oh, the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Okay, yes. There are a lot of uses for water.
        - Did you guys watch the movie about how the Lunar orbiter worked.
        - I noticed that too. And that's why I oh I looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water
        - yeah that's awesome so if we think about what we already know from the text we've got this thing called a lunar orbiter.
        - So we would need a microscope.
        - Yes, a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so Harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water, we can see that but can someone describe how the water
        - It's really small.
        - look really closely at what?
        - And then, paragraph three, this is where Farrah got her answer. 
        - So Vana. Can you point out any equipment used
        - In the texts that are going to talk about equipment. So first of all, we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what Jazmin.
        - Very good, and which word in that sentence sentence tells us that they actually find the water
        - Well, I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but I just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text on such a such a deep level like
        - Oh, like so tiny. You can't even see it.
        - Um, it's a center.
        - Okay, so Jazmin just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate. I want everyone to go back to Part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water. go ahead.
        - Is there a lot of it.
        - You mean the lunar orbiter, it's how they discovered the water
        - It doesn't mean that we use the tool named the microscope to find it, but the water we find is very microscopic, which means it is very limited and tiny.
        - Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely. What do you think that they need to look things really closely.
        - Okay, is there a name of the specific machine there that you found Jazmin.
        - That they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry. It's kind of like a desert. 
        - We need to drink water. And I feel like if the astronauts were on the moon, and they get thirsty, then they do want to be able to have some water to drink, right?
        - Yeah, so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So those ice deposits are made out of water. They had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it.
        - And then on paragraph threee, it says that they found the water that they found was microscopic meaning it was super small that they had to use a microscope to use it to look at it.
        - Is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it. So from that scene. It's are we going to look at large bodies of water.
        - But the microscope was used for something different. The small machine. The lunar orbiter was used to find the water. So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used
        - Well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of.
        - To investigate.
        - So that's what actually found the small little water so that I can and I found that information from the second sentence. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater.
        - On a spaceship. Would that increase the value of water on the moon. If they brought it with them.
        - It doesn't have oxygen.
        - Absolutely, they're small. So, you know, you think about water on Earth. We look at ponds, lakes, oceans, we can see that water. We all need a microscope. That's going to make tiny objects appear large
        - Okay, so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs. So paragraphs one and two, you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine.
        - Yes. Okay. So it says the Lunar Orbiter. It's a small machine to investigate. Now investigate means to?
        - I guess not. So the craters aren't full at all.
        - yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer.
        - What did the lunar orbiter do
        - Let me check Okay, it says NASA send a small machine called.
        - that's I mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you, you need to use to find something that is very small.
        - So even if you're looking straight to it, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not. So they needed an equipment that would help them. One second, Farrah. I'll be right back with you. They needed an equipment to look very, very close to that little block of ice, and then they would see if there is water in there. Farrah, you want to share something with us?
        - On a spaceship.
        - Farrah could you tell us what that something else is? It's in paragraph five.
        - And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon. So we know that they're kind of the subject. They're kind of who this article was talking about, right.
        - Macroscopic. Is it going to be very heavy
        - Does anyone want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic.
        - To be honest, i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article, to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something.
        - Well, I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - The Lunar Orbiter consent by you remind me what why the lunar rover is so important.
        - What is NASA specifically sending in paragraph to.
        - yeah okay that makes so much sense.
        - Can anyone tell us what this orbiter Did?  someone we haven't heard from yet.
        - know that could help us a lot right.
        - Oh, the water?
        - So if you're investigating something you're finding something. So what are you going to find about it. Once you find it, what else? What else you're going to want to know about it.
        - So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment.
        - Right, so they they hypothesized, but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume, then we can send our we can send.
        - Like that the microscope. Um, I guess that it's something that like you would use to study something up close.
        - Can't really bring that water with them. They could, but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon. 
        - Yes, that's an excellent point I think here in the text, what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay.
        - When you guys read this article, what did you guys think was the most interesting parts of it?
        - Yeah, I know. That's one. It's the lunar orbiter Jazmin. Come on.
        - Yes. So ice is just a different form of war, it's just water in a different form, it's frozen solid.
        - Let's look back in the text. So once we have
        - That I love that question and then what it does, that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment, but they use it to.
        - It seems really cool.
        - While there is some water there. It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water.
        - Okay, let's look at paragraph two, 
        - OK you can stop you can stop now. Okay, so the first sentence that you read was NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - I just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for.
        - That you said you know that it's a small machine, they said, but can you tell me anything more about it, like what did you find interesting about it, maybe the name of the machine.
        - Microscopic us. And where was the microscopic us at
        - Yes, so they are using a microscope. But what is the microscope helping scientists do.
        - Well, the rockets, the hydrogen will break up into-        - it breaks down, and it's able to make rocket fuel, which help the spacecrafts move. And like in the story, it's like the cars. You know how you put gas in a car?
        - Great job Thank you so I noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is.
        - Into the water right they want to look closely at it. And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a
        - Which is very helpful, do you guys remember reading that part.
        - However, I do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself.
        - Right and this paragraph, also tells you what a lunar orbiter does, can you tell me what the Lunar orbiter does.
        - Okay, now if you go back into the into the text. Do you see anywhere in there that talks about, you know, how it could be valuable.
        - Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope. But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small. And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it. 
        - Mike, their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into. Have you ever used the microscope before.
        - Yes, you could you could definitely say that they sent to lunar orbiter to investigate and what exactly why did they have to send the Lunar orbiter what what's the purpose of the Lunar orbiter and what what is it really besides, a small machine.
        - So what tool in here does it say they use to find it?
        - So the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice. 
        - yeah great and, what is this machine for?
        - So it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits, but they they go searching for it. Like, they're the thing that finds it right?
        - Can anybody tell me if they heard something in the two sentences we just read that sounds like it might answer the question, what equipment was used?
        - Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller. So it's very hard to see. In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope. Yes, yes.
        - Chris that sounds like a little bit of your answer, what do you guys think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon?
        - So can you        - before they found the water, what did they use to find it?
        - yeah so I remember when I was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel to.
        - Yeah, definitely. They use all that stuff, but specifically here in the text, where do we, where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters.
        - where it talks about what tools they use to find the water
        - Oh, I know that's one s H two o
        - And it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here, you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is.
        - So when they discover water on the moon. What happened next. What is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters?
        - Did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it, maybe they would have to use a microscope.
        - um so I guess, I was just picking.
        - Okay, so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer.
        - Look at the third paragraph.
        - So scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it, but
        - You're correct four glasses of water is that a lot of water on the moon.
        - detectives right and so detected they look for things right, and so that's pretty much what the what NASA wanted to do they wanted to send this small.
        - Right, exactly. So do you think the microscope to help them. Look for water while they're physically on the moon.
        - Okay--
        - So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope.
        - Everyone can review it in front of them. And then when you're ready, raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph.
        - If you look in paragraph to
        - Well, I know what craters are because I actually went to NASA.
        - yeah and what does the machine call.
        - What does that mean that the water is microscopic
        - How's the lunar orbiter able to do that. Well, um, they they taught it how to fly and it flew to the moon.
        - RER: Look for it?
        - So it can deeper deepen your understanding about space.
        - Well, you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it, you can see bacteria and cells. 
        - I guess I didn't really, that makes sense. I didn't really read it closely enough because I think I hear what you're saying.
        - The microscope and the lunar orbiter?
        - And, and so, when I reading paragraph two, it says that they sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate. But we also know that later in paragraph three, paragraph three, it says that, where is it, the water they found was microscopic.
        - The lunar orbiter now does anyone have an idea what the Lunar orbiter is.
        - Oh well. Hmm. If you have that machine and you have a microscope. Are you guys thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small.
        - To do what Chris.
        - Jazmin that right that's me okay sorry I couldn't really see your name tag um so I was wondering, so I remember you were talking about how NASA send a small machine Do you remember what the machines name was.
        - Yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater. Chris, what do you want to say?
        - Right, so they found it deep. That means that, so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters, they found it really far down
        - Perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph, in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important Can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon.
        - So, they, they, the scientists, they go into the moon and they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters.
        - That answer.
        - So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water
        - Okay, I I did say that it could be split into two parts, hydrogen oxygen.
        - uh huh.
        - And microscopes to investigate the small tight, the smallest or I'm sorry, the water that was found this tiny
        - yeah and that's how this little machine, the small machine works right?
        - but are they like the grand Canyon like deep holes in the ground. What do you think they look like?
        - and so, with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to Farrah what they need oxygen tanks on the moon.
        - you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three.
        - I you know my dad took me to NASA. And when we were there. We saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff.
        - You might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource 
        - I guess I didn't really read it like I kind of knew the answer. So I just kind of didn't read the text.
        - I'm okay. I'm gonna have to look again.
        - Which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5% water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play.
        - That was in that was in lunar craters. I think someone mentioned that great piece of information.
        - Can you read that.
        - cool that that's exactly the two pieces of equipment that they mentioned in the article So what does the Lunar orbiter do.
        - Right. And what is it called,
        - Me.
        - Okay um in the text, what did they What were they using the microscope for?
        - yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering I I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Did what did it say valuable meant
        - So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two
        - Oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab.
        - Good so i'm going to add that, to my visualization I know NASA which Chris knows so much about.
        - Well, they, they have to find it first. So they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope. They use it once they find it.
        - So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us. Thank you.
        - But if we look at the the information that was actually provided. Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon. So everyone look look at it together. And the first statement that it says there.
        - And that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry, excuse me, does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon.
        - If you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer.
        - What is the actual name of the small machine.
        - Yes. Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water
        - um i think it's in there, um let me look, ok um
        - It lands at the moon South Pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - To breathe exactly, and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does anybody know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us.
        - Okay let me see.
        - yeah so it's a, it is a hole off the ground, it's kind of elevated.
        - But there are some uses that we could use water for in the future, even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen. Yes, Oliver.
        - Okay, let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading.
        - Yeah. So what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two,
        - Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things. 
        - I know they're deep their dark they have ice in them.
        - Yeah, so they use the microscope has any have, have any of you guys ever use a microscope before,
        - Because it's about trying to find water on the moon. 
        - Let's look at paragraph number two, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - And then it goes on in paragraph three, to talk about how you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon. Because remember, they didn't know if we had any, and then they found it.
        - So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues. They didn't talk to anyone on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues. And what did they find with the lunar orbiter 
        - Perfect. Okay, so I want to start by us all looking over at question, paragraph two, okay. So let's look at paragraph two in our passage.
        - I want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and, if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you I would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time.
        - Um, so you're right, they do use microscopes to look really closely. So can you elaborate on why they use the microscope? What did they do using the microscope?
        - So this tool. It was mentioned in the text, and I want to see it. Does anyone remember what was said in the text about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - but can you remember how that small machine was called?
        - Because the moon is is really dry. It's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon. So
        - Did they go up there with their oxygen tanks and a microscope to see if it was on there. That's not what it says.
        - Yeah, so they don't have to carry it. You know, because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it.
        - Yes. So, okay. I was just wondering, as we were reading it through like because I know we're in this group for for help. Like, I was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong.
        - Well mean I think any place that there's water would be good, because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff.
        - What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope. Was there any other equipment that they've talked about
        - Absolutely. I think that that would be a more valuable deduction. If they already had it or put more on the moon, good job there. Jazmin.
        - Exactly. Now while I'm reading this, I see a lot of words that maybe I do, maybe I do not quite understand. In a moment after our answer Farrahs question I'd like us to go through and identify some of these words, Farrah, what's your question?
        - Like out loud or just on my own.
        - Chris, what did those scientists fine, could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter.
        - They could drink the water
        - Um, what about in the first paragraph there? Do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it?
        - Okay, it says.
        - But lately, especially NASA has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment, like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines, the Lunar orbiters Jazmin that you helped us find.
        - yeah Chris that's exactly right, so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission, but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome, thank you for sharing that with me Chris, that was a great job let's see Farrah.
        - Right. So if you look in the text. This is it. They use the lunar orbiter right
        - When I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - I realized that based on what they're saying, the small machine, I think was the thing that I think this small machine is what found that water.
        - And then there's a microscopic amount of water, super, super, super, super small. So again, great. Like, what Farrah their first answer using the microscope. 
        - And it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume, and this is where your points Farrah comes in.
        - I want everybody to think, and then you're going to get a chance to vote: is it a microscope that found the water on the moon, or is it the Lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon.
        - the creatives are not full of water, it was a little bit of water in the craters on the moon, that the Lunar orbit does that
        - It's something you use to look at really small thing.
        - The Lunar Orbiter landing at the moon South Pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon.
        - And what does it say about water can be split into
        - Let me just kind of build off that. So by you saying they don't have to carry water. What does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there.
        - and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small. so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found. Oliver.
        - Is this about like how there's no astronauts.
        - That was what was used, so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like Farrah said they used a microscope. But when we go back and read the text. It was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water. Yes. Chris.
        - They send these machines, like you said, Jazmin NASA send a small machine which is called the Lunar Orbiter to Earth. 
        - That's the thing I said. I said that one. 
        - Frozen-        - frozen water. Yeah, frozen water.
        - yeah that's a great answer, thank you, so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the Lunar orbiter 
        -  but on what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out loud.
        - Well, they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from Earth.
        - Oh, I know there's, I know there's, I know there's, I know this.
        - um well I just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the key words to answer the question.
        - Teacher : Awesome. So let's read. Number three, so that we can kind of make an understanding of this. So that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth.
        - I think, but I think Chris has his hand up. Should you call on him first?
        - Yet it's called the Lunar Orbiter and it looks for ice deposit in the polar craters.
        - I read it it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - In our story. It talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said, and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it Without looking through that microscope.
        - Oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me. Yeah.
        - take a closer look back at the text and it says in the second paragraph NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate so thinking about that, I think that Jazmin might be correct that the who would be NASA at least from reading through that sentence.
        - You're going to want to know what it is. Okay. So yes, Farrah?
        - A small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences Chris, what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was.
        - Just do the initial discovery or initial I guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal, and what.
        -  And, well, it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water, because you can't see it without the microscope.
        - Yeah. After that, they have to. They have to make an observation. Right. And how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can, they, they will need to observe this water.
        - Well, so I think the main idea of the story is that
        - Oh, oh okay I just saw the time it's time for us to go to lunch.
        -  Water!
        - I believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter
        - Um, they use microscopes, because that was that was in my answer. And I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Provides support for students to understand the text (e.g., rereads text with purpose)
        - Oh, kind of the same thing, isn't it.
        - Oh, so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope.
        - Okay, yes. I'm sorry. It is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water. I'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see. 
        - Jazmin was talking about that machine that looked in the craters.
        - like, maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments.
        - but helping reading the text and finding the evidence within the text can help you learn specific answers to the question like what specific equipment was used and how the scientists use that equipment to find water on the moon.
        - that's exactly right so an inference is when we use the clues that the text is giving us.
        - To investigate ice
        - Alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read. Who could give me a quick summary of the text? two to three sentences.
        - Yeah, actually. Okay. That does mean a lot of sense.
        - Look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Okay. And then what they did was, in the third paragraph, they talked about the microscope. 
        - So they have been there right so they have been there and they have found evidence of water.
        - Absolutely they did use that to get to the moon, didn't they? But really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well.
        - It says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah.
        - So,
        - No, I guess not.
        - uh huh and so, if we're looking at polar craters on the moon, where are they going to be located.
        - Has anybody heard those words before.
        - So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts?
        - Exactly. And so we know the word microscopic means what
        - And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Whoo. Does anybody know what that machine is called
        - and as Jazmin pointed out, it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits, where the water was, right. and then it also talks about, later in the text, the microscope.
        - Could you maybe look at that piece of equipment too just so I know that you can find an answer in a text.
        -  that's really cool and I would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - Yeah, awesome, isn't it, what do you use my microscopes for. Do you know. Does anyone know, raise your hand.
        - Okay, and the end of the article says that.
        - Oh, so they like.
        - Do you remember what the name of that small machine was
        - So even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert. It feels like a desert. So when you think of like the feeling of the moon. Think of that. That's something that can help you remember this information.
        - Alright, so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article.
        - Well, it didn't really say. It just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you know, I went to NASA. So I know that I just use a lot of equipment like
        - It was, it was called the lunar orbiter.
        - Okay. Does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph?
        - Yeah okay so
        - So it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic, it's so little and such a small amount.
        - Right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon, that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon, but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right.
        - but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text.
        - So if we go back and we look in the passage, the first paragraph is called the moon is a desert.
        - Oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter, is that the answer?
        - Oh, well, let's look at the first paragraph. If you could read that for me.
        - So I would like you to do Chris is go back to the text.
        - Yes, perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for.
        - So it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water.
        - is there, something else is, is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money, in particular, that you see in the art in paragraph six.
        - Hmm. So I the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water. However, it does say that
        - Yes, it's the lunar orbiter.
        - So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here.
        - So let's see if we can find the answer in our story. So let's look back and see what we can find.
        - Or discovering something on the moon.
        - It was the Lunar orbiter.
        - But here in this paragraph, they just name one, so what is the one equipment, if you look at the first sentence
        - And then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet 
        - A lunar orbiter. What are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words ,but what what is the Lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean? Luis.
        - So they can be found. Did it say that it was there.
        - And the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water. So even when they got there with the Lunar Orbiter. They might have had to use a microscope, because there's such small amounts of water.
        - hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice, because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her Jazmin's question, yes, there.
        - Okay, so you said they could use it for rocket fuel. But what other thing didn't say right there that you just read.
        - Yeah, I got one. I got one.
        - Totally because if if you ever get a question which might happen again and other classes or places you a question. And there's a text there. The text is probably very important
        - And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small. So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, Jazmin?
        - Okay, and what equipment from the article that you read and the Luis just read and in paragraph two, what did the article, what did the scientists use to find water on the moon
        - The ice. It's a form of the microscopic ice
        - There you go, and is breathing important
        - Can you reread paragraph two, for me, and see if you can find any other answers.
        - But that wasn't exactly what it was about.
        - You know Teacher. I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits.
        - And that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water, even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon. 
        - Um, okay. So lunar orbiter.
        - Oh yeah I do.
        - Can you be a little more specific. What, what was the machine called, what they do.
        - We can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it, you wouldn't be able to see it. So definitely what Farrah said yes. Jazmin.
        -  So those are things we all have our own opinions, but those are things that you can prove to be true.
        - Okay, so if you can go  back and let's look at paragraph number two, it specifically talks about the exact equipment that the scientist used to investigate and find the water on the moon. So can you reread paragraph two, and see if you can find a little bit more information there that will answer the question a little better?
        - Because the article does say a little bit more about what that small machine actually is there's a name for it so.
        - Because that's where I found my answer it's in Part two
        - I just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon, so there was a very small amount.
        - Bob, what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in
        - It says that this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. 
        - So yes, that they're in these big craters. The large polar craters, but the so the ice deposits are in the creators. So
        - Okay, so did it say that they used a microscope.
        - So if you go back to the passage, you know, discover is to look for. 
        - So the moon is so the water that they found. I'm sorry, the water is microscopic so it's tiny. And they even explain to us, it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it. So what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small.
        - Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if everyone will look back at the second paragraph.
        - Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter 
        - Exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand Chris what's going on.
        - What else does it say the oxygen and hydrogen could be used as?
        - Yeah, yeah. That's why I said that that the equipment was the microscope.
        - and then Chris. Did you go back and look through your textbook. I asked you to
        - yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right, but in order to find the location, with the water, what are we using.
        - So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see.
        - Correct. Now, does everyone see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water
        - And microscope and what is the microscope.
        - Very good, very good. I'm glad you're seeing it. So let's take a look back, Oliver noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us. So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,
        - Who don't want an orbiter. What did it say that we did with it.
        - So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter.
        - NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - So let's look back at the text. So you've all read this once through, right?
        - So I see first. The second part, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - So although they did use a microscope to look at
        - That you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe, help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water.
        - Go back and, the second paragraph says NASA send a small machine. Well, which is what Jazmin read. But if you were to keep reading that sentence, it would tell you what the small machine was called that they sent to investigate. They sent a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - Yeah, I just found the name. Um, and so I added I added the rest of that sentence to my answer. So now my answer says, NASA sent a small machine cutter Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Whoever finds it first can raise their hand and read back to me the exact words in that first point, the talks about scientists mining water on the moon, and we'll see if we agree with Chris.
        - yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands, how many of you have used a microscope before.
        - Yeah. And what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water. 
        - yeah the microscope.
        - enough amount of water to subside people for a long time, right, because waters really heavy. And it's hard. You know, it takes up space on the spaceships. So do you think it
        - Okay, so from the article what equipment did, did the scientists use to discover water.
        - You're finding. But in order to find it. What must you do
        - We can look at the text and we can look for clues
        - So we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon, when the microscope is used to dis-
        - Um, like Jazmin's answer the small machine.
        - look back to the reading
        - Right, yeah. Yeah, ice and water. It's the same thing, right.
        - So do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water, they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it. The text says if you look straight at it, we wouldn't be able to see it.
        - It's helping them see it, when they study it.
        - Right. So is there any water on the moon?
        - Well, I mean the thing Jazmin was talking about sounded pretty good.
        - Okay, not just a microscope. What is the actual equipment called
        - It was a small machine. I'm sure that they didn't use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like Luis said, but there was that one little piece in the text that gave the specific name of the tool. And that's what
        - There's a word in the sentence. Can you can you go back to that sentence for me the sentence that talked about the Lunar Orbiter. Look at that sentence for me.Is another word in that sentence that helps us to know that we actually are discovering something. So what do you have to do to discover
        - So did you hear the beginning of what you said there was a specific name of a little tool that they used to investigate in water.
        - but an excellent place to look is in our text. 
        - Yeah. And do you remember what the lunar orbiter did?
        - Help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes, where the microscope, because that's an equip up piece of equipment.
        - To find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text.
        - Teacher : Is the water on the moon, big or small.
        - So we were talking and I was saying, oh,
        - Thank you for reading um yeah so you're right, so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so you're right, it is a small machine, but what is the tool, called the specific tool used.
        - See how it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate? Jazmin, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be?
        - Can you go back in the text and fine what that small machine is called?
        - Yeah, yeah definitely. Okay, so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence: this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater. So what do you think is this ice deposits refer to? Oliver.
        - um yeah that says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - First of all, let's think about these texts. Okay. And let's think about the main ideas of these texts. Okay. So can you tell me where are the main idea of this text.
        - So what it's really having us do here Oliver is it's having us infer that they use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon, so I can see why you are confused, but am I helping you clear this up at all, but the Lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon.
        - and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water, you or I would drink in a day, so you know actually I like the spirit, you know you tried to answer the question, but unfortunately.
        - yeah, I think, so I actually don't know I think it's possible that the Lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it, and then it was all done with robots but that's a great question. 
        - Well, they use an orbiter. And then let's keep reading, paragraph three, in the last sentence that says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly
        - Is says water is heavy.
        - So in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon, so we found that.
        - things on the moon right, specifically the ice deposits.
        - Now Can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does, can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you guys raise your hand and when you guys could share with the group. Go ahead, Farrah.
        - Did the did the NASA astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon, on its own?
        - yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the Lunar orbiter and, if you look inside the word lunar where do you see.
        - and there's more details that we can add to our answer to show that we understand the text Chris your hand was up thank you for waiting.
        - ice ice is also water.
        - so referring back to your texts. 
        - Well, they needed it to breathe.
        - Yes, and then What else does the Lunar orbiter do.
        - Right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided Jazmin.
        - that's right that's right and now, so why does that, why does building new equipment How does that tie together to time and money.
        - Well, and it's also what does it say what does it say about the weight of water.
        - The small machine as you recognized is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon. Good job. Jazmin.
        - And what did it and what wasn't looking for, Anybody remember that one?
        - Okay, so it was the lunar orbiter so is that what I got wrong is that didn't say the lunar orbiter?
        - They use the microscope. But before they could use the microscope. What did they use to get to the moon. 
        - And that is true, they did. And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-        - and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon.
        - Well yeah like I think that the thing that they did was they had to use like spacesuits and stuff like so I didn't really even read it, I just kind of knew that, like they had to use that stuff, you know, they had to use like space suits and stuff.
        - Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text. What equipment did they use?
        - Yes, they did. Doesn't. Can anyone go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called? 
        - That's correct, because if you look at the name Lunar Orbiter and look at what each of those words mean. Lunar refers to what? Do you know?
        - What if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at NASA figured out that there is water on the moon, which is super exciting What would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents, based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery. 
        - Come, I'm so sorry. But, um, it's, it's actually time for us to go now. But before. Before we go, I wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers. 
        - Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water.
        - Based on what you read, could you maybe tell me how they found the water, what did they use to find the water.
        - What does it investigate?
        - um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right?
        - I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass.
        - You know what, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - We found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers.
        - um well, I think the name I heard was.
        - that's a really good point.
        - The potential uses of water? Was that exciting? or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon?
        - It investigates.
        - that's right they don't and and so, since they don't know what would they have to do to be able to get it out.
        - Oh well, so I guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see.
        - Okay, and we have to use the microscope to look at it. 
        - Oh yeah we all use them in science class.
        - All right, everybody, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Um, well actually it was more of a question.
        - awesome so Jazmin, can you tell me what the small machine was called?
        - Lunar Orbiter. And the second piece of equipment was called what
        - yeah I was looking for the word water I forgot I didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the Lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, and paragraphs three and four. Let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though.
        - Oh, I know um can I go, can I go.
        - You see in the text.
        - The small machine that Jazmin said.
        - Jazmin remind me what investigating means again.
        - And what are the ice deposits?
        - yeah and what was the purpose of that machine, so we had a small machine, it was called the Lunar orbiter What did it do what was the purpose of it?
        - Okay, awesome. So in our text it says that it is in small amounts
        - Excuse me
        - But if we look, does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon, or that the water is kind of buried underneath.
        - That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the.
        - Let's stop for a second. And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?
        - And what form so so, is it like.
        -  and they so we're looking for something with NASA right or scientists right, where it says scientists use or NASA used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are NASA right.
        - Oh OK, so the water they found is microscopic so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay so yeah they use that I guess choose so that is also evidence of the text that we can use to answer this question um.
        - Okay. The Lunar Orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do
        - Okay, so let's look at both pieces of equipment. So the was the microscope. Did it help find the water on the moon.
        - Thanks. Thanks a lot. Hey, I'm
        - That can be used to help look at small little things, and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes.
        - Right, so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship. 
        - In this context, it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool, or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering.
        - That's good. There wasn't anything mentioned about equipment you want to move on to the next quote
        - It's to look really closely at really small things.
        - To find right so if we're looking to find something. What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something.
        - I want you to think of how, what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon.
        - Okay, you can put your hands down Thank you just tracking it's Okay, if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon, yes Chris oh.
        - Orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like I guess, like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon.
        - Yep, so you, you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right. It wasn't used to discover the actual water.
        - Wow, that's a great connection Chris, because we are talking about scientists, but there's also many other occupations and jobs that people do were like doctors who use microscopes.
        - Um, okay. So I saw it in paragraph three, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So I'm not totally sure like why my answers not right.
        - Yes, in this story that we read
        - Oh yeah up I got this one I bought this one, we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun, because we go around it.
        - Uh huh, yeah.
        - Right, so how did they use a microscope to find the water
        - All right, there you go. That's, that's okay. You can stop there. So what did they send it to the moon to search for the spots.
        - Okay, so it looks. If we look back on our reading. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - And see what equipment we use before the microscope. We know that we have to use oxygen in space. And so, specifically in paragraph two, we have NASA sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen, but a different tool 
        - I mean, they use oxygen tanks when they were on the moon.
        - Let's read it together real quick. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Oh yeah, they called it the Lunar Orbiter. That's great. Thank you.
        - It's not actually on the moon. It's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water.
        - yeah well I definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is.
        - Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The small machine is called a lunar orbiter.
        - Now let's move on to the last quote
        - i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters.
        - It was the lunar orbiter.
        - yeah and then it was confusing at first, because, as you said, it is a small machine.
        - Do you did you see any textual evidence in the first quote that says anything about equipment.
        - yeah I I bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right.
        - We have to think about the equipment that is used to discover water on the moon. That is true. They do use a lot of equipment.
        - So take a look at the second paragraph, read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again.
        - Farrah. So I really liked your response. You said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. And do you remember what we were looking really closely at?
        - All right, let's get back to what Chris was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because, on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft. 
        - You see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable.
        -  Oh well, yeah in science class, we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it.
        - Can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first. Then, what, what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to
        - Now ice, what is ice I guess.
        - yeah we have them in the science lab oh.
        - Yeah, there's, um, let's see. Yeah. And the very first sentence right there.
        - Oh, my gosh yes you're absolutely right so.
        - to discover water on the moon scientist used blank can you remember what the scientists use on the moon.
        - We did read that. It's called a Moon, lunar orbiter.
        - Okay 
        - What was the machine called
        - yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon, to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer Jazmin do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text, see if you can find some evidence.
        - yeah well actually I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So if we keep going into paragraph five, it says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. Now we have to
        - yeah awesome and that's awesome knowledge and thank you for sharing that with us. Um just to redirect us bit back to the to the text, and to the topic um.
        - Like Why were they using a microscope to look at the water? What were they were hoping to find?
        - But there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water, but it wasn't what was discovering the water. 
        - So based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters.
        - Is that the robot that searched on the planet, can you read that whole section again for me.
        - We cannot live without oxygen. What's another I really, I'm really glad you found that. What's another thing in that paragraph that you could use.
        - Very important. So that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource. We can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel.  So that would also take some weight off your spacecraft. If you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it all the way up into space.
        - So I think that's in paragraph two,
        - Okay, so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable.
        - Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two,
        - So the way I looked at it was NASA send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water. And I think the piece of using the microscope was for if I traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself, I would have to check under the microscope
        - Yes. And what much Nate rocket fuel for here on the main
        - Oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so.
        - and find two examples of equipment news done the moon, and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful, after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you guys need any more time.
        - Yeah, yeah. My mom always makes me carry the groceries inside and my arms are always like, hurting so much
        - Yeah. So how did they find those ice deposits
        - Okay, this will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - For you, you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article.
        - Thank you Luis so Farrah I haven't heard your voice in a while Farrah does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used?
        - Very good, very good. So they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely, they would need the microscope.
        - and um and I i'm curious if any of you guys um can pinpoint that a little more closer in the text okay so.
        - Oh yeah, I see that NASA sent  small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits and
        - before they found that water What were they what tools, were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground.
        - So, um, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately. But before we go, I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to
        - yeah that's a really great detail, you found so Chris based off of that evidence, are we swimming and large bodies of water, what are we looking for.
        - Awesome, and why do you think it looks for ice deposits? What would the ice deposits tell us?
        - that's a really good question to ask and that's something that I think all of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading, so if the water is not ready yet, is it not valuable.
        - Yeah a lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, that's what polar craters mean. Polar means the poles, the North and the South. So what is the main idea of this section. What is, for informational texts, what is the main idea. What is the target they they want you to know.
        - Can I answer.
        - It's like really, really small.
        - Okay, that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together. But what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic.  And that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that. So if you can look at, paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon.
        - Yes, you're right right, so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know, maybe you guys have used microscopes in your class before.
        - All right, well, if you look at the story, you see in the second paragraph, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. That would be considered another piece of equipment that NASA used. 
        - Right right right yeah yeah I heard you talking about that was so valuable for yeah, thank you for reminding me.
        - It talks about that. No, excuse me, paragraph to
        - Ok, well why do you think they were going there to look for water?
        - Yeah, that makes sense that makes sense. Okay, so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all.
        - yeah great and so I saw that as well, what Luis do you think that, according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen.
        - So yes, just like if you can't breathe oxygen, you're going to need an oxygen tank.
        - Yes. Great. So, you know, wish and use a microscope to look closely on the water right but we can find the water first, and then, then we can look at the water closer later. 
        - And Oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight.
        - hydrogen and oxygen.
        - What tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon.
        - So basically just what I was gonna say was, I wasn't sure why my answer was, well,
        - yeah definitely so Jazmin now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on.
        - cool so that's kind of, what do we think class? that's kind of the first step. So there seems like there's two steps to this right? there's first the investigation period with the Lunar orbiter and.
        - So then that that is also true NASA send a small machine. We go back into the text, it is called a lunar orbiter.
        - and see the exact name like if anybody can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water, how you talk over it for about two minutes.
        - Do you know what a polar crater is
        - Good and that was the outcome right, we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon, which is really fascinating.
        - I don't understand why my answer's wrong. 
        - Well, what is what is, what is the section to say, paragraph two,
        - So I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that. And I guess I was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well?
        - Oh awesome he found it in part three.
        - Now were there any others are those the only two that you could find I stopped after paragraph three, but if I keep.
        - Mmm hmm. Okay, I was kind of spacing out for a second there. Um, what you say def
        - Or did they mention anything more about equipment.
        - Yes. And so from the passage Oliver. What do you need to see the water
        - Can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe
        - And the answer, you'll find is in the text.
        - Right um so yeah NASA they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine, maybe um.
        - What are we learning from this paragraph.
        - Right, so we know as people on earth we have to have water to live. And so if they have water on the moon.
        - So in the text explains the lunar orbiter does something. Can you tell me what it does.
        - And that means the moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Um, I don't know.
        - And it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely. So all of those tools that they've used helped discover that.
        - Okay. They use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water
        - It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax. I'm going to help you read it. Okay, NASA send a small machine. So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you
        - A small machine washing machine with that machine called.
        - Ah, OK so lunar orbiter do we think that might be the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Oh ok ok ok I see that now. Oh wow, okay. I don't. Sorry to interrupt our class, but I just realized it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water.
        - Okay, good so um, can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter?
        - Good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon.
        - Well, that's why I thought that maybe my answer was the right one. Because, um, cuz the the Lunar Orbiter, I think, that they sent to investigate. Um, I think maybe.
        - Right. But this passage was only talking about
        - As a stage to go further into the solar system like Mars. So they're going to need fuel, they're going to need oxygen, they're going to need hydrogen. And you're absolutely right.
        - So if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water
        - i'm gonna look at really, really small bits of water.
        - let's let's take a step back Luis What did you get what What did you get from this article what what did this article tell you, especially you know you're our in house space expert.
        - Okay, so the part that I'm going direct us to is
        - um yeah because well um because the water it's so small.
        - It landed on the moon South Pole. That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits. So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters. I guess it was really cold the
        - And we learned a bit about how this is a really big endeavor so there wasn't just one piece of equipment that scientists use there's actually many pieces of equipment and tools.
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - Okay, so here's my question. I'm, I'm trying to understand, like, why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water
        - Oh well, um a desert it's really dry.
        - What can you tell me about the machine that NASA sent to the moon? The lunar orbiter. 
        - and see what you can find, see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started.
        - mm hmm absolutely. So how do we, have you ever used the microscope before.
        - Do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts.
        - Okay, so i'm noticing Farrah that you are looking to, you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really, really small, and that is absolutely right. 
        - So although, your answer was correct, that we do need to drink water, the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship. 
        - yeah So what do we think is the function of the Lunar orbiter in this paragraph.
        - Um, well, let's see, uh,
        - Okay, so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope.
        - yeah I remember.
        - Because Lunar Orbiter means orbiting, flying around the moon. And so they have a small machine.
        - In the sentence Farrah read, are the scientists, what are they using the microscope for?
        - So in the texts in front of you called The Moon is a Desert
        - Well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah Jazmin you can.
        - Um so me and Farrah um we had the same answer, and it was the microscope.
        - right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water.
        - So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water.
        - Oh, we already had the evidence of water.
        - Students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different
        - Yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope?
        - Okay, I found out to. It's a lunar orbiter. But it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph.
        - I know that there are two words that
        - It look and looks for ice deposits.
        - Excuse me, Mr. Lawrence?
        - Thank you Jazmin for reading from the text. So now we have two ideas on the table: that it was a microscope or this small machine. What is the small machine called? let's give it a name. Um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine? Luis you have a hand up.
        - really, really, really small, so we do need a special tool and that special tool.
        - yeah so they didn't just use one thing they used.
        - Or like, What state was this water found in?
        - Mister A, my answer came from paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - The ice deposits are very small.
        - yeah awesome so I guess what i'm wondering is, if you have to use the microscope and you, you have that already have something available to put on those slides.
        - yeah you do really great job, so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the Lunar orbiter fine.
        - Let's see what paragraph three says, Uh, maybe we can discuss the difference
        - And Jazmin. Why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon.
        - Can you read it to the to our group so we're we're on the same page.
        - Oh, so they wanted to find the water, which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice.
        - Oh so that helps you find the water or really small water.
        - It's like, I think it's like a big hole like on the moon.
        - I offer one
        - the third part of the article. OK, and they used that in a specific line which Farrah noticed, when they set the water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a microscope.
        - But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them all there we've got this whole elaborate backstory. Right. What makes it very interesting to read
        - On the crators and I think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there.
        - Okay, a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Um, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits. So is the lunar orbiter the right answer.
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used?
        - Okay. And like you said everybody told me that were the key word was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says NASA send a small machine called a lunar Order, order to investigate. So does that make sense where we got that from
        - yeah great response, they use a microscope to look at the small small specks of water exactly have you ever used a microscope before.
        - is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day.
        - Where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft. Having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things, which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response.
        -  What is the other main idea that we can learn
        - No, because it's just frozen water.
        - I want someone else to answer this. Do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance?
        - So if we look back in our text. Maybe someone can read from the text. If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon.
        - Yes , ice deposits are frozen water. And so they use that equipment to what?
        - helmets to go into space and then scientists, a lot of scientists, they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves.
        - And and kind of back to Space and you know we're not. We're not leaving. They are being able to inhabit the moon right now.
        - Um okay, so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye. You have to see it through the microscope.
        - Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment.
        - Luis, do you know why they call it an orbiter?
        - So where that fits into our reading if scientists, so we sent the machine into onto the moon, we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter.
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely.
        - See um well I do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but.
        - Yeah, so that's like something that you use to find or do you use, like if you need something. They have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean I use it to discover. And so I said that it's the small machine.
        - What did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon?
        - If an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us, but they didn't send the astronauts. They sent a machine.
        - So the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic
        - Okay, so if we look back to our reading. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter. Does anyone remember why they sent the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So we're going to look back and we're going to see if we can find it in the text. All right. 
        - that's a good notice you just said so, even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section, we can only assume what they tell us, but let's keep that in mind, just in case they mention it later yes.
        - and then do you remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter what it was doing
        - Once scientists are on the moon. They use more equipment even more to make more discoveries
        - Um, I just wanted to say. Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. But before we go to our next class. I just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with. Thank you so much.
        - Oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you guys remember reading the article, the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen. what does that make?
        - yeah, we can see in the third paragraph to see the eyes is very small, so we need the microscope to look at it.
        - Well, I I had a different answer and maybe will help Farrah so I said that NASA sent a small machine and so and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - For example, Farrah, do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope, but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon. Does that make sense?
        - The oxygen just it's in, it's in here. It's in your text and about paragraph five,
        - So you could always write that to that, even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small, they still can't see.
        - Well, it was a microscope. That was my answer.
        - That was used to discover water on the moon, and I want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was Hughes to discover water on the moon.
        - yeah, what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater?
        - Well, no, it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter.
        - And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there, however, that small machine was still necessary because that's what found The ice deposits. 
        - It was in the form of ice. You know, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - Okay, well, it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy I mean I already had that part in my answer.
        - Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second.
        - Um, well, it says that it landed on the moon, um, let me see what that means about finding water. I'm not sure.
        - So coming back to you Farrah so Jazmin helped you out, you pointed out this small machine. Do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem?
        - But let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope. So that is in Question or paragraph number two, or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope 
        - What else did you learn about the moon from the article.
        - Does anyone know what the differences yeah go ahead Jazmin
        - Oh um maybe like after after the Lunar orbiter.
        -  Now when they discovered the water on the moon, did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny, tiny amounts of water?
        - So they use the Lord the Lunar Orbiter to to to
        - or can anyone else help us out, they did find these, They did find these craters right 
        - But I kind of agree with Jazmin and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine, helped them look into those craters. But then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found
        - I agree that is very difficult, but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope, how do we get the water? 
        - So the first thing that the scientists did was investigate, they needed to investigate the Moon before they could even go in and see anything else. 
        - Like is it. I mean, I guess it's to find the water to, like, you know what I mean like to go get the water
        - Oh yeah Okay, it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Luis Can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use?
        - Maybe they're studying it.
        - Is can you imagine
        - Oh yeah, I know this. I know this event. Um, it's the
        - Right now, I want you guys to take one second, just give her the text and fake. I want you guys to take a minute to skim through the text and to think about what you think the main idea of this text was
        - Good question. He said in the reading that paragraph three, that the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you will look straight at it. So you have to use a microscope want to see it.
        - Yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other. So once you've discovered it. Now you found it. And now you can look at it. So the microscope is what's looking at it 
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. There you go. That's our key word Jazmin. So a lunar orbiter to investigate. Can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does
        - NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - What do you think? How the Lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits?
        - So the water they found is microscopic so you would need the scientific tool.
        - Let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question 
        - So you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon.
        - Water on the moon can be valuable. I mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways. For example, future astronauts could drink this water. Yes. See, that's where I got my
        - Okay, so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water. Can someone tell me what that word was again? there was one word that described the water-how how much water there was. Yeah, Oliver. 
        - Where they're using the microscope again.
        - So what I wanted to add was just that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us.
        - Good job, Oliver. Good job. So what in that paragraph Farrah, what is that telling us about the microscope?
        - it's a machine.
        - Oh, so they like something like studied the water
        - The water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water.
        - I was microscopic
        - Yeah, so the question is what equipment that scientists do stuff discover water on the moon.
        - MUMBLING
        - mm hmm yeah so when we're thinking about what kinds of machines, they were using the right answers that they were using two different kinds of machines 
        - Right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not. So what do you think help the scientists.
        - Yeah, so that was definitely. It was a form of a microscope.
        - you'd need
        - You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome.
        - So let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it, and then they can use the microscope to see it. Why do they need to microscope again?
        - And the water molecules on the moon were really tiny Jazmin I saw your hand go up earlier, did you have something to add.
        - right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right, and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space.
        - Endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it.
        - yeah, this is a really good answer, so the machine is used to find where on the moon the water is. 
        - Yes, that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon.
        - Am I looking at stuff. Am I making it look really big, so I can really see it or am I zooming out. What am I doing?
        - And Luis now that we've heard from everybody we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon, is there any other.
        - I'm looking
        - yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned.
        - Why would you need a microscope according to that sentence, what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence.
        - The answer is located in a paragraph two, and it's not too difficult and because it says NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate right and.
        - Good. Yes. So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that. Can't wait. We can see that there's something in our glass.
        - At the water, that's right Farrah. So they already found the water when they use the microscope. So the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope. So if you have any questions about that.
        - because if you go on the read further. It could, you know, for example, what you like the text says you can drink the water, they could use the water
        - That is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really small.
        - We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you. And while I'm reading, we are looking for. Yes, Oliver.
        - Orbiter. I have a day. Yeah, that was my answer!
        - yeah I can do that Oh, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - How small was it. What did. What did. How was the water described in the passage
        - I'm the one that Luis read. I mean, the one that Chris read
        - so what kind of a.. how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope.
        - I think Oh, I said I know this Okay, it says it looks for ice deposits.
        - To look at the moon, they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so. But now that I'm reading the text just like Luis said I din't pick up on this before either.  It doesn't look like There was an astronaut.
        - There probably isn't enough in the drink on the moon. But what do you think they can do to get more water on to the moon.
        - So we're in the process to reread it
        - Right. Okay. So let's recap. Let's recap. So what are some benefits and valuable. Why is it valuable to have water.
        - So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful.
        - Okay. Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink.
        - Yes, very good the scientists. And what did they find? I think we all know, this one.
        - Right. So do you think based off of what you guys just told me that. Are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water.
        - I'm, I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. I hate to interrupt, but we have to run. But thank you so much for working with us. It was really fun to work with you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.
        - Yeah, in paragraph 3.
        - So we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one, the water, but the water on the moon specifically, right? So, in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters. Do we all remember reading that part?
        - It's not very much at all. Do you think that could fill up a crater.
        - At paragraphs three and four. Those are the ones I think we need to look at again.
        - So how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article.
        - Well, you're right. It does. It does. The lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon, but the ice deposits are very small. So they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water. They didn't use it to discover the water
        - It doesn't talk about the water. But before that, it talks about how they find evidence of the water right?
        - No, I guess not a lot, cuz it um yeah I guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see
        - So, in the very first paragraph. If you all look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence.
        - Um, yeah. So I agree with Farrah. And I thought, basically, that like, um, you know, you would need the microscope, because they said in the reading.
        - Yeah, so the small water. What else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon. You can think about things. Maybe you've used a microscope.
        - it's the same thing.
        - All right. Where did you see that
        - They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water Farrah.
        - yeah Oliver said it was in paragraph three, and I see Jazmin's in paragraph two.
        - So it is asking in the text field like back in the text. There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right
        - They they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the Lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon, making contact with that part of the moon.
        - Did they discover water with the microscope?
        - In the beginning that they use a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then.
        - No, that's, that's, um, that's not very much at all.
        - Yeah, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - And if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon. What does that tell you about the water
        - Yes, exactly Oliver awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what Luis talked about.
        - No. He just found a little water is that was what Chris found.
        - yeah that's what the microscopes for.
        - Very good, and how did they find it? We know that the water was microscopic, it was very small, but what what type of tool did they use to find it? Farrah mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water, but what what i'm what type of invention, it was it had a really cool name.
        - Next step, like so, after they after they find the water in the craters.
        - Right, so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there, and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right.
        - Um, you use it to look at the water
        - Well, I saw on you know Orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment. I saw like in the reading.
        - tiny yeah that's great so microscopic here means tiny. So what does this mean is that the water that we can find currently on the moon is really tiny it's really limited.
        - Because we might think it could be the microscope, because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered. 
        - You see, right, especially when you're in space when there is an oxygen. It's great. You could get the water right there, split it up and have oxygen to breathe.
        - A big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does.
        - You have full so that takes us to the understanding what does microscopic actually mean.
        - astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen. So that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right
        - Yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing.
        - They do use those and article even talks about using those different things.
        - However, if we take a look a sentence earlier, like the water they found is microscopic. So here, the word microscopic, could you please use another word to replace it? So what which word would you use, Farrah?
        - Right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water, because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the Lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the.
        - So the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do
        - If it's cold there?
        - Okay, so what is a small machine that they sent, What is that called?
        - I don't see that either. I think that um Chris, you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent
        - I'm so sorry. We have to go to lunch now. But before we did. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And specifically I wanted to thank you for being so patient
        - Let's underline very important.
        - So it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close. 
        - If we look at the microscope. More specifically, that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it, you would need to have already discovered it by this point, right. Does that make sense.
        - Well i'm just wondering, I mean I said the microscope so.
        - So what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon.
        -  okay yeah yeah yeah I understand that.
        - Because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does
        - You know, being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon, the natural resources, like the water that was recently found.
        - Yeah, I guess that's true because I read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water. If I did that.
        - So did the scientists, go to the moon.
        - Um, yeah, I can do it. this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. these ice deposits are very small.
        - let's look at number two. This lunar orbiter looks like for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Can you--
        - Okay, so with water. Now, in paragraph two, okay. Now, what is a different form of water. There's different forms of water. There's a frozen form, what is that called Oliver?
        - How
        - Maybe look in your text it says it in the.
        - yeah great the Lunar orbiter buying the eyes departed in Apollo crater right.
        - But my question coming after this would be what did they use this microscope for and anyone can answer this question, using the tax and using our discussion, what did the scientists use the microscope to do.
        - Right. That is correct. So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about. So
        - Oh yeah yeah we we use it in, in, and Miss Smith science class.
        - Very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah.
        - That's what it says in verse in section two.
        - Exactly, exactly. Now let's go back and look at that text. 
        - um yeah I don't think there's astronauts in the story so far.
        - About that small machine. What was that called
        -  NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater.
        - Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes. So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right
        - Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater. So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small. We can't see it with our naked eye. Do you know have you turned before naked eye. Yeah.
        - yeah well that's you know I think that's kind of like the bigger question here, I think the orbiter was part of the first step, they had the thought I wonder if there's water on the moon, they sent the orbiter to kind of you know.
        - So the moon doesn't have oxygen on it. 
        - So it's talking about the water in space.  And what a valuable resource it is. 
        - Ice is frozen water. So ice so ice and water on the same thing. They're both water just in different forms. So going back to what Jazmin said earlier, NASA a small machine called a lunar orbiter. That is a type of equipment. 
        - For this one, I mean I know what we use it for in science class.
        - It sounds like it sounds like the second one, but also but also I I went to NASA so I know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - If there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon. They'd have to bring their own water.
        - yeah that they both do sound pretty good and that's why we're talking about it so let's take a look at that sentence, again, the one that Jazmin read aloud. 
        - So you have to find the water before you can look at it right. Does anyone know what discover means?
        - But, based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text, so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question.
        - um I know they said, the thing about drinking it because I got that street from this text.
        - I use the microscope. And my answer. So I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Perfect so NASA send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon, 
        - Yeah. Do you know why they have to look at it so close?
        - Oh, rocket fuel rocket fuel.
        - Oh, oh, oh, so I just, this really
        - Which is very important, but the discussion question where you're trying to answer is the equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So look back in the text and you can kind of scan over it.
        - Right. What was that small machine name. Do you remember
        - so friends, what about other than just helping astronauts breathe, what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for?
        - Oliver said the microscope.
        - So I know that a lot of you guys did mention being able to use a microscope. So now, what's something where something that stands out in that sentence.
        - But to identify the water they use a microscope 
        - Oh, gotcha. Okay.
        - yeah we'll talk about that, like the microscope and stuff um I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - They used it to investigate.
        - Is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool.
        - Okay, so let's look back in the text. I see. Let's read it says let's reread the text quickly.
        - Oh um yeah I guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water.
        - So how much water did they find could use to find in the text, how much water they found.
        - Um the scientists
        - Do you know they were trying to find
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. A lunar orbiter.
        - yeah well um I guess it's implied here that the Lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits.
        - In paragraph three, it says, um, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Do you know what a microscope is
        - And so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to Jazmin 
        - Teacher : Right, so it's small, so it's saying. It's very small. And what does a microscope do
        - To investigate what?
        - it's looking for ice.
        - In order to see the water, you have to see. You have to use a microscope. Okay. Because they find this water, it has too tiny that we can, we have to use this micro me with this microscope. So that's a good point there.
        - Just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know, like you said, you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter. Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading
        - In the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts. They send that they just sent the Lunar Orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot. A robot doesn't need oxygen to survive.
        - Okay, so Are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry, are they telling us, we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small, we would need a microscope.
        - Okay. And that makes sense. They do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small, but to find the water itself. They didn't necessarily use the microscope, when they found the water, then the microscope came into play. So they can actually view it. Does that make sense.
        -  so let's listen why don't you jump in Chris is the would you say the moon is dry, or is the moon wet, what do you think.
        - Take it with them.
        - Okay, so let's go back to our text.
        - I'd like you to focus on just the microscopes, does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon.
        - Okay, it says NASA centers for machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - It says that water is heavy. You know, I also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon.
        - And let me look
        - Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right?
        - So do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read.
        - I think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts.
        - Like satellite flies in space. It was launched on a rocket from Earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room. So around the moon. So it's orbiting the moon.
        - hmm and do you remember, if there was anything from the article that i'm told us if the water was used is there anything else, that it can be used for.
        - That microscopes not on the moon.
        - That word could that's in the second sentence. Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways. 
        - You know what I think that's right dead and my research, I actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon.
        - So it's not a lot at all.
        - yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that.
        - Look for?
        - That's right. So, um, have you used a microscope in your other science classes.
        - Has anyone seen a microscope before.
        - Oh yeah, we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there.
        - Yeah, I think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope, but they they might find it with something else, with the machine.
        - Yeah, just see this tiny water.
        - Yes, a small machine. All right. And what was the name of that machine.
        - Okay, tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about
        - Right. Like, like, I remember. Okay.
        - Well, the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those.
        - Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer.
        - yeah that's awesome thanks Chris, I always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that, like we use our eyes to see everything around us, but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about.
        - Yeah, I'm talking about. So what do you think about that.
        - And Chris, I also really liked your response. But do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters.
        - Okay, so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look at this reading passage, does anybody know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions. What key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question.
        - Deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater
        - No. No, you need a microscope to look at it.
        - And find these little amount of water in there.
        - So the Lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the Lunar orbiter looks for that right.
        -  I wonder if you could, I wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two.
        - Yeah. And also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right
        - Yeah, it's like, um, it's like, um, you said already. It's like when you find something
        - Chris part of what you read said future astronauts could drink this water, so I think right now we're still in this like hypothetical state where we're thinking.
        - And what is a microscope.
        - Good point of the storywise, they were looking for ice deposits. But ice deposits are water. So that's the important part of the reading. 
        - Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which
        - ever used a microscope.
        - Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small 
        - Yeah, so it says. It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely. 
        - Is it small. Is it big. How are you picturing it
        - Interesting. Okay.
        - Well, water I guess. 
        - Yeah, in order to see it, you would need to but first they have, they have to find the sample to look at. So we're focusing on how they found the sample.
        - It lets them see the the tiny ice deposits.
        - Was my answer my answer was that the scientists, they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence?
        - Yes to investigate. So investigate means that we're kind of
        -  So then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens, there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome. 
        - that connects to something Luis said earlier, I think about the oxygen tanks, could you tell could Luis could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank.
        - Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?
        - Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon.
        - Right so there's more there's more to that What else does it say about the small machine.
        - So in the third one. It's talks about the water they found is microscopic.
        - So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called.
        - Mainly in, let's see, paragraph two
        - So we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning. Chris.
        - To breathe.
        - Now, if we look at the text where it talks about.
        - Yes, I love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine. Oliver.
        - yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do Jazmin what is the machine doing.
        - Exactly, it's divine something. So did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place. Do you think
        - Can I look back.
        - Then, all right, well, so let's move on. Um, so, Farrah, did you see, you said that you saw the microscope, and it was used to look really closely. So what did the microscope. Look really closely at
        - Right, so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere, right?
        - In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine.
        - All right, very good now. So the word machine is in that sentence right now. What we're looking for is the machine actually or the tool that was used to find the water. Now what tool is mentioned in that sentence.
        - And what did the machine do, what is used for?
        - ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of, even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is, we're kind of making some guesses right? So what do you think it's a small, we know it's a small machine and Chris, what else do we know about it now?
        - But how would you describe an ice crater if.
        - And you can you can you see the text, right now, Oliver do you look at the can everybody see the tax that i'm talking about.
        - Okay, small that works. Does the machine have a name?
        - You can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen.
        -  So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter.
        - So let's look back in the story and see if we can find those tools. So there's two tools.
        - OK, so the if you read on, in the second paragraph, it talks about how the craters were in  Deposits of ice.
        - Yes, that's amazing. So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small. Right.
        - So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it. So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage. Does that make sense?
        - So Chris, you may have gone to NASA but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying, because the question is specific to the passage.
        - [Rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself]
        - Yeah, it means so small. We actually can't see it, just looking at it, can we, so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it. 
        - On and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called.
        - Okay, let's see. Let's look at paragraph two, we see in paragraph two, there's a Senate's about how NASA send a small machine called a
        - yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong I love again how you use the, how you use the word microscope, um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example, when we use a microscope.
        - look for clues
        - Exactly, but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place.
        - OK. OK, that's really interesting. So why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on Mars-        - the moon, not Mars.
        - Yeah, that's really causing me see. Wow. So it was just a robot. And it was able to go around the moon and and find the water for them.
        - Chris: Find
        - Find water.
        - Let's go back to paragraph two, once more, it does say NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. What do you think the word investigate means
        - What they found on the moon. So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen.
        - now, Luis Farrah and Oliver to read paragraph two as well and see what extra equipment or what kinds of equipment could narrow this down.
        - And the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it, so the microscope help them to see the water better, but I did it help them find the water.
        - So in our first paragraph there, it says that you just read it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters or dark places where the sun never shine. 
        - So we know that the scientists used equipment, so now I want us to think about our responses, yet, but Jazmin.
        - Zoom in and see it. So they did use other pieces of equipment to help them, but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - yeah so in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so the microscope was a really good answer, but the microscope is just looking at the water.
        - I'll let me read it again.
        - The three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon. And I want everyone to be listening.
        - I think we know it's, um, well, it's an orbiter. So I guess that means like it goes around the moon.
        - No, no. So what did they send
        - How do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water.
        - Spaces valuable. You know, you need to save as much space as you can. And it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon.
        - That is kind of funny. So I'm Luis is right. It says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. Do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present
        - Okay, so keep going so you were reading, paragraph two, and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the Lunar orbiter is for.
        - Okay, so what so class. What would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text. Yes Jazmin. 
        - But what special machine did they use. It was in our reading
        - It said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits. 
        - So look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean. Or maybe just need some clarification, take just a moment, raise your hand when you find one.
        - is that a lot of water Chris.
        - Okay, so what I'm seeing is that in paragraph three, the second sentence starts out by saying
        - Okay, there's actually another piece of equipment in there.
        - Just the small machine. Can you specify what they called it though.
        - So if we look back at the question, what do you think the key words in the question are
        - yeah and so when we're talking about this specific article in what the scientists need to find water on the moon, it looks like we've got these two different components here the microscope because those water molecules are super duper tiny.
        - Equipment could be a machine a piece of technology, do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment.
        - Well, I can try it's kind of, I guess, but I guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces, maybe of the ice or.
        - Oh, oh, I'm sorry, teacher, I just heard the bell. That means that it's time
        - Yes, exactly, and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters 
        - They use the they use the small machine. The Lunar the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits. So ice is just dried up water.
        - You know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water, so I think they you know they both work together.
        - Alright, let's look at the third paragraph. So they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny. Right.
        - mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter. 
        - gotcha so um I I read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024.
        - Said  they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name.
        - Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first. And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it. Before we can look at it. 
        - Um, yeah, okay, um, scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth.
        - um well I guess so.
        - And so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon. That makes sense.
        - Instead of just the water at the bottom.
        - That is correct. And what's the small machine called
        - But if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four. That might change your answer. Just go back and reread number four. 
        - I circled the same thing with Farrah, so I guess I am right too.
        - It says that that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it, even if you're looking straight at it.
        - Exactly to investigate, investigate means what
        - For the kind of equipment that the scientists used
        - Good. Thank you for that. So let's look specifically at paragraph number two, both of them mentioned craters. Right. However, if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth, from what I see. 
        - RER: The microscope.
        - That is important, but what's the reason why they would want to break down what was the reason why they wanted to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. What could they use hydrogen and oxygen for
        - I guess that we're looking for water on the moon um.
        - Oh yeah it's the Lunar orbiter I forgot to put that in there.
        - We know that the water they found it was what
        - or anything that helps you find the water, so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw.
        - But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample. So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters. 
        - and then, what do you need to see the the water itself.
        - They're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said
        - In paragraph four, what does it talk about when regarding water?
        - Oh, text
        - Did they use any equipment.
        - Well, I was just gonna say I was looking at the clock out, it's time for the next group. Um, but I did want to say thank you so much Mr. Teacher for
        - Oh, oh, it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - So if we look back in the second paragraph, you're right. The small machine is called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - yeah like.
        - You know, we human beings breathe oxygen.
        - I'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen And you can drink the water.
        - Microscopic. So what does microscopic mean what does it tell us
        - No the one that starts with "NASA sent"
        - So going back to Farrah's question before. When you said, why is the microscope the wrong answer. Well the microscope is looking for something.
        - All right, so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert.
        - Great so what was that part of the text telling us.
        - Yes, I want you to skim the text and let me know which Equipment. In particular, they used to discover to make this discovery.
        - Okay that is moisture. But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon. We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that.
        - Yeah, okay. So I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also masks and suits.
        - So what does that tell you about the water on the moon.
        - And Jazmin did the machine which is called the Lunar orbiter, by the way, did that have a microscope on it.
        - Oh, oh yeah ice.
        - Yeah, I think, that doesn't make sense. So okay, so that's the answer. That's the equipment that you to find the what, like to discuss
        - All right. If you guys will look at the passage. If you look at number, the number two paragraph
        - So make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too. Okay.
        - It tells you in paragraph three, does everyone see that
        - do you know what a lunar orbiter is.
        - Oh, it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah. Stop right there for a minute. OK. So paragraph 2 says that NASA has sent a small-        - you did a great job rating by the way. But, and Farrah, you did too. Very good job reading. So paragraph 2 says on this worksheet that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater. I'm sorry, in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. So we know that the ice deposits are very small. So you're going to need something to-        - small, right? Something that can look at small things, correct?
        - Okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Is that the amount of water that.
        - Okay, so that could be a benefit of having water. So let's talk more about that. Who's the they that you're talking about.
        - So do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples.
        - Well, I guess I'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment.
        - A lunar orbiter. Discovering orbiting, looking around. Used to investigate. 
        - Well, I, I guess, I thought the microscope was that tool because um how, how can you find something if you can't even see it.
        - Exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right, so that is the equipment that NASA send or scientist sent to the moon.
        - And you type in your answer, you said they need the microscope to look real closely. Why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon. What is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it. Yes, Oliver?
        - that's a really good point Farrah and I I think what they used the Lunar orbiter for was to investigate where there might be the deposits of water.
        - Because what did the Lunar orbiter do.
        - Luis have you used a microscope before? 
        - Well, how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope.
        - And we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water, which, in turn, we use the microscope, because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon.
        - I still think that the small machine. Is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well, it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things, you know, and they investigate. So I still think it's in paragraph two,
        - I wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there.
        - Very good what's this small machine called?
        - And what I want you guys to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two, and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so Farrah have a question before we get started.
        - okay so what it says in part two, investigates in the polar craters.
        - um you mean like in the story?
        - Good. Did they give a name for what the machine was called
        - Go ahead. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - RER: No, it's too small
        - and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there. Okay.
        - Yeah, sure. And you know I also, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells.
        - So you discover that there was water on the moon. What equipment did they use? You can look back in the text to help you.
        - Right, and what was that machine called?
        - Though the paragraph that you guys read did it tell you what they meant by valuable.
        - So if we go back and read this sentence that I'm Chris read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter. And what did that lunar orbiter do so.
        - On the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence. You might be able to bring us to the right answer. Can you read that out loud for us, where
        - Excellent Farrah Thank you so much. So Oliver, what what kind of tool were they using there? they were they were looking for water. What were they doing, what were they using?
        - Okay, and Jazmin, you are correct. NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine.
        - The article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water-        - a convincing argument for why this would be useful. What does it tell us that the problems could be? What's the issue with the research? It's at the very end of the article.
        - In that part they talked about the lunar orbiter I guess.
        - Can you think of, can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water?
        - Have you
        - And then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits.
        - That that NASA is using this to form the ice deposits
        - Yes, it does and what what does something do when it orbits.
        - Let's go back into the texts and look
        - Yeah, it was, um, in paragraph two, it's in the first sentence.
        - Other ways
        - Um, so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon. Right. So, so I'm looking at, paragraph two, right now it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits, and can you make a connection to the microscope now Farrah.
        - Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?
        - Chris, how did you feel about this article, and what what sense, did you get from it.
        - And how does that relate back to the question?
        - They might need tools from a traditional toolbox as well i'm sure they need lots of different things as they do their exploration on the moon.
        - Excuse me, Miss Brown?
        - Because it's so small, like the the particles of water are so are so tiny
        - Okay, so oxygen tanks is a really important tool, like you had mentioned earlier, obviously, they would not be able to breathe, give me one second okay i'm just gonna ask Luis a quick question.
        - But I'm in the text.
        - They saw the US deposit. It's in the large polar crater.
        - If we look at, paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine, which is what you wrote what comes next.
        - Wait, I have to, I have to write down all the other stuff that you just said?
        - Okay, what is that small machine.
        - So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon. 
        - Awesome. So in the texts that you guys read, they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there. But I want to kind of make it a little more clear for everyone because the microscope.
        - It says that you, you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight
        - So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope all right.
        - Or to investigate the ice deposits, but
        - Okay
        - So, the less weight, I can turn that rocket the more money I'm going to save. 
        - Um, yeah. So I did a look, I think. So I'm going to guess that I didn't, you were saying, I didn't answer the question, right, because the question was, how did the scientists what equipment. Did the scientists use to discover water and I just was talking about the creative. Right, right.
        - We need air to breathe. Did they have air on the moon yet.
        - So can anybody summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have, how did they work together in this article.
        - Hmm. Well, they do use the microscope to be able to look at the microscopic things on the moon, to find the water that they were digging with the equipment. 
        - The purpose is to find ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Now, how did they use the Lunar orbiter to find water, you said that they looked for ice deposits right.
        - So they found the water and used the microscope to use        - to see the water because it was so tiny. But what did they do to find it? Do you remember?
        - It might not be like full bodies of water, but we have ice right and what does ice made out of.
        - Awesome. Yep, so smart. So why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts? What could those things-        - what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for? What do we use oxygen for?
        - Yes, but let me ask you a further question. Could they just send a microscope to space and find water.
        - Now I want. I want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and Deb, I saw that in your answer. You had similar
        - Yes, and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage
        - Broken down into two parts, because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen. Why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else.
        - What is that machine called
        - Yep Okay perfect, so let's go down to that section. 
        - so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find
        - Okay. How many of you guys were looking for the word water in the in the passage
        - what is a microscope and what does it do for us.
        - So we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
        - That while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water.
        - But so Chris and Jazmin, so that they found the two tools of equipment right so
        - okay Nice nice So what do we use a microscope for.
        - um it said The lunar orbiter in paragraph two.
        - I thought the Lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when I read that that that text really closely, it looks like they use the Lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water.
        - In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. So this is the machine that actually went and explored.
        - Why is it called the Lunar lunar orbiter, by the way, why, why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but Luis.
        - What do astronauts use the water for
        - Kind of like if you're playing basketball.
        - Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?
        - Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water. So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer.
        - they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water.
        - The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want all of you to look in paragraph three
        - Well, my answer, my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there.
        - The second paragraph.
        - Look at paragraph five.
        - But I'm wondering, Farrah could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with NASA in the moon is a desert and Oliver while, while she's reading, could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water?
        - So I think can everyone recognize that there are two places in the text that talk about where we find something or water on the moon?
        - Um, yeah, I could try to look for reasons, um, I just think that like it just seems like it's not, you know what I mean. Cuz it's not ready yet. Like it would take such a long time to be useful. You know what I mean, so it didn't seem very convincing, because it seems like we'd hav to use. But yeah I can look and see.
        - To look for the water on the moon. 
        - Yeah, yeah. My dad would totally need that.
        - And to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon. Um, what other functions, water has
        - So there's no water on the moon, then what are they in order for astronauts to go to the moon and have water, what do they need to do?
        - OK. So let's look back in the text. It says, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters. So where can we find water on the moon? Or where can water be found?
        - Oh, so before they can use the microscope. They have to use something else.
        - So that's when you have to go back and you have to, you know, dig in a little deeper to find you know where they're talking about water on the moon and what they what piece of equipment. Did they use for that.
        - Right. Oh, I'm, I'm all okay I don't know.
        - yeah awesome Chris and that's exactly what investigate means so NASA used the Lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water.
        - Oh wait, so you said why couldn't they see the ice.
        - Oh yeah, I think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Yeah I wanted to say so, actually, I went to NASA and I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So let's talk about the actual tools that were used, which I know some of you used in your explanation. Anybody want to raise their hand and just list, maybe, one of the tools that were used, a specific tool that the scientists used. Farrah?
        - can anybody think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate. 
        - Right. But what is the text tell you about it.
        - Then yeah all those other cool machines come into play, after the fact, after they're able to find the water. 
        - That was a great description. Yeah, I'm looking in the text now and I see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines.
        - Oh well, I guess, like the passage is saying like, you have to use the microscope.
        - And why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon.
        - And the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits, which is another form of water right I use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon.
        - Yeah, let's look at number two, that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me.
        - Not sure. Okay. Well, you just read paragraph three again. Maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three. What about number two?
        - Okay, great so you talked about a scientific tool called a microscope, can you tell me a little bit about what they use the microscope to look at.
        - It it's a tool, a piece of equipment and that's why I picked it for my answer, because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - oh the craters that was part of my answer.
        - Yes. And what could the hydrogen
        -  Now I'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe. So if water can provide oxygen. Would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon.
        - yeah I was just gonna jump in because I definitely know this one. Orbiter means like to go around.
        - Um, well, okay, so there's a couple places on paragraph two, they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph, paragraph three, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.
        - It says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places, wherever, or where the sun never shines.
        - rocket fuel is how you would how you would move the spaceship so it's like.
        - Yeah they did, and this caused a big crash.
        - it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials.
        - Oh, I think it's in paragraph number five.
        - um Oliver and Farrah and Chris you guys read the fourth paragraph right What did you guys think could be useful, there are, what did that tell you about the water.
        - So you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it.
        - Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps...
        - Jazmin, you said that they use a small machine. So great job, recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon. Do you remember what the name of the machine was called?
        - Well, actually I looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, right now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question I was so helpful Thank you so much.
        - um let's unpack that a bit So what is the small machine do.
        - So NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate So what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for.
        - Right. So let's look at where it says that its on paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope.
        - Very good. And there was another word in that sentence that you've read that also has to that will give us a clue of the word discover. Do you know what that word is?
        - Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits. 
        - Well, what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do Farrah you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it, what do you.
        - And it was what did it do
        - Oh, yes. Yes, right. I forgot about that.
        - lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Okay, can you tell me how they found it.
        - But if they're already on the moon, they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so.
        - RER: Is it investigate?
        - So I know that the scientists back in paragraph one, they found out that there was water on the moon because they had craters that had ice in them. But how did they find out that the craters had ice in them. Do you remember how that happened. We just read a little part of it.
        - Okay, so I read a thing right and i'm I see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits I.
        - Your response, which I think points us to a different part of the text that also mentions um discovering.
        - You are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples, at least two examples.
        - Ice deposits.
        - But Chris you're on the right track with finding ice deposits. Does anyone know the similarity between ice deposits and water?
        -  that's really cool I I wish the story said that.
        - and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah. 
        - Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used?
        - So do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship.
        - I want you guys to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope.  I want you to think.  
        - Does anyone know or have you heard that word before. Microscope.
        - Yeah, that was part of my answer. They found the craters of water and the craters were full of water.
        - So breathing would be a good use for the oxygen. What about the hydrogen?
        - It was important. So let's, it was very important, because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen, oxygen, and you can take those things that
        - Okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits
        - Thank you for reading that. It was very helpful. So looking back in that. What did you find what kind of equipment.
        - That make sense.
        - And that helps your car to go. Without the gas, your car won't go. Just like the rocket fuel, which is made out of different strands of the hydrogen and also some oxygen. That would fill their gas tank, so they can move out and go throughout space.
        - is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things.
        - Well, I don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it, it can find that ice in the craters.
        - So that's kind of like a little microscope. And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-        - Chris?
        - i'm so sorry for himself when he described it, this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page.
        - You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely. So what is that microscope, helping them do guys
        - And the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel.
        - The water is heavy. And if there was water on the moon, then they wouldn't have to carry it, which would be a lot of drain on their fuel supply, and it would also take up a lot of space in their spacecraft. So being able to stop somewhere and pick up water is a lot better than having to carry it around with you all the time. And water is heavy.
        - NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter.
        - But so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text.
        -  And they're looking for ice deposits, but the ice deposits are very small. So the amount of water that they find is going to be very small. Right.
        - Oh, you have a problem here. Can you explain more about the small machine, what tell us more about what the machine is. I mean, what did the scientist call the small machine?
        - You can't really find water using the microscope. It's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope.
        - Yeah. And then after that it also talks about small ice deposits, which then
        - Like in paragraph two
        - This in the beginning of the end of paragraph two, they say ice deposits are very small.
        - Was used. Does anybody remember what it was used to do.
        - Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called
        - um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice.
        - But back to the text. Um Jazmin, I really like your
        - My mom says it a lot.
        - Small machine called.
        - And that it investigates so that's why NASA sends it up there. 
        - What do you know about ice Oliver
        - But how much water is on the moon.
        - we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't.
        - It's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things
        - Do you think you could try to Read the question and maybe look at the text.
        - makes perfect sense Thank you so much okay that makes sense I'm not confused
        - They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it.
        - Exactly, so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon, and that actually brings up a fantastic point about.
        - So we know what headings are in our text. So there are two headings here. The first heading is the moon is a desert. It's the bolted words, who can read to me what the second heading is
        - . Does anybody remember where they found the water?
        - So at NASA they have like Farrah said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and.
        - Yeah okay, we can look at it.
        - Yeah. So what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits
        - When these discovered this tiny water. Then after that, they use the microscope carries and being
        - So they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both.
        -  So it was in paragraph two, the first sentence. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon?
        - to fuel the rockets, or they can use it to help us breathe so Luis that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Right yeah because it's cold so good good So these are all great clues that we all help on fighting together, 
        - Okay, so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do, based on our reading. Farrah. Can you tell us what do you think?
        - Well, let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter.
        - Now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module. Right. And this is one of those tools that you probably saw at NASA Chris when you went to go visit
        - Exactly, so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what.
        - Before
        - If the water's frozen?
        - Yeah. And if we go back. It actually says that we need a microscope to see the water. So it's really, really small and spread over a really large area. Isn't it.
        - Um, ok. 
        - yeah right so in depth, maybe our friend, can you share with you some of their experiences, but like you said Farrah microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them.
        - Um, well, it's like, I think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope.
        - Yeah so wasn't just water. So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon. It was ice. 
        - Okay, well, a microscope and helps you see things that are really, really small and in the story except the water was really, really small microscopic.
        - Sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine. But the real name of the machine was a microscope.
        - Um, well, it looks like the microscope is there to study the water. Um, and, like, look at it really closely.
        - and the Lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right?
        - was my answer is, it is.
        - Oh OK, so to look really closely at what.
        - Okay, well, I know that we can breathe oxygen, and so they could breathe it.
        - yeah yeah exactly.
        - um in part one or part two?
        - Oh no, I mean I've been a NASA and I saw the Mars Rover, but I don't know what a lunar orbiter is.
        - Yeah, I can imagine. I guess I'm still kind of use, like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find
        - On.
        - yeah that could be really cool imagine if there was a gas station like on the moon.
        - And can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about?
        - Oh well, I was just gonna say that, okay. So I went to NASA with my dad and when he and I went to NASA together, we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks And masks. So I was kind of wondering about that.
        - It said, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Using small machine that Jazmin identified
        - Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah, because ice is just frozen water.
        - Okay, so in our text on the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Oh, I just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch, but I wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful Thank you so much i'm.
        - So Luis, just go back. So the lunar orbiter was used. It was a small machine sent by NASA to look for ice deposits and craters.
        - I don't know.
        - Yes, so did you'll find a place in the passage, you can do that.
        - Remember, the atmosphere is what you breathe, the oxygen and--
        - yeah cuz, then the thing about carrying the water wouldn't be an issue okay astronauts could breathe oxygen hydrogen also be used as rocket fuel oh that's what you said.
        - It tells us that it tells us that it's really small, like, whatever it is, because it says it's microscopic
        - What do they use to find the craters.
        - Like in paragraph five, there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable. How could it be used
        - Oh, um, you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on
        - And then afterwards, they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it.
        - What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came.
        - yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts, but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there.
        - Right, they just use the Lunar Orbiter. Right. So yes, they may when when astronauts goes, they may use all that equipment but they didn't send astronauts. They sent a lunar orbiter.
        - mm hmm and let's Maybe you can think a little bit, we can break down that nate, and so do you know what lunar means.
        - So you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient
        - Yes. And so you have to look at it under that microscope, and that's where what Farrah was talking about.
        - Well, I guess it finds and that I in the craters.
        - Okay, perfect. So then in the second paragraph, it talks about NASA using this small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So what they're doing is that they're using the Orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters. Does that make sense.
        - There's a clue in paragraph five, yes Luis.
        - um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def.
        - Did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful.
        - Okay, well, okay, okay. In the first paragraph. It says, scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep in the moon's polar craters, and if they find that.
        - What details that it gave about they asked deposits
        - Oh... no? No.
        - Do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment.
        - We get, I think it would be like, yes, it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already. And then they could just build their even, and they could see it right there. 
        - Okay, let's see. So paragraph two, the name of small machine was the Lunar Orbiter
        - And I was just gonna ask about my response, actually, so my response was NASA said just small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Was there any other equipment that was used in the text.
        - It said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them, in the moon's craters, but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny, tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope. 
        - What else, what else do we mean Oliver besides water.
        - Exactly. They sent a lunar orbiter have up there. And so, Chris. Do you know what a lunar orbiter is
        - Water on the moon, because in these three facts that I'm going to read out there will be some answers in there. So I want everyone to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out
        - And Farrah. So you said the scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Do you remember the second machine?
        - Like on the top and the bottom.
        - You were talking about how, in paragraph three, it talks about the.
        - You have to go to our next class, but thank you so much, it was really interesting to meet you, Mr T and to talk to you Thank you so much.
        - If we look at number two.
        - Well, I guess, I don't know I guess that's my question because I thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon, how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles.
        - orbiter just like Luis said, has to do with going around 
        - What what's that step in between so Farrah, can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the Lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that Farrah.
        - that's a really good question um but let's take a look at paragraph three let's see what it says.
        - Okay, so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me
        - You can use them for rocket fuel can do you can use both of them?
        - Think it's NASA and oh actually I went to NASA and so I know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - And microscope is one of the pieces of equipment, but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment. 
        - Okay um well Farrah told us about part of it, but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope.
        - The third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question.
        - is the one that Oliver said.
        - Um, so that you can like go up to the moon.
        - Okay, so in our article that we had, talking about water on the moon, I agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found. What kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at?
        - Oliver. What do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text. 
        - Alright um and does that sound.
        - You have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon.
        - So you underlined equipment and discover. Great. So tell me, just reading our passage Jazmin. Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment. Did the scientists discover water on the moon with
        - You know, I guess not. Like, there really isn't other. It's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text.
        - and you had written. NASA send a small machine which is true in paragraph to it describes it as being a small machine, but then right after it says it's a small machine it says called and I feel like we need to focus on that word, because what does NASA call small machine in the paragraph.
        - um yeah Jazmin it's like it's kind of like a robot right.
        - I wrote this one in my answer. They're using the microscope to look really closely at the water.
        - yeah okay um at the very end, part three, um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - How about Farrah. I loved your answer. When you talked about the microscope. Have you ever seen a microscope.
        - Oh, okay. So which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon.
        - Like frozen water. Oh.
        - And how it relates to finding water
        - Okay, and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use?
        - So I think what might help us is to maybe, you know, over the passage, a little bit. I think specifically part to see if we can all find the passage. 
        - Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own
        - I would say I would say probably no.
        - Exactly. But can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited. I can read you the sentence if you'd like.
        - Now how Jazmin, do you, can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go
        - Oh so i'm the machine, it can do the finding, even if it can't see it.
        - Yes, I think that's a really great way of putting it, it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be, and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah Chris.
        - but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article.
        - if you look back in your text, you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater. 
        - But Mr. Teacher. I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that. OK?
        - These craters are dark places where the sun never shines.
        - Maybe this machine, the small machine this lunar orbiter as Chris said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon.
        - No, it is much better, like the water was on the moon, because then the ship doesn't have to carry all that water, and it will make the ship more heavy yes even.
        - Yeah, but what would it tell us that involves water?
        - Are you hearing person what is water, made up of.
        - So that's less stuff they have to care or, you know, to bring with them on the spaceship, so they can have room for more people, more supplies and things like that. So that's a very good response they have you got a question, buddy.
        - Since I was just
        - Yes. So according to that passage Chris, what is the what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water
        - that's good and Chris it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again, it is on spaces eaten pointed out, which I find super exciting Luis find super exciting.
        - Yeah, I guess I was wondering. So it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water, and I was thinking that-        - because I said that they must have used the microscope. So I guess I was wondering why my answer was wrong?
        - Out of water, they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool, but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it.
        - Oh, like pick one of the ones in the story.
        - So I think what I'm wondering is, like, okay, so if the lunar orbiter was this machine, and it went up there, did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like, was it the thing that like kind of found the water. Um, I wonder, like, I feel like I feel like, are both Farrah and my answer correct?
        - When we look back over the text in paragraph two, um, what, what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. So what equipment did they use?
        - Oh yes, yes. Yes, yes.
        - So what Farrah just said, was in the third paragraph and she's talking about the tool called a microscope.
        - I agree, but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs, what knowledge, are we getting from those 
        - Oh, okay. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the South Pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater. These two positives, very small.
        - No, so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher, I was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular.
        - Oh well, um well, I thought it was the microscope to just like Farrah I circled the same the same the same thing, but what you just said.
        - And ice is really hard to get through. Right, so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing
        - Yeah, because everybody said it. 
        - i'm sure that they bring, maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each, but I think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water, because that's really happy, but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring.
        - Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment.
        - Yeah. Yeah. Actually, yes, it
        - I got this one I got this one.
        - That is true. It was, it's like, it's so as Jazmin was saying it's a machine. So they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts. 
        - Let's look at that paragraph number two. What machine did they use in that paragraph?
        - Yeah, okay. So, yeah, okay. So I think that what they use was like oxygen tanks and stuff like that. Like Chris was saying. And I know a lot about space. So they probably use like some kind of like pack to like drink water from and like all that kind of stuff.
        - In that sense, the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen. But why do you. Why do you think that using the text. Why do you think that NASA would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts.
        - And as I was talking about with Oliver that the scientists weren't actually sent out to NASA. I'm fine. NASA. NASA sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so
        - Why did they need a microscope, why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah Farrah
        - Okay, well, it says so, the ice deposits are like the water actually, It's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually Chris, I think it says it's really small, it's microscopic.
        - The oxygen tanks.
        - Can anyone explain how they did that.
        - You wouldn't even know that it was there, why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to.
        - When we go there  we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice, so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place
        - But if you think back to Farrah response, she said I referred to the text and I thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text, what do you notice about the specific tools, it says they used to discover water on the moon.
        - Answer to Farrah, so do. Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter.
        - So what does it say in the second paragraph.
        - Well, let's look at this sentence right here. It says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. So what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see?
        - And what is the Lunar orbiter look for.
        - Alright, so, um, can anyone tell me what paragraph, did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon?
        - Alright, so you have the word equipment, but let's take it one step further, what specific piece of equipment is being used.
        - But that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon, and not actually going in the crater how, how does it find the ice it's in the crater. Farrah do you have any thoughts on that.
        - Let me see. NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - The robot that Jazmin was mentioning for them, the small machine.
        - Who can tell me the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate.
        - Yeah, we've used it in science class before
        - (WHISPERING) The Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits. Ice deposits?
        - mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's South pole. 
        - Yeah, yeah, it was called the lunar orbiter. 
        - cool great so we see the word Luna or moon Thank you Jazmin inside of lunar I also want to think about the word polar craters what word, do you see inside of the word polar.
        - Does the article tell us that water is light, or is water heavy?
        - Do you guys think it would be helpful If we already had if we didn't have to Make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us, do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too.
        - What did NASA do. How about that, who can answer that first question. 
        - So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and
        - Go back and look what's another word that we can use Jazmin.
        - Oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators, full of water.
        - If you look at paragraph 3, it says the water they found is microscopic. And that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it. But Farrah told us that the article says that in order to see the water, we would need what, Farrah?
        - So what is it asking us
        - uhm lunar means... lunar means the moon
        - Yeah, the microscope. So can you tell me what is the main. Um, what do you use the microscope for?
        - microscopic the me thank you for finding that can anyone tell me what microscopic me.
        - Usually, they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon, try to see if anyone from earth can be able to live in the moon, yes Oliver.
        - I'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. So I wanted to say goodbye and thanks for for
        - Okay, [reads to herself] NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate . The lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. The ice deposits are very small.
        - So let's see, paragraph number two, where we found out about the lunar orbiter that Jazmin's discussing
        - The water on the main for
        - So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together. 
        - No they're not. They're not full at all. There's such a tiny amount of water that it's almost, you have to have a special tool to see it.
        - We know that NASA sent the small machine. What was it called
        - Yes, and I really liked how many supers you use because they have to zoom and even though, as Chris said the craters very big the amount of water, they can find is very, very small.
        - You that like the water
        - um I think it's a machine that goes around.
        - A lunar orbiter. That's right. And let's look at number three, I want you
        - Oh, oh, yeah, ice is the same thing as water.
        - yeah well, I mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe, and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there.
        - and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means.
        - Yeah, so can we have ice without water?
        - So if we go back and the text. Let me go back
        - So I want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something all the way out into space Using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon?
        - Before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water 
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth. The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it.
        - Um, well, I mean, when I was looking at it. I did see they they talked about the machine and in paragraph two,
        - If you read the text again.
        - What else is valuable. Is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable.
        - it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert 
        - And investigate. You're right. That's looking to find the water. But as we see it in the third paragraph. It says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found.
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter, Jazmin, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small. Okay. So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier.
        - Okay Oliver or Sabina, what do you guys use a microscope for
        - All right, go back and look again and see if there's something another Oliverice or another equipment that was mentioned. Yes, Jazmin?
        - Um NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - And they have been able to send those things in space, instead of just people.
        - awesome what did you find in that sentence.
        - Good. And do you know what that small machine is called
        - Does anyone remember. Where's the, where's the water exactly on the moon. What part of the moon.
        - the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes.
        - When I read it.
        - yeah that's the water.
        - so we already identified that in paragraph three there's a microscope as a tool can anyone find a tool in paragraph two.
        - OK, perfect. The water they found in the craters, right?
        - and greater.
        - Awesome. Hi, everyone. So I was just going over your responses. Farrah, you say that they need a microscope to look really closely. What are they looking closely at?
        - And in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter. So that was the equipment that the NASA had sent up to the space. It's equipment using it. Um,
        - It looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Well, once they get to the moon, they would drink the water on the moon, so I mean.
        - Why did they need the microscope?
        - Well, this says that you need a microscope to look at it.
        - Um, we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it
        - It's ok. So is there any similarity between ice and water? Does anyone know the similarity between ice and water?
        - What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?
        - The machine is the lunar orbiter.
        - Because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits, right?
        - But there's a certain Tool and I want us to go back in the text and find where it says, um, that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment, um, to investigate the water on the moon.
        - Well, that's a great point. So the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate. So that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it. So we need to use that piece of technology to find the water
        - Yeah. Did you notice I'm a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water
        - And then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope.
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine. What was that machine called?
        - They did. NASA did use a small machine. Can you tell me what that small machine was?
        - You know, to Chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment, because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the Lunar orbiter the equipment and the Oliver what's up.
        - You wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,
        - um well, it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it.
        - Right. That is an important thing. So it can be separated out. You can use the oxygen. The astronauts could use that to breathe. And they can also use that for fuel, with hydrogen and the oxygen, if they separate it out into the atoms, they can make fuel out of it.
        - Um yeah I got it it said, well, I mean you just read it, it says lunar orbiter that's the name
        - So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar.
        - Well, it lets you look at things that are really small.
        - Probably not because I think it would melt and then probably a very.
        - Right, so we're looking at microscopic micro being small. The reason why you have to use a microscope, you can't see it with your naked eye.
        - Okay. So the first part is I want you to take your pencil or your tablet pin and let's reread the part of the text where it describes the type of machine that was used
        - but Chris, you brought up a great point. They use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one. Do you guys remember what the other equipment that they used
        - Oh yeah well I definitely have.
        - That's a really good point. So to answer your question, further, let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert. Okay, but now I know that's not true.
        - Or maybe they use something else.
        - You don't know so i'm going to read you guys, paragraph three, and then I would love to hear you guys I would love to hear if you guys think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it.
        - Teacher : Right, so where in the article. Do you see a sentence that starts with NASA sent
        - But the important tool is the basketball itself.
        - And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money. Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have. 
        - But something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why I don't think astronauts are on this mission.
        - You're right, it is the lunar lunar orbiter they use that to find the water on the moon. And did they find a lot of water or a little water.
        - What can hydrogen be used for?
        - Okay yeah so in part one, it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters.
        - That one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the Lunar Orbiter, but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on Earth, get a closer look to the moon 
        - Awesome. So you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right 
        - The water because the water is the ice deposit. So they're using it to investigate the water on the moon. Does anyone have any questions about that?
        - Okay. So when you say NASA send a small machine. Do you know exactly what that machine was called
        - Yeah, I said that they used the microscope.
        - Oh yeah astronaut.
        - Found types of equipment. Then we want to look and see which one's the best. So let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope. So we are on the first page in paragraph number three. So, Farrah. Would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us, please.
        - So that's where I found that extra knowledge and maybe I could even share that video with you all some time to it seems like something you might be interested in.
        - Yeah, I can look
        - I'm yeah, I'm okay. And I said, you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water. Yeah.
        - yeah well, I mean, I think that microscope is like small.
        - I forgot about that part yeah I did read that part.
        - RER: It looks I used to pause it in a large polar crater.
        - In this paragraph. What do you think it talks about what's the main thing.
        - what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes.
        - The small machine, what is this machine.
        - So did I need, um, you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely. So did they use a microscope to find it, or just a look at it.
        - yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope.
        - No. No, I don't know.
        - Yeah. So if we're thinking about the water found on the moon. Are we thinking about, like,
        - Well, when she read it, it said to look at it really closely.
        - Yes. And what was that small machine called. Do you remember
        - now Farrah in your answer in your response you named a type of machine. What was that machine.
        - RER: A lunar orbiter
        - mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks, because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what.
        - really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time, you know the technology and the science does not exist, to be able to do this yet.
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that information but in a connection to the text and the question.
        - Jazmin could you tell your classmates How was it that they found that there was water on the moon.
        - Exactly. Because plant cells are also really small, like the water on the moon that Oliver mentioned.
        - We're funding water. So do you think        - does that make any sense? So what is the microscope, what does the microscope do?
        - and, let me read this, um, you said, it, Luis, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?
        - mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right.
        - Yes, I found my answer in paragraph two, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Yes, very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water.
        - Oh. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know.
        - Right, so that there's some evidence behind that and we breathe in oxygen, there's evidence of that. Correct.
        - And let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, which is where I think.
        - That is correct. What about anything else? anyone else noticed anything in the reading?
        - Look for ice deposits
        - Well, yours is correct, but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text
        -  just like now is the Lunar New Year it's the complete cycle of the moon.
        - Luis Thank you so much for sharing that Luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon,
        - you would definitely, they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water,
        - what did they find these with
        - So if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. Does that stand to say anything about any equipment?
        - Ok you're done. So, from what i've heard from you guys, you guys circled two words. The first word was microscope and the second was the small machine. Does anyone know the difference between these two types of equipment? Anything, any guesses is fine, from what you see in the reading. Luis, go ahead.
        - Gotcha. So did they discover it with the microscope.
        - This is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon.
        - To be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye, you needed the microscope to be able to really
        - yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water, but when they're doing this, they might not be doing this on the moon, so, if you look at the second paragraph, can you read the first sentence for me.
        -  But what was in paragraph two, in the very first sentence? Let's see if we can find exactly what they used.
        - yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water So what do we think is the Lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing.
        - Good job. And what did they discover in those ice deposits
        - awesome Luis and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.
        - Day now is the technology ready
        - Yeah, that's true. Right? So they say that they looked for so that like Jazmin said
        - Right. It says they sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So that was step one. 
        - Oh yeah we have them in the science lab we use them in science.
        - Is there something else that they maybe brought?
        - What is it investigating for what are we looking for and.
        - So we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate
        - yeah I think you.
        - But is there, another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um.
        - And what does the a stamp or what is the O stands for.
        - All like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see. And the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff.
        - But I want you to look, I want everyone to look on paragraph 2 where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Do you think that this refers to the question at all?
        - When you think of a desert. Do you think of what do you think, what do you see
        - Does anybody know what microscopic means?
        - Okay, let's not stray too far and understand that, you know, a lot of this information, but we want to find the answer here in the paragraph that you read
        - you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead Chris.
        - We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?.
        - And another one? The microscope. That's not it?
        - yeah, I guess so, so it looks around the moon and somehow I don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits.
        - because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters.
        - So it's actually both of them. So in our text in the second bullet point, it says that NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, they used both the Lunar Orbiter.
        - What type of ice
        - yeah I do because it's it's kind of part of my answer, they use the word microscopic and so that's why I said you'd need a microscope to discover the water, so you can look at it really closely.
        - Implemented a really interesting strategy, they basically threw a piece of the Atlas rocket at the moon.
        - That's right. That's very good. And if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope. But in this case, they haven't actually landed on the moon. They're simply using the Lunar Orbiter to study the moon from a distance. So, so Oliver.
        - Okay. And part two. I'm. Oh, oh man, oh I just looked at the clock and it's time for us to lunch, but
        - So if you all would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled
        - Oh, I think I can I can do it.
        - Or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day? 
        - They did so once they actually found the water. Then they use the microscope to see it. So they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water. Does that make more sense.
        - yeah exactly so we take that ice right we take, we find the water particles and we want to use that in the future so that we can go to the moon, and we could stay there long periods of time and and Luis going back to you and how you know so much about.
        - Robots are awesome. 
        - Now when you discover something you're correct, it doesn't it doesn't say discover.
        - They're really small. What else are they? what are the ice deposits, what did we just say?
        - Moon. Yeah. So basically, it gets a closer look. I was thinking
        - Oh, I don't know.
        - Oh, and what is a microscope.
        - The microscope, the microscope.
        - And you know I read that there was there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - They need to use a microscope to be able to see the water, the small amounts of water. So again, if you if you're thinking about now going forward. When you think about the climate of the moon. Think about a desert. The, the text itself. Said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on Earth.
        - You don't remember. Okay, that's totally fine. Let's look at the passage and see, just like with Luis Let's look at the second paragraph.
        - They said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water.
        - So you have used to it. Have you ever. What have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing, right.
        - That would be referring to us, we would need a microscope.
        - That article had a lot of detail about what that's all machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon.
        - yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water, it sounds like that's what happened in this article.
        - If you look back in your text, it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - Right, can you tell me what a desert is?
        - Okay. Basically
        - This small machine, so we've talked about other machines, but I think she's thinking about the one that actually like got.
        - it's like how i'm gas as for our car.
        - You said, you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely, which is which is very true. But do you know what we're looking closely at?
        - um to look at stuff that's really small, so I don't understand why my answer was wrong.
        - We're looking at the water on the moon. 
        - So in the text. It tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves.
        - The whole reading, she is talking about water on the moon. So really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon, and they would be using that water from the moon.
        - Kind of look in the text and. Who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon.
        - And I know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery.
        - Like really, really small.
        - So if scientists are using a tool called a microscope. What does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at
        - All right, what is the oxygen tank being used for.
        - yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely.
        - Yeah, I was a lunar orbitre
        - But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters. Correct?
        - Well let's see the water they found is microscopic you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so let's see if we can make an inference who can tell me what influences.
        - A lunar
        - Oh yeah. No, I totally we've done that before and science, like we've looked at like the plant like cells and stuff like that. So yeah, I've seen lots of stuff with microscopes. 
        - And can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does. So like you said. They said the small machine. What did they use it for just. Can you guys just remind me.
        - um yeah so lunar means moon, so you guys anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them.
        - Oh okay okay.
        - yeah so that's quite I mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them.
        - Don't really know because I know that it looks for them, but I don't really know what it does. Next, I don't think it's
        - And in paragraph two, the very last sentence, it says these icy deposits are very small.
        - So i'm going to give you two minutes to read the text and really closely read it with the question keep the questions in mind as you're reading.
        - What are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for.
        - And then the second sentence underline that one as well. This lunar orbiter will land at the most South Pole and look for ice deposits. OK, now let's go on to the third paragraph so. 
        - a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it, but the microscope itself did not get it all the way up to the moon okay.
        - Perfect. Alright. So do you think that might be where we look for our answers, guys.
        - Jazmin can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process.
        - Yes, the small machine. But let's look back and see what that's called. So let's read the sentence. Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So
        - But we're looking for. This is this specific name of that machine. Does anyone remember what that's called.
        - I would say tiny.
        - yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know.
        - Do you remember what they called that machine science has all sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was
        - Okay, so since since story didn't talk about those things, then it's not the right answer.
        - Right. So let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine.
        - Um, it's like really small.
        - oh well, I think Jazmin said it goes in the craters and finds the the water.
        - Is it is, it's about people going to the moon?
        - So let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to.
        - Yeah. So if you look at your passage you want to use the passage. The second half, which is paragraphs four, five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful.
        - And they they used all that over a course of you know, probably many months, and they and they somehow found.
        - Do you know we just read about it. You want me to read it again.
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Right, so can you go back and look if there's another machine or equipment that was mentioned in the passage?
        - Okay, so because, when they found the water, it was really small, they have to see it on they have to use the microscope to look at it, they can't see it without the microscope.
        - It did not clarify, did it? So maybe this could have been an unmanned mission and they just send the machinery and the lunar orbiter was part of the bigger machine that discovered the water.
        - I don't know what we use hydrogen for.
        -  so you had the right answer about a small machine, but then after they find the they found the ice deposits, they had to use something else to like look at it more closely.
        - Breathe in.
        - Oh, I, I don't see the word sample on in the story, but it talks about the
        - You can find that in paragraph six
        - Investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small.
        - Let's go back to the text and see if that's true. Can anybody find in the text where it says
        - If you look in the second sentence.
        - So in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters, and that making the plan, it would take a lot of time. And it would take a lot of money. They would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface. And they would have to build new equipment. So if NASA didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment, those things could be a problem. 
        - yeah does anybody know what investigate means?
        - So when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon, and then does anyone know the definition of orbiter or orbit can anyone share that with me.
        - I was acutally kind of confused, because I wasn't sure, we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right. So, I was kind of wondering like, why is my answer wrong.
        - Very scientific tool to.
        - and Chris, looking at the text, can you explain what the Lunar orbiter did?
        - You find something?
        - So can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon.
        - We use the microscope you know, to look at really small things in science class.
        - Yeah, right there.
        - Um, in that sentence. It goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does. Can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does
        -  A lunar orbiter is doing a different job. They called a lunar orbiter to what?
        - On they sent the small machine. The Lunar Orbiter.
        - Exactly. And in paragraph one, what does it say that the future astronauts could do
        - Okay, great that is a piece of equipment that they use, can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is.
        - Um, yeah. Well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really wanted to thank you for working with us.
        - I'm glad you know that, but it's also in the text. Could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me.
        - Um, so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small
        - They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic. That makes sense?
        - In paragraph three, what does it say about
        - Oh. No. No, it's dry. It says dry.
        - And so I guess like that's where basically like investigate can you find it, but also study it, but you have to find it and then study
        - they're really small.
        - of why finding water on the moon, is important.
        - Oh, like to look at, to like, look for something
        - Okay. And so when you look at that word. Let's look at that word again where it says that, it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing?
        - The lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do Chris.
        - Can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample?
        - The ice deposits.
        - And do you know why based on the reading. They sent the Lunar Orbiter.
        - um so my answer is NASA sent a small machine.
        - gotcha Okay, thank you.
        - So those ice deposits held what
        - Okay well in paragraph three, they do use the word found it says All water they found was microscopic.
        - Oh, I know the answer to this one. I know.
        - And then, now that we've all understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope. Like Farrah said
        - yeah cuz I went to NASA actually I went to NASA and and when I was there I saw I saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - And you're right. So they did use a small machine. Do you know what the name of that machine was
        - Well yeah, I think.
        - Um, so it has to be that Lunar Orbiter. Yeah, I thought I was the microscope to Farrah, but now I changed my mind.
        - What is it telling us Chris, I appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away.
        - I think that there's a word for that. Does anyone remember what word they use to describe how small the water i? Farrah.
        - Well, I went to NASA. So I know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Definitely. 
        - That I got a shirt with that picture on it, and everything.
        - We know it's a small machine, but if my machine could be anything, how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is.
        - No, so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph, so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph? Jazmin.
        - I'm okay. Yeah. So I read I read that sentence after
        - It's definitely small.
        - paragraph to paragraph two,
        - However, I want us to take a look at the reading specifically
        - About oxygen tanks. So can you find maybe another type of equipment that they might have used to help find water on the moon.
        - Once you take a quick glance at it.
        - They could take it with them take it with them on a what
        -  Oh. Um water.
        - What does it say about the water in paragraph three
        - They can drink it, can we survive without water.
        - wow that's awesome and what kind of things, do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon, or the water, the frozen water.
        - So you're absolutely right. We can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own, which we use for what
        - What do we think of of what Jazmin just read so she said NASA send a small machine and what was the machine can anyone tell me.
        - Um, well, I talked about the polar craters because I said that they found a lot of water in the craters.
        - Take a look at the second paragraph of the article. What machine did NASA said that they use to discover the water?
        - When astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know, be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe.
        - Right okay yeah I wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself, I just I figured the astronauts were there with the machine.
        - they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water, since it was so small.
        - because one. We have a lot of water here on Earth. So why do we want water from the moon and to um
        - I highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water, but I didn't see discovering there. So I just, I found that found and water. And so that's how I use that. You know, I also want to tell you that I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too
        - OK, so let's look at the actual sentences, OK? So we've already talked about the microscope, but if you look at number two, it says NASA sent a small machine. Can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does?
        - Teacher : Did you hear the name of the equipment that they used this can go to anyone.
        - Microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it.
        - Yes, investigate. Alright, so what, what did they use to investigate.
        - Well, I thought that you know that they could, like, make them own garden, you know, and so they could grow vegetables and pinks
        - What else do we use water for that talks about in paragraph four,
        - No, I don't see anything in there either. So let's move on to our second one, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Maybe we can take a closer look at the reading to and get some other feedback.
        - Teacher : Right. So, let us look at things that are really small. So do you think we could look at the water that's really small.
        - And it was in what form.
        - So they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so I guess you did say that the they found craters full of water, and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits.
        - awesome Chris, do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope.
        - Yeah, exactly. So going back to what Luis said, the machine looks for ice deposits. So does anyone-        - can anyone understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for. Does everyone agree with that?
        - Well, let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon. So yes, astronauts do wear those as a protective measure. So when they're on the moon, they can survive because it's a really cool place. And if they didn't wear those they could die.
        - What did you just breathe in.
        - Oh, I guess, like, I guess I would have to say a piece of equipment.
        - Yeah I noticed that you didn't. You didn't mention any water.
        - Discovered yes yes now Farrah, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water. Later on they can study deeper
        - Okay, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool, called the microscope because the water was microscopic.
        - OK. OK. Explain my thinking. OK.
        - Great. So yeah, exactly. You're exactly right. And water is heavy. And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could
        - Yeah, and I think if we look back into our reading, we can find specifics 
        - um Okay, so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water.
        - Oxygen.
        - So I'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water. 
        - Why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two, and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that NASA sent.
        - So the word investigate means that in order to find something you have to investigate. Okay.
        - helped me look back, I'm looking at
        - When, when it says we're not able to see it.
        - Oh you're so well, what does that small machine do can anyone look at paragraph two, and tell me what is that small machine do.
        - Towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the.
        - So I gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like I gotta read the text.
        - So when you think of microscopic. What do you think
        - yeah that's great. in the text, they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really, really tiny.
        - Yes. And you're right. That was a detail from the text, but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used.
        - Okay, so um for the answer we just say both.
        - It can be water can be broken down into two parts. The hydrogen in the oxygen. Can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be
        - Cars it takes a while to build something like I have a whole like Lego house and ship and boat at my house and we're still working on it, because it takes a long time to build thing.
        - Yeah, I'm NASA did send a small machine. Do you remember what that small machine was called
        - Oh okay yeah I see Jazmin why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water. 
        - And, yeah. They might-Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you guys notice that?
        - Number three, paragraph three, the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water.
        - i'm not really sure I didn't really get that part about the Lunar orbiter. I guess I was still thinking about the microscope.
        - So like the Lunar Orbiter. OK.
        - I heard what Chris said, but I don't think he was right. I think, I think it was awesome. Chris said full of water, but
        - Yeah, they're using. I mean, they're using a bunch of
        - def. Can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote
        - A lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters. What were they looking for
        - that's right h2o does anyone know what he stands for.
        - We also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else. 
        - Luis, can you tell me about the lunar orbiter. Go back to paragraph two. Luis, you go ahead and look at paragraph two.
        - Do you know what they mean, you know what lunar means?
        - What does it do though? So what does the machine do?
        - it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so.
        - Yes, I love that you brought the grand Canyon because that's honestly how I picture the moon, sometimes, because the moon, is very dry dry place but, just like the grand Canyon.
        - And so you know, going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon, is that you know they actually.
        - Water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base, they might potentially build 
        - yeah yeah my family, we went up on a trip, we went to the grand Canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes, it was so hot and the sun was beating down, and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked.
        - ice deposits in lunar craters, but if it's too small to see with the eyes, they have to go in with that microscope to try to find.
        - Yes. And so, Oliver, did they send astronauts. Do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text.
        - We know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said. 
        - So you mentioned a small machine. Does anyone know what paragraph maybe that they named the small machine in?
        - So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use
        - No, no.
        - Okay, so are they saying, Is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used
        - Is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is.
        - Well, it says to investigate, so I guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means.
        - So if you use a microscope. Look at really small things. Why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon.
        - Right. And what machine. Did we identify that was used
        - And then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it, which means that it's really small.
        - um so I just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution, so much so thank you.
        - So there are these craters full of water on the moon and the scientists discovered it because they used to think there wasn't water but now they know that there is
        - i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and.
        - So, I guess, they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely.
        - Have a guess what is deposits are?
        - This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um anybody else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important.
        -  haha OK OK that's like the part Jazmin read that says scientists sent a small machine. 
        - You're not sure. Okay, well let's read the paragraph together again. Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small.
        - So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay. So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it. Okay.
        - Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water.
        - The sure do they sure do and all of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and I think that it's this part where it says they sent the Lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that.
        - Teacher : Yeah, so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things. So microscopic means it's really small, 
        - Well, so in in here, it talks about the water on the moon. 
        - yeah Thank you you're right yeah and then or better does anyone know what the word orbiter means or the orbit.
        - So, going back to the article, and now that we know about the microscope.
        - Well, they were looking for water on the moon. Right. 
        - Cuz it's right. But think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy
        - Yeah, okay. Okay, so I think I understand. I said, NASA sent a small machine. But I should have said, Like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right
        - If we know that first they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate and find those ice deposits, they found the water in those craters just like Chris said in his response.
        - We see that they used after the fact, after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like Farrah said,
        - It it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - So as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind
        - That means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth. 
        - But there's a situation there's something that they have to do, prior to that to where it's very broad, so your answer was was.
        - Okay, so your answer may not, that is not necessarily wrong, what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean, can you explain.
        - So Jazmin remember, we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon, but a microscope could be used for anything.
        - Exactly microscopic. That's one of the words that pops out to me. What does that mean, Farrah. Do you know?
        - I don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading I think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon, yes.
        - Um, yeah, I was just gonna say that, honestly, like I already know all about space. I don't think I need any help. I don't even think I should be in this
        - Oh, maybe like ice? That gets put down somewhere?
        - So yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon, they couldn't make like a gas station, so now it's time that could be important,
        - These craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope.
        - Perfect. So how, so we've identified the equipment. So I guess back to Farrahs question. How do they use this equipment to look and discover water. So which one do you want to focus on. First, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter?
        - Great so, can you tell me more about what the Lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing.
        - Yes, and Farrah I think you might know the answer to this, but what what did they use to look at the ice
        - And that's right and we saw that in, I believe, the third part of the--
        - I just read it, Jazmin. If you are listening.
        - We know that we have the Lunar Orbiter and that it's used to
        - yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon, but a tiny little machine did it for us, so we didn't have to send anybody up there, that makes sense.
        -  i'm having water on the moon, would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things.
        - Teacher : Would you like to reread the article?
        - And I can tell you that, because it tells you directly in the paragraph to.
        - I'm all right there says, and I was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater.
        - Yes, and that's where they found it. I think right?
        - Oh, ice deposit,  it's it's looking for ice deposit
        - I I looked at again. 
        - So cool machine can do it all, without any astronauts.
        - I think it was the one you had Chris read
        - Well, I mean, in my answer. I, I said a tool, uh, the microscope, because I use that to look at the water
        - To tell me what they think the main idea is for the main point of the first paragraph is
        - Yes, perfect. So then after they use the Lunar Orbiter. What did they use to look at the water?
        - awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water.
        - We use it for drinking. That was my answer.
        - And so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text. 
        - Okay, so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like.
        - Yes, so we're-        - we're going to look at-        - I want everyone to look at the machine it's referencing to. And I want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to.
        - Right, right. So we use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Um the microscope.
        - So when looking at the paragraph, um,
        - It's an NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small.
        - So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you guys want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?
        - NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater.
        - Very small. So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there. We also read in paragraph three. Yes Oliver. 
        - And so, has anyone here ever seen or used a microscope before.
        - yeah cool and how are you deaf did you, you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use.
        - My cup right here is 30 ounces
        - I don't have any questions but I did look at the clock and I see that it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Yeah, that makes sense.
        - What does it say right after that.
        - The microscope was used to look at the water, but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon, so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it.
        - Oh that's interesting, so we have equipment, both in Part Two and part three So what does that mean, how many pieces of equipment are we looking at.
        - um I don't know because, at first, I thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense I did I did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case, does anyone remember reading that.
        - Does anybody have that in the in the question, what was this equipment, helping them to do. Farrah yeah.
        - Where it says, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, so I mean like rocket fuel and the moon, I would that be by valuable. 
        - Great job. What does it investigate?
        - What is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter.
        - Go back and look at the text, so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says, you know future astronauts could drink this water, water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room.
        - So then, in paragraph three, what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water.
        - Oh, it set of eyes deposits were really small.
        - And is there a second part of that sentence that tells you maybe what it's called or like the name of an equipment.
        - Yes, it is. You're right. Yes. Breathing is very crucial. Great. So we can split the water. So with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important. Correct.
        - Okay, do you think it would be really cool to have a little waters on it and see that there's water in the moon from the story that we read
        - Perfect. Okay. And now I'll read the second sentence to you after you tell me what did NASA send to investigate. Can you tell me what that was called
        - It's very, very, very small. So we need to use that scientific tool called, like you said, a microscope to look at the water really closely.
- intent: r220.1
  examples: |
        - I am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response.
        - And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out. But we're not all quite there just yet. So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together. Sound like a plan?
        - So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer. 
        - We're all going to be in the group to learn together and discuss what we read
        - Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords. We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give.
        - Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text.
        - There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions. just to remind you what the questions are, i'll read them out loud for you guys. the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? 
        - The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this group is I want you to think what is this question asking. what what does it mean to circle evidence? 
        - Writing that is going to help us connect and learn
        - Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough. Okay? Do you know what thorough is?
        - However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material, I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills. So this really helpful.
        - Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you guys
        - Okay, so let's look back at Farrah answer real quick. We're going to go through each of your responses. 
        - but we're going to go over this question together because I think that all of us.
        - we want to really focus on what it says and our article today. we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon. 
        -  Does anyone know what I mean by using evidence from the text?
        - Okay we'll just work on question number one. thank you for letting me know. so did you guys will be time to write down your answers to questions?
        - I think these are all really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so.
        - Just to see what we can take away from our just our reading and then our discussion. So we're just in this all together, just looking at this little reading together.
        - In from the reading.
        - No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you guys got your answers from.
        - To get more specific with our response. 
        - information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff 
        - hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you all today. i'm excited to work with you on trying to Oliverelop really complete answers.
        - I know that you know all about space. But this isn't about learning about space. It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts. Does that makes sense? 
        - Is that everyone has different partial answers. And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers.
        - Great. Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon. You're talking about space.
        - But in a text. It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, all of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable.
        - Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this group so that we can focus on
        - We're just having a group discussion now that we've read
        - yeah we put them down on our tablets to you.
        - um excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Oh okay that makes sense.
        - However, we're working on a few different things in this group. We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given
        - Well I was kinda gonna say the same thing as Jazmin because I used equipment and my answer too.
        - Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this group. 
        - Yeah, I have a question. Um, I was wondering if um like, so my answer. Like, if we're all in the group to work together on getting the more correct answer. Like, I was wondering why my answer might be incorrect.
        - Good thing. So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about
        - You guys put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is
        - So let's talk a little bit more about what we can        - go ahead, Luis. 
        - And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills. So we're going to be learning but we're also        - about science
        - And I wanted to kind of dive into these here. I want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent. Oh yes, Luis.
        - Okay. Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort. Not just one person answering okay
        - Yeah, yeah, some great stuff. So we're, we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading. How do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need. So sometimes when I'm reading, there's so much information. I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for. 
        - Well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it.
        - And our question was what equipment was used to find that water. Now, Mr. Luis a lot of us found different types of equipment or we used background knowledge, but that's not exactly what the question was asking us to do. Okay, so can we look at deeper into that question. Is that okay, yeah.
        - are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you
        - Well, we're all in this together, we are just looking at this article closely together.
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.
        - A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small group is to kind of build off those responses. So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better. Does that make sense?
        - Um yeah, but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like Luis knows a lot about.
        - I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language.
        - extracting information from from informative text. So that's the main goal of what we're working on together. So I suppose I will start with
        - Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space. Luis But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon. Does that make sense.
        - Okay yeah Okay, I guess that's fine okay.
        - but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that y'all. Write down for your answers.
        - Um, how we answer the questions. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
        - And so in this case. That's what we're going to do. So let's take a look at your answers.
        - Um, yeah, so like here's something that's kind of on my mind. Like I know like a lot about space. And, um, I don't really think I need to be at this group, you know,
        - Okay. All right, great. So here's what we're gonna do, guys. So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text. Okay, so what was our question. Can someone read that for me.
        - So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question
        - I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more.
        - Well, hello. Okay, so I just heard all of your awesome responses. And I just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text. So I'm going to start. Yes. What's up, Luis.
        - that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills. Like I said to Luis earlier, we're not just working on our science skills, we're also working on our reading and writing skills 
        - All right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer. So remember the discussion question is-        - yes Luis?
        - Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I know all about space.
        - But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we all struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question. Okay.
        - Sets purpose for group
        - So, thank you. I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather all this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer. 
        - So I think so. Maybe you guys do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text.
        - Um, yeah. So here's the thing. I don't really think I need to be in this group, because I know all about space already so I don't really need any help with this stuff.
        - So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you guys an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for.
        - I want all of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text
        - Um, yeah. So I had kind of this question, like I already know like all about space. I know all this stuff. So I was kind of wondering like, I don't think I should be in this group.
        - So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer Luis.
        - And the timing starts now.
        - so we're all here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us, okay? so we're going to practice, these skills.
        - What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates
        - So the reason why we're looking back over your answers. And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon.
        - So we're going to be focusing on just this text, so that we can digest this and answer the question. So even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information, but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read
        - Okay, I got us into this group because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers 
        - But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills.
        - As you guys have done we're going to be using that reading 
        - Yeah. So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question. Who knows, have a strategy that we can use.
        - Oh. Yeah yeah. Ok. 
        - what we're doing today, why have you guys in a group is because we're trying to go even further we're going to
        - Because when we read informational texts. This year, you're going to need that skills. Okay.
        - Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today. You might find something that you didn't know
        - Asked me. I shouldn't be and that's great. I already know all about space.
        - I can stick around.
        - We asked that to answer and test a dependent question. 
        - But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you.
        - Better. Okay. I want. We want to see the process of how are we going to
        - Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do. It sounds good to you, Luis?
        - And so we had left of where we were trying to actually locate the answer from the passage. So we are going to just briefly recap that we were looking at the word. Yes. Luis
        - So Luis I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you guys to know is that.
        - Hey everybody, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer. Luis What's going on.
        - What excuse me.
        - The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you guys. 
        - So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text.
        - I said that, basically, as I said, that you need a small a tool called a microscope.
        - Well, thanks for sharing your responses to the second question guys I think again, we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses, using the text.
        - And look for those answers in the text 
        - Or we can strengthen your responses 
        - That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my class.
        - So I think you guys all did a really great job thinking while using our text. So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you. So, Farrah to start
        - So i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over, and so what I want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes Luis.
        - Because you're in this group doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done.
        - So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them. Yes Luis.
        - we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down.
        - And will also give personalized feedback during this process, and finally, we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response.
        - but we're going to focus on a elaborating our answers. Okay, okay, okay. Alright. So my concern is while you guys use your text to answer the question.
        - So today I want us to work on finding
        - Um, I just want to remind you, my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer.
        - Execuse me Ms. Teacher. I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - And we had some really great responses. So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text. 
        - Well, I hope you're right. But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question. So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good.
        - And the, the question. So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we all thought the answers were
        - I know I remember that. And based on your answer. I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us.
        - RER: Oh. Okay
        - So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you guys can better understand.
        - Okay, that sounds cool.
        - Hello, boys and girls. And what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy, then you are going to practice it in a small group and I will come back to talk a little more individually. If you still have some progress. Okay.
        - But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer. Okay.
        - So work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those. Okay?
        - Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does everybody remember.
        - Because we're not just. Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a group to kind of share our knowledge with each other. Okay.
        - And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have. Okay. I want. I just want you guys to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage. OK.
        - But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today Luis.
        - So what we can do is just kind of go around the room. If you just raise your hand. I'll call on you. And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work. So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you.
        - Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text. We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information.
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. So what is an ice deposit
        - The teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now.
        - I saw bits and pieces of that in there. So does anybody want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer.
        - so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space. But what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right? 
        - The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it.
        - tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you guys to use examples exactly from the text that way. I know that you guys had an easy time reading
        - Get more detail in there.
        - to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about.
        - Well, Luis. That's great. That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more.
        - For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text
        - We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions. So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses.
        - You may know all about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages. 
        - Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion.
        - Um okay.
        - Well, right now we're working on Olivereloping our responses. So even if you know a lot. It's about verbalizing what you know. So that's what we're practicing right now.
        - So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article. Now we got to read about something really cool. And I'm really excited to get to talk to you guys about it.
        - But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting. Okay.
        - and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions.
        - Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small group, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer. Yes Luis.
        - And who knows, maybe we could also teach you something as well right? Because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you guys, right? 
        - Thank you for joining me at the small group table, guys. I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about
        - So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers.
        - Okay. Well, that sounds. Okay. I guess I can hang around for that.
        - so then we can go forward and make sure that we're all on the same page about what, what did they use.
        - good to hear so today I put you on a group because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon.
        - Okay, so what I wanted to pull us back here about is because even though we might have a lot of information that we've learned in other places about space we were reading a text specifically on a mission and finding water on the moon. Correct?
        - Oh okay i'm still confused.
        - Um, yeah. So I just wanted to say. My dad is an astronaut. So I think that could be kind of helpful.
        - hi everyone so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - keywords in questions to help us better answer questions.
        - Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better.
        - Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the group can learn from.
        - Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer.
        - But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question.
        - So we just want to make sure that everybody is using the right language and everybody understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um Farrah you had your hand up well, I was.
        - And I want to make sure that everybody has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water. 
        - So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you guys about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage. Does that sound good to you guys. Yes. Luis
        - Trust me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further.
        - I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me. Can you read the discussion question for us. Again, Luis.
        - Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon.
        - Yeah, um, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space.
        - But you didn't write that for your answer. Either we all didn't write it for our answer. And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer.
        - Okay. Sounds good.
        - Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon.
        - You know what you think. I have learned that about you and it's something I value about you, but I want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks.
        - So then mine is good?
        - But we're all here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question, 
        - Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response. Can we do that.
        - Um, well, I mean I guess I don't, I  don't know. I don't really have anything to say about it. Like, I think it was like, I think in the in the in the text, it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water. Um, and like that made me think, like, that's you know what I mean, like, that was what they had to find
        - And how we work to break down questions and such um.
        - Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer. And we're going to hang out. I do like that you what you changed your answer to. And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer. We're going to help other people in this group use that same thought process. Okay.
        - and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon.
        - Fantastic. I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell all of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time. 
        - Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know all about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about. I didn't even know about water on the moon. So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff. I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it. So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this group.
        - I think we all have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text.
        - Excuse me. Um, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning.
        - I just pulled you all together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said. 
        -  One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to all of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes.
        - You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made all together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there.
        - each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts, and so, for pretty much everyone in this group i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers.
        - Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer. And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence. Okay.
        - I also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there.
        - Yeah, wonderful, buddy. But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions. So I want you all to look at question number two.
        - Well good. So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you all previous you read called water on the moon. And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So I've seend all responses, and I would like for you guys to use evidence from the text to support your answer.
        - Okay, okay, okay. I'll give it a try.
        - Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our
        - Okay, I guess, so.
        -  Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies.
        - It's good to see you too. Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers. Yes, Luis?
        - We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that everyone knows that you have a full understanding of the topic
        - Hey, so today we're going to do something super cool. We are going to be reading detectives. Okay, so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text. Okay Luis Do question.
        - Oh, oh, okay.
        - Okay, so Chris, do you want to change your answer or Luis you want to change your answer.
        - Well, we're gonna learn some more.
        - Okay, so let's all read read through it. I think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers.
        - That would be really cool. So Chris, we're working on reading informational texts. And the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts. I know that you know about space.
        - So for this group, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading. Does that sound good. Luis
        - Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space. And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that. So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more
        - Everyone had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects. So first before we share our answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question.
        - How-have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage. Awesome.
        - That can be true, however, today we're using science.
        - So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes Luis.
        - Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one group. And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your group discussion.
        - Okay well we're all put in this group to help each other learn, um, 
        - Great so I want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're all going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses.
        - yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but I got this all figured out now, so I think i'm all good.
        - Okay, yeah, I can stick around for that right
        - Hi, everyone. So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did everyone read? Yes, OK. So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding. So we're going to try to fix that today. So I want one-        - yes, Luis.
        - Very good. So we are going to talk about The tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer.
        - Yeah, I can stick around for that.
- intent: r230.1
  examples: |
        - I didn't really get at first that it was because.
        - Why do you think that?
        - Yeah, so
        - You could say, can you explain what you mean?
        - Well, you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water. that's a big deal.
        - Oh, that that's a good question. So okay, so my reasoning was basically that okay I agree that you need a scientific tool called a microscope like that's the equipment that the scientists use.
        - So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?
        - Now Luis your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used?
        -  I just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question. can you explain your thinking a little bit?
        - Oh yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter. We've been talking about it like this whole time.
        - Okay, Farrah. We're going to start with you. So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. How did you get to that answer?
        - Do you know what this machine is called?
        - Why not?
        - Wow, okay. So, ah, the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        -  yeah so I could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits.
        - Well, without oxygen tanks, they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die.
        - Why did you say equipment?
        - Mm hmm. Very good. Can you elaborate on that? Does it say what the name of the small machine is?
        - That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what? what do you think that would mean?
        - So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but this was really exciting. Thank you so much.
        - Discover. why did you pick the term discover?
        - No about the microscope.
        - Oliver What about for number two? how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment?
        - Can you explain what that means?
        - So, can you tell me a little bit more about your response?
        - That's a really interesting question. Like, I got to the answer, partially by listening carefully to Jazmin. And her answer and to our discussions together.
        - Yeah, I think, for the same reasons that Farrah, and I know because I know so much about space. I know there's so much equipment that you need and like you can't do anything without equipment. So it just seems like really important you know?
        - You do?
        - Because you need a microscope to look at things.
        - It means something that is small
        - Oh, that's a, that's a fair question. Um, but I found it on my own.
        -  um why isn't the microscope the right answer.
        - um well they say it's a machine, a small machine and machine can be equipment
        - This is my my first time because we we learned about the MARS Rover and, like the.
        - Well, it just kind of looked like the, you know, man. Like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine, you know, they said, like what equipment?
        - Why are you confused? And then we'll talk about the answer.
        - What were you looking for?
        - um I meant more like I have it figured out. like I can go back to my seat.
        - Did they use a microscope to find the water?
        - That scientists use oxygen tanks, while cuz I know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space.
        -  To breathe.
        - yeah Jazmin had the small machines Jazmin is that, where you were referring to.
        - Wow, what were you using it to find?
        - Why did you circle the last sentence?
        - Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools.
        - yeah so okay so survey and I said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I think that that group because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that I circled and I saw that the equipment that I noticed was the microscope.
        - And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer. Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Oh it's like and anything that space, you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks.
        - All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers Chris, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer.
        - Okay, so what is, what is that thing. What is it called
        - So i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said, even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you Luis I think you had a very interesting thought, but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question.
        - Tell me why.
        - yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it.
        - Well, I guess um I guess it was from my brain.
        - So, Oliver. I see that you said that you. I mean, you were all working in a small group which is great. You're using each other to help one another. But why did you circle, the same thing as Farrah. What did you fully understand this question. Do you need me to to re explain it. Why did you think it is a right answer? 
        - Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question.
        - I'm like, you know, you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that.
        - Okay um so Farrah can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer
        - know I think I was thinking that because the article says that it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money, so that means that you can't use it for a long time.
        - Yeah. And what led you that answer.
        - Okay, so I looked at the key words in the question and I thought the key word for equipment and discuss and when I looked at the reading. What I saw was that the microscope was something,
        - Will you tell me what what
        - Chris, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon. How did you come up with that answer
        - To look really closely is connected to discovering water.
        - Okay, so when part one, they say.
        - Do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile.
        - And how did you gather that information.
        - Farrah. How did you get to that answer.
        - Okay, Chris and you revised you're in. So you put that the water. Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that.  What made you change to change your answer.
        - um yeah okay so um when they found a water, well the ice actually was frozen water, it was ice. When they found is it was so small, it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it.
        - Okay, great Thank you so they've been Farrah what made you guys really focus on the microscope.
        - Can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine.
        - a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what.
        - So Oliver where were you getting that idea from because i'm.
        -  Well it's the same sentence I picked before.
        - Um, so I think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like,
        - So, with it being in the future. Oliver and Farrah, you mentioned that it's not ready. And no, not for a long time. Why do you think Farrah and Oliver that it's not valuable yet.
        - Okay, great. So what made you choose those two words.
        -  Do you know if it had
        - I mean all yeah cuz water, it's definitely important. So I guess if they could get to it, it would be. Yeah.
        - Oh yeah sure Okay, because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe, so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones.
        - yeah so Chris you're right Those are all great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer.
        - Either you can explain why did you circle that.
        - And so maybe your answer has one of these two parts, but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you Luis and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks That was really smart edition.
        - yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit, why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet.
        - Asks a follow-up question to help students elaborate on their response without an explicit reference to the text/question (e.g., "What do you mean by…")
        - Great and what made you write that answer, can you tell me a little bit little bit about that.
        - Say that we do have enough money. And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?
        - Oh. So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon.
        - Okay. And why not
        - Oliver and were you a person who said no. Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind.
        - Is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece.
        - i'm so Farrah your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz.
        - well, i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100% using oxygen tanks, while they go around discovering that water.
        - So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used
        - What would that be valuable.
        - yeah Okay, so in part three, they say, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it.
        - Oh exactly Luis so what made you think that the Lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two.
        - Okay. Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter.
        - Okay. And I want to ask you, do you know what we use a microscope for
        - Okay cuz I heard you tell him i'm Farrah and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question, like.
        - Um, okay. So basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it.
        - So why did you choose that.
        - Chris, you talk to me about water being heavy. Why did you choose to talk to me about that.
        - Well, cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer. Um, so you wanted to talk to us. So I feel like I kind of know everything.
        - Okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take, and how they don't have that time so i'm like well.
        - Well, because I was looking for the name of up the equipment. Um, and so I I only saw two things in the arm. The story but machine. I know his equipment.
        - and how do you know this.
        - Oliver, why did you circle. The same thing that Jazmin didn't
        - Yeah, so I don't understand why my answer's wrong.
        - And so basically I repeat visits as he like the question say like, what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be
        - yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it.
        - A more specific name.
        - That's okay. Jazmin, absolutely you can. You could give me one moment, Jazmin, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on.
        - i'm looking at the story now, so I can see it, it says NASA small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before. Do you know that phrase.
        - hmm that's so what, why is that such an important thing.
        - Um, yeah, yeah. So I was seeking about oxygen tanks, because, like, well, okay, so I was seeing whenever I see like movies with astronauts or whenever I think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever. I think like the astronauts would have to have
        - Can I ask you why, if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer.
        - You know, I think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful, but I think
        - So why did you say they use microscopes.
        - But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and Oliver on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence. So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable.
        - Because, in the first instance I only said that well I said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water, like you, like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the Lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, so that was evidence you got from your own experience.
        - How can you come up with this answer?
        - Oliver. Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as Farrah. So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer.
        - Well, it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and
        - yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits. What do they look like?
        - Can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to.
        - Okay, so it sounds like, where did you learn that fact.
        - So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that.
        - Well, I think it means that you can't just like think of something on your own, but you have to read what's in the story. 
        - Um, yeah. So basically, like I circled the same thing, like in the paragraph three, where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh, they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms.
        - yeah, and so I also want to circle back to Jazmin because Jazmin I think that you circled right away that NASA sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water.
        - Yeah, I would love to. Unfortunately we do have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to share with you.
        -  um the answer is the Lunar orbiter.
        - Um, so the reason that I mentioned it was because I know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use, like, stuff like that, in order to walk around.
        - Okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like I told you, they can't breathe in space so that's valuable.
        - It helps you look at stuff.
        - Okay, because, well, you know, like we need water to drink. Um, and I feel like I read it in my book I read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink.
        - So it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really, really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope.
        - Okay, why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this group, because you don't know you already know about space.
        - Um, well, I saw the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water. And so I found it in paragraph three
        - Okay, what do you mean by that.
        - Okay um So could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the Lunar orbiter.
        - Can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer.
        - yeah cuz Well, we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like.
        - What made you choose the word microscope. What made you choose that word.
        - Like you have to use equipment. If you're going into space. And I guess I guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that, you know what I mean
        - Excellent. And what did you did you work with your partner just now.
        - awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine.
        -  yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning, paragraph one, it says um well, let me find it Okay, it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.
        - and why.
        - Well cause when you asked everybody to say their answers and Farrah said hers, and I realized that she had the same thing that I had, I talked about the microscope and the story, the part where it says that they
        - Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more. I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head.
        - I'll pass that says I just kind of take a long time.
        - Farrah I think your answer is quite interesting, can you explain a little bit?
        - How did you guys arrive that you're thinking
        - Did they find it in the crater.
        - Well, because if Luis's right, then that will mean that i'm wrong, but I think that I think that I, I came up with a good answer, based on the text too.
        - And what made you pick this particular sentence Jazmin.
        - Because because that's what i'm Jazmin had and what Farrah had, and you, you told them that was correct.
        - Yeah. Well, if there's water.
        - yeah, so why do you think that scientists at NASA might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon.
        - Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that
        - Well Okay, they said the waters microscopic on So how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope.
        - What do you believe it means
        - when you read that question did you circle key words or underline things What was your strategy there.
        - How much?
        - yeah so okay in part three, it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow Scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that.
        - Because they talk about the water and they said, like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water.
        - That is absolutely correct. And does anyone know. Can someone tell me what discover means?
        - Well, can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article?
        - Oh, okay, here it is. Um, so they need oxygen. The astronauts need oxygen.
        - Yeah. We know that the moon is dry. Okay, I get it.
        - yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, can you tell me more about this.
        - And why do you think that's an important part of the question.
        - run, one by one i'm going to ask each of you a question, which is what made you say that.
        - All right, Luis actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that.
        - Well, let's look at what made you think of that.
        - Can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter Lunar Orbiter.
        - um yeah yeah, I can tell you Oh, you know what while he's looking did you I went to NASA and I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and.
        - Um, we were looking at DNA, like we did a, like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like DNA cells. It was really interesting.
        - Luis, why do you think that's the right answer.
        - Well, because I got some little story. They say you need the Lunar Orbiter to investigate like Jazmin and Luis set, but I guess. Also, I mean if the water so small. Like Farrah and Oliver said, then you need a microscope, because how can you, how can you discover it. If you can't see it.
        - um yeah cuz I was looking for all of the key words in the question, like how you said.
        - Okay, and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks.
        - Um, well, like, I don't know. Like, what if, like, it's not really in the reading. But like you could look at germs and stuff.
        - On cars. Well, though the question asked about equipment and so I was looking for, like, an equipment and and I saw the microscope, and I know that that's equipment. Of course, we use it in science class.
        - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I just didn't really know what to like what to circle I just figured. Yeah, but I know in the lunar orbiter is
        -  So what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading?
        - Oh, they found it in the craters that were full of water.
        -  and do you think Jazmin, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking.
        - And how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon.
        - Oliver. What made you say that it's not ready yet?
        - What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure.
        - Yeah, yeah
        - Yeah, jazz Jazmin's answer was right. But do you know why that is.
        - You want to explain that?
        - Can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists?
        - OK, and Oliver why did you, why did you put down the same thing in Farrah was your mind going the same way as hers?
        - Okay, Farrah. Why did you circle equipment.
        - um Okay, a couple of reasons, one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so I know that they do that, and then, when I was reading the story in paragraph three, is the last sentence, it says.
        - Oh well, if said they used it to what was the word investigate.
        -  and why does that make it valuable. What's your thinking there. 
        - yeah I looked more at the word discover.
        - Because, well, um
        - Um, oh okay I'm oxygen and hydrogen could be used as rocket fuel.
        - um I have something to say.
        - Okay yeah that's all right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement, for me, certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon, but could you just clarify why you provided that response.
        - Yeah, they're astronauts
        - Well, Luis if you already know a lot about space. Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did.
        - Jazmin, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated. Right. And why do you think that. Why is that true?
        - Tell me more, why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon.
        - And explain to your partner. Why you found that answer.
        - I think we need to come up with reasons why the water would be like important. That's another meaning for valuable.
        - And Chris, do you want to, in the meantime, while Farrah and Luis reread the text, do you want to Talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon?
        - Yes, they did.
        - Perfect So what have you figured out.
        - It's not that I liked her answer, you know, it's like like I had the same answer as her or like she had the same answer as me. You know, like we had the same answer, but it doesn't like like I had her answer, you know,
        - Yeah. So I said, NASA sent a small machine, and I, I don't understand why that's wrong.
        - and Jazmin. So you specified that they use small machines. Why did you, why did you look for. Why did you say that they use small machines.
        - um okay cuz you know, like accident, we gotta breathe man, we need oxygen to breathe, so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die.
        - Well, how can you discover something if it's too small to see
        - I'm, um, I don't know. Cuz I feel like they. It doesn't say that there were astronauts. But how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts.
        - yeah so thank you for sharing that Chris so let's take a look at discover, so why did you circle discover.
        - But I want you to think about what made your mind think that
        - And Luis did your background knowledge help you, with your answer to the question I see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that did you think about that from your background knowledge.
        - Well, cuz i i know a lot about space, you know i i watched some TV shows. And sometimes I'll watch Nova on YouTube.
        - Oh that's a good question um I read it online.
        - Um, yeah. So basically what I was thinking about was that, um, you know, like that the microscope was was the tool. And the reason why I thought that, and I think it's like
        - Okay guys she said it's equipment I looked at paragraph six, and it does talk about water on the moon so it's got all the key things.
        - On what you meant by that.
        - What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there. So I'd like to start with Farrah. So let's hear your answer. And how do you think you got to that answer.
        - Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read?
        - But when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there.
        - Reach Every Reader:Well I was looking at the at the text. And I thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment. And so I was looking for some things that was equipment. And then the question also asked about water. And so I saw in paragraph three, that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope, which is equipment.
        - Or how did you come to that conclusion.
        - Well, excuse me. This is Luis I should
        - Why do you think equipment is the most important word
        - um yeah so I said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because if they're scientists up on the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure.
        - So, Luis, the water can be. You said that water can be split into two parts. Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts.
        - Oh yeah let me look okay in the story, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Water now Chris. Why do you think water is the most important question or word
        - Okay did the scientists found the moon, I mean water in the moon?
        - yeah you're right they use tons of equipment, like the ones that you mentioned, and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon, can I ask you what makes you say that.
        - Why did you choose that.
        - Well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature, I don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon.
        - yeah so Okay, so my initial answer when I didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but then after we work together and I actually looked at the reading, and all this stuff I said okay scientists found ice using a small machine.
        - yeah I kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until I was looking in but text for everywhere, they said equipment.
        - So Chris. Did you read our passage
        - Why is that important.
        - Can you list off some equipment that they used
        - Um, so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely, like if if something's really small, then you like look at it that way.
        - Hello. So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Um, Farrah, how did you come up with your answer.
        - Okay, awesome. So you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this
        - yeah so I was thinking when I was reading when I was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when I watched like space shows on TV they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that, so it seems weird that they left that out.
        - What did you change your answer to Jazmin.
        - I was thinking, looking at the meeting because I made sure to look this up and I said, like they said, I'm
        - What do you say that
        - Can you explain a little bit more. Why you circle that
        - So, how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question.
        - Well, I know that the question was asking for water. And I know that we have to find equipment. So I was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water.
        - Why did you do that.
        - Oh yes, okay well it's it's right there in part two, and it says that NASA send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits, and I think that means that that's how they found the water.
        - Okay, let's take a look at your answer. So you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and Farrah. Can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely. What do you mean, what are they looking closely at
        - Because that.
        - Okay, that's great. That's a great you know comment I would ask you, what, what do you think your question. What do you think the question is asking you.
        - Yeah. So what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for
        - Very good. And what made you think about the craters on the moon.
        - Farrah and Oliver you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer.
        - Okay, so what's confusing you Jazmin. Let's see.
        - All right, Jazmin, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine.
        - So that's one thing that they used. And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?
        - yeah well, I said that scientists use oxygen tanks. 
        - She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small. Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water. Yes, Oliver?
        - Discover because they were asking like you know what I mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water
        - Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer.
        - yeah I can say that, so, well it's right there in the text, and I know we have to find something in the text and well, that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question.
        - What are you confused about Jazmin.
        - Yeah, absolutely. So I, I wish I could unfortunately because you have to go
        - Luis Can you explain to me how you came to your answer.
        - um I mean, I guess, he was pretty similar yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen so I want to understand how this is going to be valuable.
        - Why did you write down the answer that you did.
        - Wondering about that. In what way.
        - So what is confusing to you about that.
        - Well, I guess I think I got it from the last part of the of the story. Part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money. So it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today.
        - Because it's so small.
        - It's called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - How did you come up with your answer. Farrah.
        - Alright so Oliver. Will you explain your answer for me?
        - Okay, because you know I mean I already know that they found water on the moon, I already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good.
        - Okay, what are you confused about Jazmin.
        - Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is Farrah, can you tell me why you put that answer as well.
        - whoa Okay, why are they definitely using oxygen tanks.
        - um yeah so I was looking for the
        - when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it. Does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it.
        - Oh, yeah. Yeah, it'd be good, so that they could drink it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that sounds good.
        - On what.
        - Yeah, I can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water. And so, and a microscope is basically a scientific tool, but the scientific tools also equipment.
        - Excuse me. I shouldn't be in this group, I already corrected my answer. And so I know mind correct now.
        - Just because they use that word in the sentence. They say they say NASA sent a small machine. So I was just, I was using that word because it was in the story.
        - Um, yeah. So basically, um, okay. So where I found my answer was the same place that Farrah did in paragraph three
        - Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine.
        - Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the group. Like, how did you come up with your answer.
        - Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting. Aside from the question itself.
        - What background knowledge do you want to add to your answer? Did you read your answer?
        - yeah so I was thinking that basically like Okay, so it says what equipment did the scientists right.
        - let's see I could say NASA sent a small machine and it found water but it's really, really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth.
        - Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?
        - Maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't really read the text very much because I kind of knew about space.
        - It was actually Okay, so I knew in the first and, today, I said that the scientists sentence small machine but I realized that I looked up the name of the machine
        - Oh, okay. So, why, why do you think the microscope is the correct answer.
        - All right, is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope?
        - Well, they may say.
        - Um, I know that does sound funny. So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope.
        - Yeah, how did you come up with that answer. Can you share with your, your students Farrah.
        - What made your mind, find that answer.
        - Yeah yeah cuz you need to drink.
        - Why did you circle the same as Farrah?
        - What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon.
        - Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Did you understand you answer?
        - Hydrogen and oxygen.
        - What is it you know about space.
        - So they talk about the microscope in, in part, in part three. And they say, the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it. If you didn't have a microscope.
        - Well yeah I mean cuz I thought that I answered the question you know where it said, could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story, it asks do you think it would be a good investment, and so I said no, so I don't I don't understand why that's wrong.
        - and, why did you circle the same as Farrah?
        - I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger. Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else.
        - Okay, well, so the text is. It's called water on the moon. And so I figured the answer should be about the water on the moon. And they found it in the craters like these critters full over water.
        - Well, does it pertain to our article?
        - You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time. So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time. Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?
        - yeah so you you clarified response, which is, which is great what helped you find the title of.
        - All right, Chris. So you talked about
        - Yeah, I think so. I'm like, I think that I could see like Oliver and Farrah, said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer.
        - Ah, well it's a story and I mean the stories about water on the moon. So, um, oh yeah, yeah, it says it in the second sentence, but it will land at the moon. Yeah.
        - Luis What are you thinking
        - Because I know that I'm TO GO TO THE MON astronauts have to use oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe on the moon without it.
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer.
        - Okay, so, um, let's see, in paragraph three, they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Chris. Let's look at yours. You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon. Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer.
        - Okay, I'm going to start with Farrah Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah.
        - and I want to go to, why do you think the craters are full of water on the moon.
        - yeah it's like yeah I think that's why water is valuable.
        - And Farrah then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah. Will you tell me where you found your answer.
        - mm hmm that's right and Farrah you are, you are thinking, the same thing right.
        - It's not wrong at all. I would just like to hear a little bit more detail. I want to know a lot more of what you know about it. So tell me about the machine.
        - So they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the, the really small water with the microscope.
        - Yeah. Yeah, it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass. But it's like you look at smaller things
        - Okay, Justin. Why did you underline discover
        - Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident.
        - How did you know that water's heavy
        - Um, so yeah, I basically did the same thing as Farrah. I looked at the same paragraph and it said that, um,
        - Yes. Yeah, so that was my answer. Yeah.
        - What made you say that.
        - Okay, so here's what I thought was I was looking for equipment right because it said what equipment did the.
        - that's awesome Farrah, can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope.
        - Well, because we've been talking about equipment.
        - circle.on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on, and if you see something you can discover it so that's why I picked a microscope because, being able to see tiny particles, but overall.
        - Perfect, great. Jazmin, I see that you were talking about a small machine. Is that the machine you were talking about?
        - Well, you don't use them for discovering you just use them for breathing.
        - So you said that they had sent a small machine. Did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon.
        - It does need to be a thing, and what made you say that.
        - yeah well, so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe.
        - yeah well, you told us to look in paragraph two, but what about paragraph three and the microscope.
        - I'm like, I'm like, I'm kind of thinking that, like, I understand. I gotta look at the paragraph, so I gotta see. So if I look at it after I looked at it and listen to Jazmin's answer like
        -  Well, I said because there's a sentence at the beginning of Part two that says that. 
        - And I will, because I know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read.
        - Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water.
        - yeah I was looking for.
        - Maybe, starting with Luis Luis could you explain how you came to your answer choice.
        - The answer. I mean, I use. I said, I'm not too small machine, but I'm in this group. So why is my answer.
        - I was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying, okay, so there's ice deposits in the polar crater.
        - What are you confused about.
        - Okay so Farrah, they do use microscopes right?
        - So did you find that on your own prior to Farrah writing that or did you kind of just copy that?
        - um so I didn't really need to read it, because I already knew the answer, because I know a lot about space, so I knew already that that scientists had to use that.
        - You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice 
        - OK. OK, I don't remember. NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. OK, so it's a small machine and it's called a Lunar Orbiter and it investigates.
        - I really so good good all right now so have you heard about this story before, or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah.
        - Alright, so NASA sent a small machine so, can you tell me why did you say that.
        - Okay, I was looking for equipment and I know that a machine is equipment and that in that paragraph, they were talking about. Why did I say that?
        - What it says, then you start to investigate. That's the word they use in paragraph two.
        - yeah i'm cause I was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph, they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters.
        - What else was the article about Farrah.
        - Mm hmm. So that would be good. What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water
        - Why is that your answer?
        - And it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway.
        - The whole the whole story is called water on the moon, so.
        - Can you tell me more?
        - yeah yeah I found it there, too, because you can't find something if you can't see it, you need the microscope.
        - Yeah yeah I had the same answer that Farrah did, that  they were asking about finding water and I'm paragraph three talks about finding water.
        - I mean, yeah. Cuz, cuz you know water is valuable. Yeah, okay. Water is valuable.
        - Well, because that's sort of like the action, like what they did.
        - Yeah. So let's talk about that just a little bit. So what made you choose that as your answer.
        - I see a lot of good thinking. And Farrah, I really loved how you dug in the text. And Oliver. It looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as Farrah, you circled the same thing. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion?
        - Farrah was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different.
        - Um, cuz well we we got the answer sheet. And so I know our answers didn't all get 100 on them. And so that's why we got pulled into this group. And so the teacher told us that was the answer.
        - For a couple of you guys so deb could you go more in depth with your answer, I know you did circle, the same as Farrah, but I want to know why you did, or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah.
        - Okay cause on the thing that Jazmin said about drinking it. I mean, like everybody needs to drink water. And then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space.
        - Oh yeah, having more room would be valuable.
        - Well, because it says it in the story, it says that um let me see where was that.
        - What was your reason
        - i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you guys had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice.
        - because that was the action.
        - um so what I was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks.
        - What were those two parts that you said
        - Farrah do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house.
        - Why wouldn't it make sense?
        - Wow, I mean you that that's okay. So I saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important.
        - So um what makes you think that your answers wrong.
        - Okay, well, um, it said a piece of equipment and a microscope is equipment and you need it to look at the water
        -  Okay, well, I found it on Oliver in part three, and I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I guess I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon.
        - Okay i'm Jazmin Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking.
        - I was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and I don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why I was saying to you need the microscope.
        - Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life. So you and Luis kind of have similar responses. So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that.
        - um yeah. Okay, so when they found the water um well actually what I use, and it was really, really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes, they had to see with the microscope.
        - Well, cuz I found a different answer. And so if if they're right that it could be valuable. But what the story says that I'm
        - So that is true. It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that.
        -  so um Luis you were talking about the parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen, why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable?
        - That they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home.
        - Discover. All right. And why did you circle discover
        -  I understand the Lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense, but I still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover.
        - guys, we are all different people with different ideas I mean I shouldn't even be in this group I already know all about space.
        - If we can refill up on the moon.What do you think that would mean
        - Well I guess the right answer cuz I thought that I had the right answer because I found it in the text, you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story.
        - I guess, similarly to what it is that I was looking for something that was like equipment and and I was also looking for where they would like discover the water and so that was a piece of equipment.
        - Can you tell me a little bit more about that.
        - And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?
        - Um, yeah. Well actually it's a really good question. I think that why like here's my thinking on this like
        - Well, first, Luis, before I became um what made you think that was the correct answer. When you read the question what relied talk me through it.
        - Yeah okay so they use like they use oxygen tanks and they use masks and like, they must have us rocket fuel and like rocket ships and all that kind of stuff, you know,
        - I'm not really sure. Like I feel like I guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and I know that, like we're we're working on the small group. So we can we can kind of get the right answer, but I'm not really sure why my answer is wrong.
        - Is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation.
        - Could you describe more this machine that they use.
        - Um, so I was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water.
        - Can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that.
        - Okay, so my answer was the NASA scientists small machine and I noticed that in the reading.
        - Luis I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut. I'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer. I like
        - Why do you think valuable, tell me more, please.
        - I saw where Farrah. Where you revised your answer. what made you change your mind. What made you change your answer.
        - Yes. So why is that valuable.
        - That's really cool, I love that. Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at all when you were at NASA?
        - In the passage. Yes. What does the word what what was a microscope used to do.
        - your thought process was for answering that. 
        - What do you know about microscopes.
        - Farrah, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did.
        - Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine.
        - Well, okay, so you know how they were saying in the reading, kind of like what I've said like they need like all this
        - You didn't find that in the reading. Is that what you said.
        - What was your what.
        - Um, yeah. So basically, Farrah, and I both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water
        - Like the water. First off, like the water is ice. So you know what I mean, like, you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing. They said like later on in it. They talked about how
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so I was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, you know, cuz they can't breathe on the moon. And so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do
        - Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - Okay, so I read the story and I looked for the evidence and I pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain.
        - Yeah, like I know they use it but like it wasn't in the reading when i when i read. I was wondering, like, should it have been there. You know what I mean.
        - So, Oliver, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome. Can you tell me what that means.
        - Still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now Farrah.
        - I think your answer is very close to what we're looking for, but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope 
        - Okay, so it is an equipment. What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?
        - Why do you say that
        - Um, synonym?
        - What won't be ready.
        - So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it.
        - That's interesting because I was thinking about crater. So you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well. 
        - Okay, so, um, Miss Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. What do you know about a microscope.
        - Okay, awesome. Farrah. And what made you say that
        - um yeah so I mean their interests are pretty good, but I was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon, they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time, which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it.
        - Oh, the cost part.
        - I added the name of the machine. I said NASA some to small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - So why did you guys think that what was your opinion about that. Well,
        - But while I do that I was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer. Think in your brain. What made you answer that. 
        - Oh well. So I think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water, which was pretty cool.
        - Um, I understand what you're saying. Cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer, but I had the same answer. Also Farrah and I guess I'm just not sure, like how I would know that my answer is wrong, without without you telling us it's the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Okay. So Oliver, I see that you just answered the same as Farrah. Did you read the article.
        - On because it's like one of the.
        - i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer.
        - Actually, I just looked at the clock.
        - Yeah, sure. Cuz question was asking, you know them, finding the water like like how Oliver said, so I was looking at the text.
        - yeah I was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph, and when I saw machine I know that's like equipment and this one's talking about.
        - I thought that, um, I thought that's what they said.
        - Oh, I think maybe I'm that
        - Well, I can share um Okay, so I was thinking you know um first off.
        - Okay, because it's like when it's asking like what equipment, the teacher says, right after the the question if it says why did blah blah blah, what did blah blah blah, then the blah blah blah, whatever the (unitelligle) is, is the important one.
        - The question was asking about equipment and so I was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope. I know his equipment and also I was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph, they talk about the microscope.
        - I don't know but but it says, tt says that they put they had a microscope in the story.
        - I was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that, um, that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like
        - Because, in the first paragraph, it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and I know deep means like a lot of water, because when I go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water.
        - Well, I think I, I think I answered the question. This time, and I added more detail to my answer.
        - Well, what I mean. Cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Good job. Oliver, what made you come up with your answer choice.
        - And I've looked over your answers. Luis, what was your answer again, and why do you think that's a good answer? What's--
        - So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as Farrah. How come you do that.
        - I picked it because, well, I found it in part three in part three, they say, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So what makes you think.
        - They you said they're not ready yet. Why did you say they're not ready yet.
        - Do you remember what that machine was
        - Okay, um. Now what did they say the microscope was used for
        -  So there's no people it's just the machine.
        - Okay well well, what did you figure out a bit curious to hear.
        - Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?
        - Like lots of things.
        - Oh well, cuz okay so I actually knew already because, um, well I guess they said it in the reading, but they but like I knew that because I visited NASA and I know all about NASA. And I could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship.
        - Um, well, I guess the waters, not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading. You have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question. It's like microscopic
        - I just was wondering, so you said no, not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well, I don't.
        - Did you work with Farrah on the question.
        - Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?
        - And then if you look at Jazmin's answer. It says, NASA send a small machine. What was the name of that small machine.
        - That was a great answer so Oliver you circle, the same as Farrah what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used.
        -  Chris, what do you have to say about your answer.
        - I can't remember, it sounds pretty cool.
        - I read that you have the same answer Farrah What was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason.
        - yeah sure I have the same answer as her because I I think it's the microscope.
        - Oliver, why did you say that this this does answer the question.
        - Well, I was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water, and in paragraph three, they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope.
        - yeah um and so I know about my answers right because I already know about space and I don't need your help.
        - Really, so do you think they could use the Lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah.
        -  Well, my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time.
        - All right. And what do you have figured out
        - Oh well, so.
        - Can anyone tell me how it feels, answering these opinion questions.
        - Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that.
        - Yes, so I was thinking.
        - Okay, why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true, that it can be broken down into two parts. But if we read on, and we get the complete idea if we finish the, the thought in the text and we keep reading. We may learn why that's important. Why does that make it valuable.
        - yeah tell me why you why you said that.
        - Can you add any other details.
        - Um I circled equipment, because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment Did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment.
        - i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set I got it.
        - Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title.
        - awesome great great great so um is Farrah said, is that the reason why you chose the same answer.
        - yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like.
        - What can you tell me about your answer.
        - i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house.
        - Okay, so we're still thinking about that microscope right? What makes you think that they want to use a microscope?
        - Oh well, typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank.
        - Can I just ask you what made you say that.
        - Well, because.
        - why, why did you say that?
        - How could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters. Okay, so I said it was heavy
        - would be, can you tell me more about this small machine
        - Okay, very good. You said no because not not for a long time. Why did you say not for a long time.
        - yeah so I read in the story that NASA send a small machine.
        - Oh well 
        - I'm like in the reading?
        - Okay. Do you know what a microscope is
        - Oh well, kinda cuz yeah I'm in the same science classes her so when it said scientific tool. I was thinking about how we use tools for different things. And so I thought, equipment and tool was the same thing. So that's why I set the microscope.
        - yeah cuz, I guess, I was just trying, I was listening to what you said to Oliver.
        - Not for a long time, why do you think not, for a long time.
        - Um, so, like, I'm kind of just, I'm kind of thinking
        - So it's in. It's in paragraph three
        - Well, like it wasn't in the in the meeting, but I was thinking like they had to use it, you know, so like I was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment.
        - Okay, so I know about space, and I know that they can't breathe up in space and like Chris said, you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use. 
        - Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope.
        - Yeah, so, um, I said that because on in paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out.
        -  Well, actually i'm i'm still kind of confused.
        - Ah, um
        -   The questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question.
        - and Oliver so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as Farrah?
        - All right, thank you so i'm curious, so why did you decide to circle equipment?
        - And Jazmin. Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question.
        - On the directions, or something else.
        - Okay well in part three, it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope.
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so, um, I said no. It's not ready yet because. Last paragraph, they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money. So it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon. Yeah.
        - What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it.
        - Okay okay that part I did see somewhere in this store.
        - Well, if there's astronauts on the moon. They need oxygen tanks.
        - Farrah, can you tell me do you want to read out your answer, maybe we can all decide as a group, we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so Can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that.
        - Okay, because I I get it now that i'm supposed to like you know.
        - Yes, Okay, so you asked me what the name of it was in so I see that the name of the machine is the Lunar orbiter and but then I guess I don't know like do I just have to add that, to my answer, I guess, I don't know what when i'm supposed to write for my answer.
        - But if they could get to it. And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it. What do you think
        - Yeah, sure. Um, they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more, because I know like a lot more machines too
        - Where is it.
        - Alright, everyone thanks for sharing your responses with the group i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers, and I have a question to you, why do you think we each have different answers.
        - Oh, and why do they need the oxygen tank.
        - So Farrah. What made you change your answer?
        - RER: I know a lot about space, astronauts can't breathe up there. So boom oxygen tanks. 
        - yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you.
        - Sure sure Okay, let me look at what I circled in a story.
        - Luis why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said.
        - What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that Luis?
        - And I said the who
        - and also how was your answer answering the question 
        - Oh yeah, I mean, I mean, we both just thought, if the same answer. I mean, so I thought the microscope and she thought our microscope. Um, yeah.
        - Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？
        - Oh man, I know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like, you know what I mean, like, all kinds of stuff.
        - Tell me a little bit more about that 
        - um, can I say something that is Luis over here.
        - Because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable, or not.
        - Okay, so, Farrah. You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. Did you understand
        - Okay. What are you
        - Excellent. Why would a microscope, help us see the water
        - yeah what are you confused about telling me.
        - Alright, so our question is, why did you choose to write that response so starting now i'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think about that.
        - Yeah, so I, my answer was, in paragraph three, and I said on that said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So you need the the microscope to see the water
        - Okay, well in the last paragraph. It says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money. So it sounds like that. They don't have the money and it'll take a long time. 
        -  yeah well actually I was just gonna say that I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - So thank you for sharing. I'm happy that you work with Farrah. Did you get any answer independently.
        - Could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon, and why they're looking for water on the moon?
        - Well okay.
        - was looking for the keywords like how you said to Jazmin you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph, I saw that it was also talking about water on the moon.
        - Um, yeah. Okay, so basically the microscope.
        - yeah and why did, why did NASA astronauts need all those things.
        - Can you elaborate on that response.
        - Because that's what they used to look for water.
        - Chris. What are you thinking
        - Okay perfect Thank you alright Jazmin let's go on to you, so you said that NASA sent a small machine So why did you choose to write about small machine, can you tell me a little bit about that.
        - Well, I said it's not ready yet, because the same thing on Okay, at the end of the story, it says scientists need to come up with a plan.
        - Well, all because that was in the
        - um well, I was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it, and what I was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water, and I was saying, well, actually, it was when I had to go back you I saw that it was just a little bit of water.
        -  But sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so Luis if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question, can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain, because you knew all about space.
        - Good and how did you come to that conclusion.
        - Okay, so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter, but I also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter, could you please tell me how you come up with that answer.
        - Okay, and can you tell me a little bit more why you.
        - Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer. What made that microscope stick out to you.
        - Well, they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk. I'm not sure what other equipment they need.
        - The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the.
        - When it said that the water was deep in the craters that that meant was like a poll that was really deep in there was a lot of water.
        - yeah right and but seeing Luis, you said you know so much about space, I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you, right after Luis okay.
        - Um, because it's like the first noun in the question.
        - awesome So what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly.
        - um yeah because if.
        - Okay, so I Luis so you think are you know a lot about space. So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this group, though.
        - And okay so NASA such a small machine and and.
        - In the story at the end of the story, they talked about how.
        - They need a small machine. Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine.
        - it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking.
        - Um, yeah. So like, you know, like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Um, yeah, I can totally do that. So I circled the same things as Farrah.
        - Okay, what does a microscope look for? how do you use it.
        - So I was thinking when I was looking at it that well. Okay. So I was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship.
        - Like, I mean, that's what I mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope, because I don't think there were any astronauts there.
        - That-you did discover that they use oxygen tanks. That was really good. However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?
        - Chris and I just sorry or Sir, could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me.
        - What do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable.
        - Okay. A lot of it was just like what was really interesting is that like with water. You could do like so much magic stuff plant and you do all kinds of stuff with water.
        - yeah so I don't understand why our answer is wrong.
        - And why is that a big deal. How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - So I saw responses and Oliver. My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is Farrah. So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me.
        - Oh great so Oliver do you want to tell me why you decided to circle equipment.
        - Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
        - Well, I mean I I read a lot of stuff about space and I watch Nova on PBS so yeah like I have a lot of prior knowledge about this already.
        - Thank you so much for staying um Oliver I read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that.
        - Okay, Chris. So what made you. What made you choose this answer.
        - i'm wondering if maybe they would just leave some stuff there so that they can keep building up a whole piece there and then they can leave their their tools and equipment on the moon.
        - because  they used both of them to find the water.
        - Yeah, definitely.
        - What did you find important about the small machine.
        - Right. So did you say you have a new answer.
        - Right. And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?
        - What do you think
        - yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the key word so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon, and so that's how I found it in the first paragraph.
        - Right Okay, so how did you find that out because I didn't see that in the text, so how to use that.
        - yeah so well, I was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it, you need to see it to discover.
        - So, in your answer, why did you choose that.
        - Okay, what are you confused about?
        - I'm teacher. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for taking my time to work with us.
        - Equipment water. Okay, why did you circle equipment.
        - Well, because if if he got the right answer. Then I thought that I had the right answer.
        - I feel you have a great evidence, can you tell me more about this machine?
        - So I was thinking about like what equipment like I know about microscopes from like science class. And so I was thinking like, you know, if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope, you know what I mean?
        - Well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon, we need some food and sustainable food.
        - Yeah. Okay, so in paragraph two, in the first sentence, it says a NASA sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate.
        - Well, I knew it already.
        - Okay, so it lands where?
        - Awesome. What is the microscope D.
        -  I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and Luis raise their hand for the lunar orbiter. Could you explain to the group, one of you, why you think that is what it was called?
        - So let's Farrah, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon.
        - Okay, so yes, they used a small machine. Does anybody, anyone have the specific name of the machine?
        - um yeah so I totally agree with Jazmin here as the space expert in the group, and I think it's right because.
        - Awesome. Okay, it's Jazmin. So I was wondering, what can you talk me through your answer.
        - You understand that answer?
        - Why does that make water valuable.
        - You said that you circled the same as Farrah. What did you understand
        - um they used a microscope to find water on the moon.
        - Would you like to share more about your conclusion.
        - So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as Farrah. What is, what does that mean to you, why did you highlight that answer.
        - Okay sounds good alright so right now I am going to give each of you individually 30 seconds to read over your response and think about what made you write that response.
        - And yeah so they were looking at the ice deposits, the really small pieces of ice.
        - Oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out.
        - Okay, what do you think about that, why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the class.
        - So they used it to investigate. what makes you think that it's small.
        - I would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways, could we use water, why is it valuable.
        - and Luis Can you tell me a little bit about your answer. You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. So how can that make it valuable.
        - um yeah Okay, so I said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the moon, and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks.
        - Uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe.
        - Okay, so let's talk about that. Jazmin, did, why did you answer your question by using, by saying the words.
        - Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion.
        - Well, well, like you said, you know, I know a lot about space. And I know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon. So they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon.
        - Well, because when it says equipment. That means you have to look for, like, a tool for your answer. And so I said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - which part, are you confused about.
        - No, no, we saw the Mars Rover, but I don't remember seeing anything about a Lunar Orbiter.
        - What what makes you think that.
        - Exactly and where have you seen that information before.
        - Okay, what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah.
        - Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name.
        - Did you work with Savannh on this question?
        - What did you change your answer to
        - And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?
        - Okay. All right. Jazmin. I know that you were talking about a small machine, which is what equipment is right? Yeah?
        - So when you are listening and answering this question. How did you get to that answer.
        - Oh, okay. So first, tell me what made you say that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment.
        - What do you want me to tell you.
        - Why it's not ready.
        - I watch a lot of--
        - Yes, Okay, well, I found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called.
        -  Not sure.
        - Do you have a name for the small machine.
        - yeah i'm Oh, this is Farrah so I found my answer in part three, in paragraph three, where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, so I got my answer from paragraph three and I basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water. If you were going to like discover it. How could you discover it without without seeing?
        - Right, right, Oliver. And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence. What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence
        - Because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does
        - Is when you can look at things that are like really, really small.
        - Oh, well, what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing.
        - Well, like you use it to like study something. And like look at something really closely, you know what I mean like you, you look at it like like small things.
        - Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right
        - say more, why is it the answer to the question Oliver.
        - Okay. So when you say the small machine. Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?
        - You wrote the same thing. What did you, why did you circle those things?
        - Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small.
        - Basicallt my answer was incomplete, and I was just saying small machine instead of like that. It was the lunar orbiter, you know what I mean?
        - When she read her answer. She had circled the last sentence. I'm an animal story and I I circled the last sentence and the story to
        - All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer Farrah could you tell me what the answer was.
        - Okay, I.
        - Was that a question or a statement?
        - So a microscope is like something that you like you use to see something that's really small.
        - Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question.
        - Well, because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the key words in the question um, and so the key word in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that I underlined so.
        - So I said, I'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um I got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what
        - Let me ask Jazmin. Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer.
        - All right, Farrah. I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and Oliver try and explain why you picked microscope?
        - Because like I said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon, so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us, we will die.
        - yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - Why do you think it is a valuable resource Oliver.
        - um so Jazmin i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer.
        - Um, so I kind of was like, um,
        - So Chris. Can you talk me through your answer really quick.
        - Yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water. And when I read the story that I only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment, looking at the water
        - Great Farrah, can you build to your answer. What else was that article about water.
        - So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks.
        - um yeah so basically I was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water, because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see.
        - Yeah. So I think when I'm confused by is, um, I guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment.
        - Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to Farrah, can you tell me.
        - Okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon, and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so, then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship.
        - Well, I mean, since I know so much about space. I just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon. They can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff.
        - Um, so I guess it's kind of, it's kind of interesting. So I when I mean it's not ready yet, like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet. So, um, it's kind of like, it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence
        - What makes you think you got all figured out.
        - Farrah and Oliver. I want to, to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time. What made you say that
        - No. Right. Okay, so where did you get oxygen takes from in your. 
        - And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read
        - Okay, so that sounds good. Thank you. Luis But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon. So let's go back and look at our responses here. Now I did notice Farrah and Oliver had the same response. So which one of you would like to explain your response.
        - um I did the first time, and then I heard her say lunar orbiter and now I know it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer.
        - Well, I I thought that I I fixed my answer so now I have everything in it.
        - So so let's start with your response Luis, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, I wonder what made you see that.
        - No, I didn't really think of that.
        - Mmmhmm, about what?
        - That wasn't what they were asking I was trying to answer the question.
        - Cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here. So we can't breathe that era there.
        - Oh yeah that's interesting, how do you think you could work that into your answer.
        - Oh, like like
        - Can you tell me where they found the water on the moon.
        - Good. Okay. Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as Farrah. Can you explain what you mean by that.
        - Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said.
        - For me, loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer.
        - Okay, so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water
        - Oh yeah so my answer was i'm a.
        - Yeah. And what are those two different things. We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words. What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson.
        - Um, because I found it in the story and I know you told me last time that I have to look into it. Look in the text for my answers and not just because I know it already. And so
        - Why do you say that.
        - so Chris um tell me a little bit more about your response, what makes you think that the water, the creators are full of water.
        - Can you tell me why you're confused.
        - So let's actually go to you now, Luis. So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?
        - Well let's talk about Farrah's and Oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes. Oliver, can you explain a little bit more about that for me.
        - Can you tell me um, what do you have figured out, can you explain that to me?
        - In the first paragraph.
        - Oh well, anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff.
        - Yeah, sure. Okay, so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon.
        - Okay, so it said what equipment to the scientists use to the spot or the water on the moon. And so if there are scientists and they're all my own that gonna need. I need a lot of things, but they're definitely gonna need oxygen tanks.
        - They say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss Bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that.
        - I had a different answer from from them, but if they're all right, then the my answers right too?
        - It looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it lands at the moon South pole.
        - Um, well, because at the end, it says, making this plan will take a lot of time and money, they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment. So, I mean, they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon.
        - Well, because I was looking at the word equipment and I remembered in science class.
        - Like what?
        -  The water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I chose them because I think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use. And I think that that tells us why.  It's the equipment, because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope. So I'm thinking like, you know, you can't find it. If you can't see it
        - You had told me before that, that the microscope looked at the, the, the water but but it didn't discover the water. So then I was trying to find another machine in the story.
        - what did you mean by that.
        - Well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine.
        - So I thought, well, in terms of the question. I was thinking like what did they use to discover the water
        - Well, because you can have those chemicals.
        -  um well since i'm in this group.
        - Okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right.
        - So where are you confused Farrah
        - Um, well, okay. So first off, I feel like I should even be in this group. Like, I know a lot about space. And I know all this stuff. Like, I don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff. I already know that.
        - how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found.
        - cool, How did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water.
        - Farrah, can you tell me a little bit more What do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now.
        - Excellent. And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts.
        - Okay, well, if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water, I know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100%.
        - So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text.
        - Discover okay why discover?
        - Okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it, you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay.
        - Um, so I think if I remember it's like you. Um, okay. So in the text is said that, um, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, so like I guess it helps you look at small things.
        - Yes, that is what they sent. And Chris, what did they investigate when they got there?
        - Um Jazmin why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        -  um well actually I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - How is it used on the moon.
        - Yeah, so like I guess there's like all these craters. They got all this kind of water and all this stuff like um so they got like lots of water on the moon.
        - They were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and I actually went to NASA.
        - Okay amazing our event, so you don't you know a lot about science and space so Can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did, and what do you think of your peers on so so far.
        - So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's.You kind of both have very similar responses. So Luis Oh no, sorry, Oliver, you talk, you said no. It's not ready yet. So what do you mean by that.
        - looks like Chris saying no, it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos. Oliver i'm seeing your head shaking no to, why do you think no.
        - Thank you so much for reading. So, Chris, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?
        - All right, well, why do you think that's Farrah's right?
        - Okay Farrah Can you help me what is your confusion, is it the question?
        - Um, yeah, it was Oliver. He said he thought my answer was wrong, but I definitely don't agree.
        - Okay, and Oliver you had something, you have a similar idea as Farrah so, can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion.
        - um well cuz um well, I was looking for a name of equipment and I was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in.
        - And everyone's going to have an assigned partner to work with in with your partner. I want you to share your answer and explain why you had that answer for two minutes and then I want our partners to switch in the person who did not share will then share
        - What made you say that?
        - Okay, well, so the one I picked the.
        -  So, Farrah, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water. You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope. Why would they need to use a microscope.
        - yeah what what are you confused about, can you tell me, can you tell me.
        - Can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response, either one of you guys can share yeah.
        - Well, it says, it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover. So I said, Okay, the key word is equipment.
        - What do you mean all figured out.
        - that's your revised answer.
        -  In my brain.
        - Um, well, I guess I just kind of know that you know what I mean like that that waters really heavy and it, it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water, and it makes spaceships really
        - Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can. What made you say that
        -  I actually have a follow up question for you. Um, what made you. What made you say that as your answer what stuff. What really stood out to you. Why did you say that
        -  do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh.
        - I was referring to the Lunar orbiter yeah.
        - Oh yeah okay um so cuz I was looking for like you said, the arm the words in a question I was looking for equipment and water on the moon, and I saw in paragraph three.
        - And I know you know, and I just need you to help me to understand.
- intent: r230.2
  examples: |
        - yeah that was in paragraph three.
        - So I guess they're looking at like something really small. they're looking at the water. they're studying the water.
        - I found the answer in the second paragraph.
        - Shall we just go back and see together? since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that .so Jazmin, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from?
        - Yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like
        - Luis Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says
        -  and so I wonder, can you tell us where he where did you find that part in the text he Chris? yeah.
        - Can you show me where you found that?
        - Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that Luis. because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right? um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text.
        - That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that Luis. Farrah yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope. can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text?
        - Seeing nods. Thank you, thank you. So why don't we start with Oliver and Farrah. I saw you guys had some consensus. Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either Oliver or Farrah read that sentence for us?
        - And Oliver, what happened? How did they study that the small ice deposits?
        - Um, yeah, I can do that. Um, okay. Let's see. So, um,
        - Okay yeah, so I think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and I would say that that's my evidence.
        - Interesting. can you tell me where you found that in the article? 
        - Great and what makes you say that where did you find that information?
        - Let me see the first sentence in Part two
        - Is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text?
        - My answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says, scientists have evidence. the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters. So that's, that's where I got my part.
        - No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence?
        - Um you so talk to me about that. How much water did they find?
        - Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?
        - from paragraph three.
        - That's fantastic. Exactly. The more specific. We are in the texts. Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs?
        - Oh yeah well I just supposed to work on my scope. i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because I thought it was just a microscope and I don't think I want to pick small machine.
        - Oliver what you circle, you said you circle, the same thing as Farrah. can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled?
        - Okay, and do you have a specific sentence?
        - Um, let's see. It was, I think it was in paragraph three
        - So actually, and where did you find this answer? 
        - but what did the text makes you think that was the answer?
        - Farrah, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?
        - Well I guess what I'm trying to find, it says that in paragraph two, that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore?
        - Okay, yeah, it's the first sentence in section two. 
        - Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine?
        - See what you're saying, okay, okay. Yeah. Um, well, cuz you know I went to NASA and so I know that the scientists like they use a lot of like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff. And so I didn't know that it was like really dry there.
        - Oh well, I don't know about in the text, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - That is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters?
        - Yes, definitely. I found it in Part two
        - I guess because when I looked at the text. What I was thinking was basically like I was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters, and so I thought like, well, that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water. I was like, well, there's the water
        - You got your answer from did you did you circle, a certain part of the text where their context clues.
        - Yep. And that can be water can be split in those two different elements all right now. Luis Where did you find that in the text.
        - Thank you alright Jazmin so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text.
        - Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident.
        - Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?
        - To look closely, like to see something close
        - Really? I didn't know        - is that, did you get that from the passage?
        - Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks.
        - so Oliver, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater.
        - Oliver, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question.
        - yeah okay so um it was in part two, and it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - It's in
        - No, that's just what I kind of knew
        - Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists.
        - Asks a follow-up question to help students elaborate their response in relationship to the text (e.g., "Where in the text did you see…")
        - To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?
        - They did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew.
        - Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text.
        - can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine 
        - Well, I have to be honest, I don't think I read it very close because I thought I knew all this stuff. But it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe I didn't know
        - Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text.
        - Um, let's paragraph one.
        - Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence. And what are we using to investigate our evidence?
        - So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely. So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though.
        - it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?
        -  As well okay I gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks, because if there's astronauts on the loan, they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water.
        - So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question Luis.
        - yeah so it's in part three.
        - From the story?
        - No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope.
        - All right. So did they use the microscope to discover the water?
        - Would you mind, did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge.
        - Oh well, actually, well, I was just gonna say I I shouldn't even be in this group, because I already know all about space.
        - and where in the passage Chris, can we find one of those.
        - OK, so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so I found it in part three, and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope.
        - i'm so um I mean I already. know some stuff and. if there are scientists on the Moon, they need oxygen tanks.
        - And where did you get that idea from within the text. If you notice the word so you can explain
        - The very beginning of Part two
        - Now, I just want to discuss what made you circle, the answer that you did? okay.
        - I like the way you're thinking, can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used. 
        - Yeah, well. So here's the thing. So we were talking about it because we both know about space, but then when I looked at the at the story again, it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really
        - Yeah yeah I when I looked on, and to find the answer and I had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says
        - In part three, it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small.
        - So as you're reading. Where do you think Luis got the answer of the oxygen tanks.
        - um yeah so paragraph three, they were talking about a scientific tool, it says that mo story and that's on microscope.
        - um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does anyone have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to.
        - Oh, you mean the story.
        - Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use. How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?
        - It's in the first in the first paragraph 
        - Um, I guess it doesn't really say anything about like I'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff. I guess that was like from like my understanding.
        - Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss Jazmin, and you said that they sent a small machine. They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for
        - No they aren't in the story.
        - Well, I can I, yeah, I can look it up and try to see, um,
        - And I want to hear from Luis really quickly. Luis What evidence. Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you.
        - You could, but what is something on the moon that they could look at on the moon. They said the moon is a desert. What else could they look at if they say desert.
        - OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter.
        - So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage. What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage
        - yeah So could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out? So where did you find that information in this text?
        - Good. OK, and let's go to Chris. Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. I like that, that is very true. Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?
        - I guess maybe not very much water. So maybe it's not like full of water.
        - yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because I circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and I don't totally understand why.
        - Yes. So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?
        - Okay, well, we would be looking at the tiny Oh, what did they call them ice deposits.
        - Hmm. And where did you find that
        - Okay, I'm walking
        - yeah okay so basically when I looked at the end.
        - Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?
        - . Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?
        - Right, what's, what's the textual evidence to support Chris's claim with the main idea of the first Paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon.
        - Um, yeah, definitely. Okay. So I said, no, there is not convincing evidence because I'm though the water isn't ready yet. I mean, it's not like you could just go to the moon today and I'm drink the water and plant a garden.
        - So I think it was a trick question because I did not find it. And I think that was the thing right like
        - um.. No, not really but I saw them all, when I went to NASA so I know they use them
        - yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere Chris.
        - What paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - That's right, good job. It is the Lunar Orbiter. Can you tell me what paragraph you found. Yes, yes. Jazmin.
        - But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags.
        - Um, so like the Lunar Orbiter, I guess, like, okay, so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like
        - So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?
        - Yeah. So you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes. I was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text. Is there a Quote, that you remember
        - Someone mentioned, is that scientist need an oxygen tanks, can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can anyone tell me about please.
        - Oh, um, I didn't actually circle anything because I already know a bunch of stuff about
        - oxygen tank, how do you get that from text.
        - Um, oh, okay, I'm not really sure like exactly like the amount, like how many gallons or anything, but
        - That's one type of equipment. What else did they do with the equipment. What did it do?
        - yeah and then Jazmin quick quick update with you what part of the reading, did you find that in.
        - And I would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water. 
        - So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks.
        - But I just need you to write down where you found your answer.
        - Yeah, that's a really interesting question. So when I look at the, like, here's what I saw, I was thinking that okay a paragraph six
        - Yes, I can do that.
        - So good so in the text where did you find that in the text, what made you choose as your response.
        - I found it in paragraph number two.
        -  yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money, so I don't think it's that valuable.
        -  On part three.
        - And Jazmin, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer.
        -  And we were looking at paragraph two moment ago to specifically answer that question. So what was the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate?
        - Oh, I see. You found that in paragaph two as well right?
        - let's see where where did you find that in the text.
        - Yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope.
        - Oh, no. No, Um OK. So the only things that I saw was the microscope that Farrah and Oliver said and the lunar orbiter that Jazmin said.
        - I, well, I guess, those aren't from the story, but I just thought because we were talking about equipment.
        - Can you read me the sentence of one of them.
        - All right. Well, let's think about it this way, Jazmin, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?
        - yep yep yep okay um paragraph two, and the second sentence.
        - Okay, can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three.
        - Well, I guess based on like Jazmin's I guess the Lunar Orbiter.
        - yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us.
        - Okay. And so that's very good, Farrah. and Oliver, is that where you found your evidence as well?
        - hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on Farrah could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer.
        - Well they talked about it in part two. That's where I found my answer. And I guess I know I was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine.
        - Circle that at the beginning of paragraph to
        - Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine. Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included.
        - Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water.
        - That's right. Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that
        - um yeah so I don't think I need to be in this group, because I already know, like all about space.
        - So, Jazmin. Do you have text evidence from your response. You said NASA send a small machine. Do you read about that.
        - How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph.
        - Yeah. It was in paragraph three.
        - All right, what, what part of this text that you read gave you the impression that they had to use them.
        - Well, I guess I can see how the small machine or I guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like I could see how that was used to discover.
        - Jazmin What in the text drove you to your answer.
        - I can look it up.
        - Well, I didn't say your answer was wrong. It is technically correct, they did send a small machine, but what kind of small machine, did they send? Can you tell me that Jazmin.
        - yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with Jazmin so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different.
        - I read paragraph two where it says
        - But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. What are some things that are listed in the text. Yes, a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text.
        - So I'm also going to follow the same question for you. What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking.
        - I don't know. They found water deep in the craters. They sent a machine to look for ice.
        - So I saw it in paragraph two, and that was, yeah, that was right.
        - Okay, they sent a small machine. And where did you see that at?
        - So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from.
        - Do you remember what the small machine was called
        - It was in the same sentence as the one that I i had my, my first answer in paragraph to, um, but I just added the name of the machine.
        - So I'm glad you said that. So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and Chris, what exactly what language or what part of that. Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me.
        - Well, I mean, I, I guess. Yeah, but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope, you know, like they have to be able to see it in order to study it.
        - Right so Farrah where in the text did you find the microscope?
        - um cuz I was looking for equipment right, and so, when I was reading I only saw two places in paragraph two, or they see a small machine and then paragraph three, where they see the microscope.
        - If you will refer back to your article back to your reading. I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water Jazmin, I see your hand up. Yes.
        - What did you read
        - So you found that from the text right.
        - So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find.
        - On yeah yeah I can do that. Okay, so let's see. Um,
        - and did you circle that sentence in the text.
        - I circled it in the last paragraph, but it was just hard Farrah said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me. Well, yeah, it's the last, the last sentence. And the last paragraph.
        - so Chris, do you see oxygen tanks in this text.
        - Let me pull up my text, which paragraph was that in.
        - Oh no, it was in the first paragraph.
        - Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - Oh OK, so I saw that i'm excited the first paragraph, it, they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water.
        - and just a second the Oliver can you find where the microscope is in text.
        - Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable
        - So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know. Why don't you look back now.
        - Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?
        - Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph. Did you find the information about the crater.
        - Oh okay I got it, I read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing Oh, it sounds amazing and it's in part two. 
        - Awesome. And I see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five, is that correct
        - Okay, so I had basically I said that know that it's not ready yet. And I was looking in paragraph. It's paragraph.
        - All right, that is very true I want you to walk me through where you found that answer.
        - do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming
        - Absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic So what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy.
        -  Paragraph five. 
        - Yeah, so, um, info which paragraph was it. Okay, yeah. In the first one because it's the whole. The title is water is a valuable resource right
        - Can you tell us where in the text Jazmin you found this information?
        -  I do have a question for you. Is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article. Do you remember, or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on Earth.
        - Okay, this isn't a small machine coated Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Farrah. Have you found it.
        - Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono. So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water
        - yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph, where it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Um yeah like I think they just use basically like um like spacesuits and like I know cuz I went to NASA. So like they use like oxygen tanks and and masks and suits like to go flying around in space.
        - um I found it in part three.
        - So Chris. Do me a favor, go back into the text. Help me understand what led you to your conclusion.
        - and where they found the evidence in the tax alright 
        - In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you guys to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope.
        - Okay, I'm not a lot
        - I'm wondering how is your answer, different from Jazmin and what evidence did you use To explain how your you got a different answer from Jazmin and what evidence you used
        - Yes exactly where you found it.
        - So, I see deposits are very small. Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?
        - Where did you find your answer?
        - Okay, so let's. Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence. Did you circle in the text.
        - Oh. No.
        - Okay. Yeah. Okay. Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?
        - On say well sorry.
        - You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank.
        - That's okay. Could I read to you the sentence that I'm thinking and you tell me if that's where you found your answer. 
        - Oh um yeah.
        - Um, yeah, I can do that. Let's see. Um,
        - yeah so I circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at
        - Um, yeah. So I pretty much have the same place and the same idea. Um, I think adding to Farrahs answer like I think that you have to use the microscope to see it. You can't like find it, I guess, unless you can see it.
        - Oh, well, I noticed that the first time because I was looking for the word equipment and then I didn't see equipment. So when I was looking for it, I was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water. And so that's how I found it there, but I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Could you share with the class The section that mentioned this tool.
        - Some details. Well, okay. So we know that, like, there's a few things that you could do.
        - So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking.
        - Yeah. I went to NASA, so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, and masks, and suits, but the crater part was in the beginning of the story. (WHISPERING) No atmosphere. Oh, here it is. OK, scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters.
        - that's a that's a really good question um, I guess, let me look at see i'm.
        - And what else did you, did you read
        - Perfect and Jazmin. Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in
        - Um, well, like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water
        - Yeah, well, I guess, I guess in the reading. I guess I can look and see.
        - And what does that lunar orbiter do?
        - All right, awesome Thank you alright Chris, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat.
        - Okay, and Jazmin, what was the small machine called
        - I found it in Part two
        - Alright, so let's go look. Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there.
        - All right, thank you so Farrah where did you find your answer in the text.
        - I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - To paragraph two,
        - In the reading?
        - When I read the text again like a.
        - But then I want you to tell me where you find the evidence. Okay.
        - Okay, so basically, so what I circled in the text was that the the microscope. Know what I mean like that the microscope was
        - NASA send this machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate, so Lunar Orbiter.
        - Jazmin, what evidence did you circle to help you answer.
        - Oh Oh well, no I guess it's just when I read it It reminded me of going to NASA and I know that we have to say it Whitman, and so it made me think of that appointment.
        - And we also read in the paragraphs. What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools.
        - I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech. So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used Farrah, let's start with you.
        - Chris. Let's talk about your answer. You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon. Uh huh. What paragraph. Does that tell us that that happened.
        - Oh well, I wasn't quite sure, because when I was looking at it, it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water, but maybe he was thinking about the craters, like in part one, it says craters.
        - And if you don't see it, that's okay too.
        - Um, well, I didn't really get it from the text, a kind of just knew it. So I didn't really like get it from the reading.
        - Well, your answer says they use a microscope to look really closely, but what are they looking closely at what can they use it to focus on, like, are they looking at something really small, or really big. Yes, Farrah?
        - No, I just I just knew that because I watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like YouTube and you know on the internet and stuff.
        - Luis Where did you come up with your answer.
        - Oh that's all true right, so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um, can I ask did they, did you see the ma        - any of what you saw mentioned in the text?
        - Oh, I'm not sure.
        - Yes, you do. But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her
        - Okay, it was in the last paragraph.
        - yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water.
        - Yeah. Um, cuz uh Oliver and Chris read it too. It was the first sentence of the second paragraph, I was listening.
        - Okay, so that's in part three, the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says, you need a microscope to see it.
        - So what do you guys think about that. Where is the evidence that might help you with this question.
        -  OK, so my answer is NASA sent a small machine and I found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2.
        - Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and.
        - I'm. Excuse me, excuse me, I have my hand up.
        - What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen. How are they going to use the hydrogen?
        - OK. So it says that NASA's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit. Well, I mean and you told us to look at this paragraph. So--
        - Yes, and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text, which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph?
        - But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource.
        - But what was the name of that small machine. Does anybody know
        - yeah I read it last story.
        - Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that
        - On the Internet or cuz, I would like to read about what's going on at NASA and so there was an article on the Internet, talking about some of the work that are that the scientists are doing to try to find.
        - Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense. That's what came first, in the text right?
        - Good all right i'm going to call on Jazmin first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information.
        - So def. You said you had the same answer as Farrah. Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading
        - So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that.
        - Oh, where did you find that in the text.
        - Yeah, so it's on paragraph, paragraph three, it says scientists need a scientific tool called a microscope, because the water, the water is so small.
        - Oh, it was paragraph three.
        - Farrah, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?
        - I can do that. I guess what I saw, so NASA it's in paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate. So I guess it's the lunar orbiter, right?
        - Good. Okay. And where did you find in the text that it talked about microscope.
        - Well what paragraph, did you get that from?
        - Okay, and Jazmin you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text. Where did you find your evidence.
        - Okay so in paragraph two, and it says, NASA send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - They use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there
        - Okay, so, um, I don't know where Chris got his answer because if you read the story, it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything.
        - And so I was focusing on paragraph two, because that's where I found my answer, so it says NASA send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph, it says that the ice deposits are very small.
        - Wonderful. Okay, Farrah does Jazmin answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three
        - Chris, what evidence did you circle.
        - I found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence.
        - oxygen tanks. Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well.
        - Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence. Farrah where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?
        - Luis You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks. What are they using that for
        -  Yes, so I circled the part where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what Chris had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing. Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?
        - Yeah, that's right. Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?
        - So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?
        -  I read it online and well if there's water on the moon, it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years.
        - Did you finding the passage.
        - You can say The number of the point it was on. So like the microscope part, where was that?
        - So Jazmin was that answer directly from the text first.
        - Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks. But what does it tell us in the story?
        - Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used.
        - Okay, so basically, okay. And let's see it's in the second reading, the water is a valuable resource.
        - Oh yeah, okay. Oh, this is why, this is why I picked this. Okay. Um, it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel.
        - and Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story.
        - And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer. How did you find that answer.
        - When we look back at it.
        - Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks.
        - Gotcha. So I want everyone to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer.
        - And where did you read that.
        - Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to.
        - mm hmm that's true and where's Oliver Do you remember, where the microscope part was.
        - Okay, well yeah I I can read it. I also want to say that I don't think I should be in this group, I already know a lot about space.
        -  um okay well I just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water, I definitely have oxygen tanks.
        - In the third paragraph.
        - Um, yeah, basically, that was on the same because it was all the equipment that I could see
        - Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text.
        - Okay. Oliver why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,
        - Can you read that sentence, do you have it circle in your APP.
        - OK. So when I looked back, I actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story.
        - Let me see. I can't quite remember. 
        - Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?
        - Great. Can you tell me where what you found.
        - Okay, so when I was looking at it.
        - Oliver Maybe you can tell us, can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope.
        - Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text. Our items, did anyone see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found. I'm seeing a shake head from Oliver. 
        - We're looking for water.
        - Okay. And so, Farrah. Why did you underline that in paragraph two.
        - Right. So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically
        - It's this paragraph five, but I guess it's the second paragraph, this next one.
        - At the at the end of the paragraph, um,
        - yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3.
        - yeah so um So yes, it definitely is a small machine, but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer.
        - I'm okay. I'm okay to investigate.
        - So can we go back right now, and we can all look at our responses, think about what we said. And can we all think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that. You can go now.
        - Yes, I found it in, in paragraph three on it. Some where they talk about how the waters microscopic
        - Good. And so you said they sent this machine. So what did this machine, do.
        - In the first sentence in paragraph 2. It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - In part two.
        - Wow, that's awesome Background information. Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc.
        - Ah, they could look at like the sand and like the dirt.
        - Oh, well, they sent up. It sounds like Jazmin, just like the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh, okay. So, um, and the last part, it says I'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything, because it's not ready yet.
        - hard to find an answer from.
        - Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy. So read that sentence again for me.
        - Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine.
        - What equipment they used to find it.
        - In the first paragraph um yeah it's I took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters.
        - And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?
        - Yeah, I have a good idea.
        - Was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by, could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon. 
        - Yeah. So, in paragraph three, it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different.
        - Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?
        - did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable.
        - Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?
        - In the text. Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water
        - Why did you give us this answer? where do you find it in the text?
        - But what are we looking closely for?
        -  Okay, so um I found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as Mike ruskell um so I guess i'd probably say those two things.
        - Okay, well, so in part.
        - Does I'm pretty cool. If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel. Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts.
        - Um, so does anybody remember what the name of that machine was called
        - Oh, well I just know a lot about space because I watch videos on YouTube and I watch stuff about rocket launches and I really know a lot about astronauts. So, um, I just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks.
        - Very good. Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is
        - So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from?
        - The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text, 
        - I I I don't.
        - so Farrah, could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope.
        - I want you guys to take a second to locate
        - Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?
        - yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom, it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely.
        - No, no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to NASA and I read that maybe they could put some, a base up there, so it'll make things easier.
        - Oh, there it is. There it is. Okay, your paragraph five in my second sentence. Yeah.
        - Okay Oliver. Where did you find in the text to support your answer.
        - Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?
        - So actually I didn't even really read it, because I already know a lot about space and I already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how I got that piece.
        - Okay, so when I was reading. I thought that. Okay. So one of the key words in the question was what. So I said, Okay, so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding.
        - Yeah, because you said look for this specific machine. And so when I went back and look for the specific machine that was the equipment itself Lunar Orbiter and
        - So where in the article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks.
        - yeah yeah it's it's in Part two
        - And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine.
        - um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?
        - Yes. Did you see that in the text.
        - yeah okay well i'm really That was the part that Chris just read aloud where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence, right after what Chris read.
        - Teacher : Luis You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Where did you see oxygen tanks.
        - so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?
        - Could you tell me where you found that in the text.
        - um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?
        - Totally. There's a paragraph. That's what I was saying, the water is microscopic he wouldn't be able to see it.
        - okay yeah well first that's equipment And then I found it in the third paragraph.
        - You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence. Did you circle.
        - Right. So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?
        - So it's using the equipment to do what?
        - Oh yeah, I can tell you, but
        - Teacher : So a scientific tool called a microscope. To look really closely. Okay. Did you find evidence of that in the text.
        - Okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four: for example, future astronauts could drink this water.
        - So i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph, what evidence, do you use to your answer?
        - Yes, good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so How does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use.
        - But we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text. So that you know where you saw that in the text?
        - Although I see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all I was missing was the name of the machine, right. So I said, like NASA send this small machine, but I have to say, like, what evidence is, I have to say what it is, right?
        - Farrah, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?
        - um, can you tell me why did you decide to say the word microscope like where did you find that 
        - Oh yeah Okay, well, I found it in part three, where it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Perfect. And do you remember where we found that?
        - Okay, its got look and its got investigate
        - Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope. What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope.
        - Okay, so it's paragraph three, and it says the water is, the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you. I just, I just need the actual text, please.
        - Now, do me a favor. Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion. What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope. In fact, everybody look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person.
        - yeah I think I think I think Luis has something to say though um and and I'll answer maybe after him. 
        - And Farrah, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that.
        - yeah yeah I did.
        - know the story, the story just says the small machine and the microscope.
        - So So Deb. Let's look at microscope. Did you find where we can find microscope and and there
        - Oh no No, sorry I was thinking about like what would be like oh so the Lunar orbiter is like.
        - Since we've looked at Jazmin's answer and Luis's answer. Let's look a little closer at Chris's answer. So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where Chris got his answer and what you might Luis yeah
        - Luis could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Oh, where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph.
        - I could click to when I will do a new paragraph.
        - the Lunar orbiter.
        - Is that where you found your answer.
        - I'm not sure what what to pull. 
        - Does this mention.
        - um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up.
        - Mm-hmm. And what made you think that from the passage?
        - i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for kids.
        - To discover the water
        - Um, oh, oh, well, no, not in this story, but I just know that if there were astronauts, they would need all of those things.
        - Okay, from your text it says that you would need what to see the water?
        - So I was looking for.
        - Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made.
        - Right. Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope.
        - Right, so what would we be looking at in the text, what did it say that we would have to be looking at.
        - yeah exactly.
        -  Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as Farrah but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because.
        - Yeah, I think I found it. Oh, oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says, water is heavy. It takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft
        - So, Jazmin have you found some more details in the reading about what the machine was called?
        - Chris. What was one piece of evidence that you thought About this that some evidence that said water could be valuable.
        - No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um.
        - Yeah they do use that that is a really good point. And do you know when we answer these I want you guys to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text. So where do you think you found that one.
        - Oliver. What evidence did you use
        - I feel like you said section two and section three.
        - Um, so they basically used the microscope that Farrah mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes.
        - Why, why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text. Okay.
        - In the, in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?
        - Um, well, I kind of know about space. Um, I didn't really read that.
        - Having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - What is this, what was the small machine called
        - So, Jazmin, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water.
        - And when I look back in. I saw like what it, what it said it said. Let me read it. It said NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate. So was it the lunar orbiter?
        - Could you share with us where you found where you read um or just I can read your answer: scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So could you like just show 
        - yeah i'm Okay, so it says, well, I mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes Farrah.
        - Okay, the first sentence in Part Two says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        -  mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers.
        - I was just gonna say that I was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like I think they understand like, so in this being the right answer.
        - I am I sure did. 
        - Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article.
        - The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. Where did you find evidence that
        - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think that's important that they. It's really heavy. And so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's, um, that's important to
        - It was in paragraph three when it says, the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - yeah OK, so the part I circled is okay, the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope.
        - Chris, can you show me where you found that in the article.
        - Luis have you found were in the story you want us to focus on.
        - awesome alright so Oliver where did you find the information about microscope and the text.
        - Right. But does it mention that in the paragraphs?
        - And what makes you think that way. Farrah based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing.
        - How did. Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water.
        - Oh, this is Oliver. I'm really sorry, but actually we have to go and I wanted to say thank you so much for really
        - Okay, I might not have read the whole thing, let me see.
        - But what equipment do you think they used to find it. What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used
        - Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that.
        - Okay, well, I mean.
        - You know what the small machine was called?
        - yeah it's in paragraph five
        - So what are some things all of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five.
        - Well that's wonderful.
        - Good. Okay. So when I look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says.
        - Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go.
        - Mm hmm. And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things
        - it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - Was that a big clue for you.
        - Using a microscope as a piece of equipment.
        - So, can you tell me like where you found this answer, Luis?
        - Where did you get your answer from, Chris
        - Okay, so let's basically, I think. Let's see. So you to paragraph three, and we were saying, okay, the water they found is microscopic
        - Oh, so like I gotta do like
        - Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Ah, yeah. Okay, so I got my answer from like I know about like space and stuff. So I already kind of knew the answer to this question. I don't think I really need to be in this group, because I don't really need help with this stuff, you know,
        - You're right. So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word. What do you think that
        - It's in it's in part three. It's in part three, paragraph three, they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope.
        -  Okay, my answer is NASA Center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - yeah yeah just in the following sentence, right.
        - Well, I guess I didn't really look at the text because I already knew this.
        - Luis. Help me, help me with yours. I asked you to find where you found your information in the text. Where'd you see it.
        - Um, yeah, let me see. 
        - On Okay, so in part it's right at the beginning, so it says, scientists have found evidence that.
        - Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment.
        - No, I couldn't find anything in there.
        - What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence.
        - Okay, I found it in part three.
        - Yeah, and Farrah. Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?
        - Alright, so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question.
        - Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you.
        - Um, you know, I actually was thinking about all that I knew about space and I kind of knew that, you know, the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and
        - I don't know. Where would I, let's see, I guess it's like the lunar orbiter, is that the machine?
        - Now, when Farrah found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?
        - yeah that's something I didn't.
        - Hey, oh yeah, that was it.
        - yeah which line it's.
        - The Lunar Orbiter. Great. Can you read me that sentence? Where you can find that?
        - So Farrah can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say.
        - Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence.
        - Good. Okay. So you talked about NASA sending a small machine. If we look back at the text. What did it send the small machine to do? 
        - Chris you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore. So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?
        - In paragraph five, did you find it.
        - Did you read that in the article.
        - Oh, a lot, where do you find this information.
        - and that was in the tax Luis, can you tell me where in the text you found those words hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay um so what in the text makes you think that.
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you talked about that NASA send something. Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin.
        - i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be Chris Jazmin Luis. Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?
        - Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence.
        - So Farrah, you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle, the same thing. Now where in the text. Can you point that out, just so that everyone's on the same page.
        - So Oliver. Did you find that answer in the in the text?
        - yeah so Jazmin can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that.
        - Yeah. In paragraph 3, it was the last sentence of the text that I found it.
        - Um investigate
        - Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us.
        - Um a space shuttle
        - Okay, and what was a small machine called
        - so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text.
        - So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand.
        - Okay, so in paragraph two, NASA scientists small machine called Lunar Orbiter. So it says lunar orbiter right?
        - What do I think is the right answer.
        - Ok so
        - It says that, like in the first sentence, they found evidence that there's water deep in the polar craters but Chris. I don't know if it's like full of water, but, um, it's in the craters.
        - Oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text.
        - Cool. And did you get that information from the reading that we did.
        - It's in paragraph two, and actually I have a question about that. So I knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers. And I'm wondering, like, what might be wrong about my answer.
        - Very good. I'm so how did you find that answer. Did you look back in the text using your keywords.
        - Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is
        - On part three.
        - And, but let's. Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?
        - Yeah, exactly. I know that a microscope is a tool.
        - Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay
        - What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water Chris.
        - um, I also would like to know what you guys circled in the text. I know that you guys have formulated some answers, but what what led you to your answers? Oliver.
        - um Okay, so it actually talks about a microscope and part three, and because it says on water is really small, so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely.
        - Yeah, cause I read the question. I'm like, here are some words, you're saying
        - Where did you read that in the text.
        - Okay, well what paragraph. Do you think we can find that in
        - So there's this part on Part three, and it says the water is microscopic. So how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it. That's why I thought you'd need the microscope.
        - Farrah's nswer. I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not Farrah Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah. Where did you find your answer.
        - So in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?
        - And I notice Jazmin said that NASA sent a small machine so Jazmin, can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that NASA sent?
        - Okay, I remember it was in the beginning um yeah and paragraph one, and why I chose, it was because I was looking for some of the key words in the question.
        - Well, they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them.
- intent: r230.3
  examples: |
        - So I work from all the different students that each student found a different tool to use.
        - Well, I don't know if i'd call it a machine, but you, you talked about a scientific tool right?
        - Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or. 
        - Very good. So that's a very good observation on your part Chris. And then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people. So that's very useful.
        - Um, well, water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Going back to you i'm wondering, do you see Jazmin? so Jazmin talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon. does that sound like something that maybe.
        - So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can
        - Okay um so Luis your answer was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?
        - Exactly right. So something that is useful or important already. so something that is useful or important
        - hmm you know that's really interesting point because it's true that when humans go to the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks to breathe.
        - You're kind of saying that it's important. They found water. That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so
        - Yes, yes it. Good job. Chris you Luis are on the same page.
        - Oliver, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm Farrah. Is that right?
        - Okay. Um, but you said that the water they found right?
        - At the craters on the moon and Jazmin was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine. All of these are good pieces of information from our passage
        - That is true right? so it's similar to kind of Farrah's thinking as well right?
        - From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water.
        - You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water. That is exactly right. The astronauts. We do need water to survive. Right. And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right. now in our text you know how it said
        - and I would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals.
        - Okay, now, so. So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet.
        - and your answer is scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water.
        - so let's think back to your answer, because your answer says that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Oh, I thought that the most important word in the question was, discover
        - Ah, OK. So you really focus on the word microscope. that's something that you really focused on.
        - Right, they would need water to drink. So, Oliver, you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research?
        - Okay, sure. Yeah, I had a different keyword from Chris and mine was on equipment.
        - So you guys said microscope. 
        - so um Jazmin was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes, she did not the right answer, but she needs to be more specific, so I just looked at her sentence.
        -  now, Farrah, and Oliver you guys mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water.
        - Very good. And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter. Correct?
        - That's a great idea. That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food. And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you.
        - Okay, so let's let's think about your answer. So you said they use Microsoft's correct?
        - Definitely, so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find        - they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it. 
        - And so, carrying all that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon. 
        - So I just wanted to clarify that. So you said the water is not ready to eat. To us yet. Is that what you're trying to say?
        - Right. Yeah, because it's so small, like Luis was saying.
        - We went back to the text and we looked for evidence right?  what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering?
        - You're right. Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon.
        - Yeah, it was frozen.
        - I love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right, but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job Jazmin really good work.
        - Okay, well, good job, for sure. Um, it would be very expensive. Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive.
        - Yeah, oh yeah, that was in part two the small machine.
        - Um, yeah. So I kind of went in. I was looking at, like, um, I guess, Lunar Orbiter.
        - yeah I had the same answer
        - yeah, and so I think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like Oliver and Farrah said what might happen in the future is what Luis just said
        - So Farrah and Oliver, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together and Chris i'll be with you in just a second.
        - hmm so investigate right find right are great words, Oliver the same thing that you said, right all of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right 
        - answer too, he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, so they used all the that equipment and the eating that terrible food.
        - So space exploration and finding water on space, there are a lot of steps and processes that come with that right and and Jazmin you you touch on a really important part of that, as do Farrah and Oliver. 
        - that's awesome so what Farrah told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel. Right. And also, Chris was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it.
        - yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say.
        - But what we did with Farrah. If you remember, if I had Farrah Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really
        - Nothing. I can't remember who said it but you have saving way. I think it was Chris right
        - so Farrah I noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment.
        - To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon. We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen.
        - Addition there. So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there. You talk about a to look really close.
        - Hmm.
        - And you highlighted the microscope, just like Farrah. 
        - yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable.
        - Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes. So these are all the things that you should listen
        - To restate the question to the form your answer. Yes.
        - Okay, great so i'm hearing that you have heard, everyone talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do, and you tried that and it worked out yeah.
        - Awesome. So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found Chris, what did you want to add
        - yeah yeah I I was looking for equipment, because I thought that was the key word and.
        - Okay, so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, and then Farrah, you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right
        - Okay, so, Jazmin just gave us an excellent answer. She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from Oliver. He said he thought it was in paragraph three.
        - So Farrah mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny. So that's a very, very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer.
        - I think I got this figured out, so I'm all good. 
        - It's not ready yet. Your answer isn't ready yet.
        - Well, I guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things. But I guess I'm confused. Like, it sounds like the answer of Jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like Oliver and Farrah. Like, I don't understand, like, did the astronauts who saw the water, did they use a microscope.
        -  He shared that they use these tools and the Lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use. Jazmin pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called. Okay, so I want to circle back to Farrah Farrah.
        - To Farrah earlier and gave her some suggestions.
        - yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz I was listening in class for saying like Jazmin was saying, it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um.
        - And so, Farrah, you've mentioned that it will be a long time.
        - Machine was sent to investigate.
        - Awesome. Good job. That's, that's really good. So you saw equipment in the discussion question.
        - So I see that Oliver and Farrah. You guys said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable. 
        - Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space.
        - You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more
        - So what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and I love that I love.
        - Farrah, you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely.
        - So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct.
        - And I, I want to ask another question. When you said that. So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph. Right.
        - Yes. Yes. I think that's why I said that, because I got that from the story.
        - Very good. So Oliver also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage. 
        - place, I really like that, and I agree, so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right.
        - That's a use all those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do.
        - Farrah and Oliver, both of y'all kind of said no it's not ready.
        - Um Farrah I liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things, but in the future, we might be able to.
        - Farrah is telling us that in paragraph three, there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see. 
        - Yes, that's what I said.
        - So Farrah is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon.
        - Very good. So it comes first in the story. And then we use the microscope to identify the water
        - So Chris is saying that you guys are both right that they use the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah. Okay. So let's think about putting all of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us
        - So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment. Yes. Luis
        - Alright, everyone, I think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something Luis Can you help me oh.
        - you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward. 
        - On you saturate have to add more details to her thing so I'm
        - Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?
        - That's okay. Thank you for raising your hand so Farrah thought it was in paragraph three, and Jazmin thought it was in paragraph two,
        - Okay, that's a good job. Jazmin. So it looks like so far, Farrah, and Jazmin. You guys have both talked about equipment. 
        - Hey everybody. Farrah. I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit. You said that you use the microscope to look closely.
        - Okay, I think I got it now and i'm all good.
        - yeah um I I have an idea.
        - Yeah, that was my response. Yeah. 
        - So Oliver and Farrah think that it was the microscope in Jazmin and Luis Both think it was the lunar orbiter.
        - So Chris, I'm hearing that You think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships.
        - Ok so you both said the small machine. 
        - So we're looking so we've narrowed it down. We have our small machine. And we have a microscope. 
        - yeah and so kind of tying what Chris read back to what Farrah was asking like why isn't that answer correct that it's not ready to be used yet.
        - It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment. Right.
        - Was yes absolutely Okay, so we picked up some important keywords in that question right.
        - So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine Jazmin, but Farrah was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope. 
        - Now, let's see. Let's see. I'm Farrah. I really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Absolutely. Jazmin, we can use the water for drinking. We can also use the oxygen for breathing. 
        - From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there.
        - And then, what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right.
        - The question.
        - Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable. Okay, so
        - We want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned, and your response Jazmin that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right?
        - right they do and that's exactly what Luis told me right so Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?
        - Waters, so it's good. They don't have to Carry it in the ships anymore.
        - But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you guys sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers. Oliver yeah.
        - Oh, good job. So it's something that
        - It is very heavy. Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do.
        - That we haven't seen it yet. I appreciate that. I do agree with you. We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but
        - Okay, so Oliver and Farrah you guys did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um.
        - And we'll start with a Oliver this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct.
        - Well, I guess, like when I am trying to advocate for our environment and I go out and I I pass out leaflets to try to tell people what they can do. I try to convince them.
        - From your evidence. It sounds like you think, yes. Is that true
        - Great and Luis talked about the oxygen tanks right?
        - Well, they were talking about it. I'm paragraph one, but um
        - yeah they are really been a you're correct, so you had mentioned that you visit a NASA before correct and so out of all.
        - To go around, right. So, Chris shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something 
        - um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now.
        - Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer. You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. That is very true. You definitely can't. So it is very valuable to have the water
        - Now, let's see, Jazmin. You also said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - All right. All right. Let's then switch track. Let's take care of that. Let's see here. So, Jazmin, you said NASA sent a small machine. And that's true.
        - Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships, 
        - Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space. Don't you? 
        - I'm jab and Farrah you both wrote no to this answer. And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet.
        - To NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks.
        - So that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer, and then I also liked what Oliver and Farrah mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead Chris.
        - Awesome. Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there. So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct
        - And then Jazmin you just identified for us a specific piece of equipment that the article mentions is us on the moon when scientists are looking for water.
        - Jazmin told us that it was a small machine and Luis added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon,
        - read what you wrote your class. Um, so, Farrah, you said not for a long time. Right, so that. So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now. Right. Is that right, is that what you meant by that. Okay. Okay, so
        - How great so you guys have the same answer in the end that they use the Lunar orbiter 
        - yeah yeah that's my answer.
        - Yeah, I also thought it was a microscope, because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment. 
        - yeah I just heard it when I was reading my answer when you said what equipment was 
        - You think it's the microscope.
        -  Speaking of drinking water, Jazmin, you mentioned astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without it. That is true.
        - I really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration, whereas the other people like Dave and someone I have talked about the costs of this exploration.
        - You did correct your answer, but your answer. Um, you said using a small machine, Luis.
        - Right, so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe, breathe, but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon.
        - Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. So you're saying no. 
        - You're very good drink it. And that's something that's valuable to them because we all have to have water to stay hydrated. Right.
        - Reach Every Reader:You can drink it, you can make rocket fuel. Oh, you can breathe it, they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen.
        - And I saw that in your answer. You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        -  So I think you guys are on the right track with that and then Chris and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used
        - Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff
        - Farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil 
        - and Chris, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening.
        - Yes. Which would also go in with what Chris was saying about water is so heavy. If they had water on the moon, they could use that to drink, and they wouldn't have to carry the water all over the place and save up some room for their stops. What do you think about that, Chris?
        - To look really closely. Good. So is there. Remember how we talked
        - so you wrote about water being heavy.
        - Okay. Yeah. And I agree with you, Jazmin. I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well. But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water. 
        - Well, I just, I, I kind of like, okay, I was thinking about out my dad took me to NASA.
        - Soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter.
        - So I think, I think you guys have it. I think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do all these different things, especially if we can put a moon base on the moon.
        - awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?
        - so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right 
        - Oh, I was just going to share my answer.
        - yeah okay Okay, so you just want to say one thing from the story, and then you could say some stuff you know too.
        - So Farrah and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned-actually Luis you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used. 
        - Right, so the name of that small machine, you just said is a lunar orbiter.
        - Perfect so answering that Jazmin answered it perfectly. She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope.
        - um so Oliver and Farrah, i'm going to come back to you guys. Farrah, you said that you have used a microscope before right?
        - So are all these things we just talked about that have value.
        - So you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the Lunar orbiter to clarify.
        - But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer. You said that you could
        - So the moon, we said.
        - Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more.
        - And just very quickly so vana brought up the idea that she said that it was a microscope was used to find the water and then we're talking with Jazmin about the small machine that she identified in the text so we're going to start there but 
        - Let's see, Farrah and Oliver, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true.
        - and Jazmin you had said that water is something they can drink to stay hydrated right 
        - Mm hmm. Great. I love that answer. So it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used. 
        - So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with Farrah. Farrah you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so Luis yes.
        - This is a great start, we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence Jazmin.
        - OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about. And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it. And that tells me that you understood it.
        - Chris um, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right?
        - So I guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both.
        - actually even said something about that in his answer didn't he that scientists use a lot of equipment, including oxygen tanks, which is totally right.
        -  Farrah and Oliver, I see that you have identified a tool used by the scientists to see things that are very small.
        - yeah yeah I I did that, so I think I got this all figured out i'm all good.
        - Okay. So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it. It has no value, right.
        - You are welcome and, Chris, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon. Right?
        - Good. Awesome. Good. So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat.
        - right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words.
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits
        - They said that they wanted a microscope.
        - That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very-        - sorry Chris. And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now. Astronauts have to carry it in space. But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable.
        - yeah they could drink it and then like Oliver said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water  To get some air, so that they can breathe right 
        - Yeah, I just wanted to remind you, my dad as actually an astronaut.
        - yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the Lunar orbiter and then Luis said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there, so that's why yeah.
        - so I know that we're talking with Jazmin when we left off and Jazmin also said that she agreed with what Farrah said That the microscope is used to look at the water on the moon.
        - Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs. There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable.
        - And that special tool is what Farrah mentioned Farrah, you mentioned that you they use a scientific tool called a microscope. Yes.
        -  so Chris, you had said waters is heavy so it's hard to bring it up in ships right it's A lot of weight for the spaceship to bring .
        - Yeah. And so, so we know the water, the water is there. Right. I mean, Chris you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon.
        - That the amount of money that we put into invest in this, we won't get returns
        - Okay, so since you said, and with no so that means there's is there small amounts of water on the moon as what we believe.
        - Well, the fact that they were on the moon, and the fact that, basically, like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe.
        - They don't have to put that water on the rocket. 
        - So a machine is another word for equipment that's a great.
        - Mr. Luis You said that those two elements are can be broken apart. So hydrogen and oxygen. Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart.
        - Yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something.
        - so what I would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with.
        - And then Farrah you use that word tool 
        - You're right. The astronauts and so water is very heavy on
        - Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water. 
        - Okay, so they're making statements to make you believe something
        - Why it's going to take a long time. So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now. Correct. Yeah.
        - They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case.
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - So I guess what I saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there
        - Some of our other answers. So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope. Now the Jazmin has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water 
        - which is a microscope correct.
        - And Luis I see that you wrote scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. 
        - Yes you do say yes answers. So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it. There's an exclamation point.
        - Okay, so now going back to what Luis was saying he mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in general, which is great
        - Right, okay. That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there. They can use what's on the man. 
        - Right, so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space 
        - yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool, something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there 
        - You said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated.
        - So the name of it's the Lunar orbiter then.
        - And as Jazmin was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes.
        - Oh okay Jazmin You said something like that didn't you.
        - Yeah, I was trying to get to that. Yes. You said water is is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it and ships anymore. That's good. So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there. Correct.
        - Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it. We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what. 
        - Yeah, and member Jazmin had said that they sent a small machine to investigate.
        - Yeah, because
        -  and Farrah is that right that that's what you had as well.
        - Yes, yes, the equipment was the small machine
        - Oh Jazmin okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine. Is that correct?
        - Right, that we found on the moon. So we're going to put all of this together. We know that the
        - So you know, I think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly, we may not catch all of these really fine details, I also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead.
        - yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on I wanted to say, I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks, but also um masks and suits.
        - Now some of you wrote that, um, the microscope was used to discover the water
        - Restates or summarizes student thinking in attempt to understand or support student comprehension (e.g.,  "What I'm hearing you say is that…")
        - Than you you were able to use the context of your microscope, which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces. Correct?
        - Right, so we can use it to breathe as well. And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important.
        - let's think about oxygen. Luis, you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon.
        - Chris i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that right.
        - They can drink it.
        - You said that NASA census small machine.
        - See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture. Um, let's see. Luis You said water can be. You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. So those are very important things.,
        - Right. So, you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, but it was ice right
        - Sure. Jazmin. So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine. And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail.
        - Was harrowing
        - Why the microscope is not the answer.
        - and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic
        - Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment. You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space.
        - So the two verbs here where
        - Okay Luis so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so.
        - Yeah yeah that makes sense now.
        - So.
        - Right, are all of these things, able to be done with water.
        - Yeah, they found ice using a small machine.
        - Okay, um, you know, I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024
        - I know that you get it. I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon.
        - I think you bring up this good point that, even though it might not be ready now the value might be there in the future
        - Okay, so you know that microscope is a piece of equipment and you see that in paragraph three Nice.
        - How is what Jazmin said, change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged, she said, the oil better product strategy part to get.
        - so you and Luis were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks 
        - yeah just like what Oliver just the said.
        - Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right.
        - Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important.
        - Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water.
        - so you're saying we know we need to discover something so maybe it's a good.
        - Like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle.
        - What else did we do Do you remember when we were talking before about Farrah's strategy, what else did Farrah do to make sure that she was answering the question completely.
        - You started to explain how machine was being sent.
        - yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope. that's awesome Farrah. 
        - Okay, well that's perfect Farrah. So let's go ahead and get into those answers. So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely. 
        - Yes, a small machine.
        - Jazmin. So you said NASA sent like a small machine.
        - Okay, okay, well, it's time for us to go. Um, so I want to take. Thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time.
        - and we already talked about how the microscope was used to look at the water, and we also talked about how the Lunar orbiter was used to find water.
        - I noticed that Farrah and Luis, then they also named the equipment but a different one 
        - Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again 
        - yeah yeah and and I added the words from the question to.
        - equipment.
        - Yeah, that was people used to find it.
        -  And Okay, so a strategy for this new question I would say, is to really look at the words in the question and find the words.
        - mm hmm so you and Farrah had the same idea. 
        - Uh-huh. Yeah.
        - Okay, so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match, and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about.
        - Right. So you found the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope. Nice. Luis
        - so let's take a look at some of your answers Luis and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - So Jazmin gave us a really, really awesome response and said that NASA use the small machine 
        - so you said okay well Farrah said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the.
        - Hmm. And are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money.
        - And then Jazmin you also had a great response, where you had that NASA sent a small machine.
        - So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water.
        - So we're using your background knowledge on the word.
        - Hello i'm happy to be back with you all, and I believe that we left off trying to add some more to Jazmin's response trying to strengthen it, and I know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the Lunar orbiter and I think that we, yes Luis?
        -  So back to Farrah. And I think, Oliver, you said you had the same answers her
        -  um well I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - um yeah well I also thought find, but I think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before.
        - Okay, so you talked about water and how there was craters on the moon. 
        - i'm actually Chris, you also had a really great answer to you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and I thought that came really, really close to answering the question as well.
        - And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title. So we have water we have equipment. 
        - yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - That you had just forgot to to include that in your answer, perhaps.
        - Yeah that's true very good point. So um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon. 
        - The text so that's a great response.
        - Also see where Chris, he added, kind of onto your answer. And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore.
        - Well, okay, so I didn't really read it that closely.
        - Okay, back to Farrah. Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        -  so, as I was just saying to Jazmin she said that for in the future astronauts can.
        - And so let's just keep those words in our heads, as we talk through this so we've got what type of equipment and Jazmin you mentioned a machine.
        - something you used to do something so let's use our understanding what Jazmin and Farrah gave us a tour, something we used to do something.
        - yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes, these are all really important pieces of equipment that allow NASA scientists to look at water on the moon 
        - She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things. Okay, what equipment. Did they use to discover
        - Yeah, yeah. I said that
        - Yeah, so I said that water is heavy. So it's really good.
        -  So you just told me when the scientists found the ice already, and then they couldn't see it. 
        - Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts 
        - yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time, so you're finding it for the first time, good thanks Luis in depth, those are really good words to point up 
        - Correct?
        - Well, I mean, not like everything, but I know a lot a lot a lot about space.
        - It says, you need a scientific tool.
        -  Farrah you mentioned a microscope right?
        - Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and Oliver. You said the microscope. 
        - Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer. So I'd like to dress you both at the same time. So you have the same answer As Farrah. That's great. You do use a microscope to actually see the water
        - So I'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to Jazmin.
        - Okay, let me see um well because I thought it was a microscope but then Jazmin just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit.
        - So you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - yeah i'm thinking, maybe the Lunar orbiter you know is like the MARS Rover where anybody in the Rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the Lunar orbiter is too.
        - Okay, good. So, Farrah, you made the point That maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it. 
        - Let's see here. Luis You mentioned a scientist like to use a lot of equipment. Yes?
        - yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it, or you don't know if it's there, and you uncover it that's very good yes.
        - yeah well that's sort of how I pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like I was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water.
        - There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time. 
        - yeah can I share one more thing.
        - let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to Luis's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did.
        - Even better answer So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome yes Jazmin.
        - for drinking and like Luis had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer 
        - Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to curate in the ships anymore. So I guess with your answer.
        - Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon Farrah.
        - yeah that's what I knew about equipment.
        - Jazmin and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and Farrah thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it.
        - Alright so Chris thought the same thing as Oliver 
        - So you are right in the fact that it is heavy. It takes up a lot of room. And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource. 
        - Oh yeah exactly um I like to watch a YouTube videos.
        - tool that's a good one yeah so tool, a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job Farrah and Chris, I saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment.
        - About how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe
        - and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because
        - Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - yeah so Jazmin and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you.
        - Look at all the words in the question okay.
        - What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there.
        - Farrah so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. That was your answer correct?
        - Discover and equipment. Okay, so let's take about
        - Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water
        - Okay Jazmin so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right.
        - and you know I think deb also had a similar response right death.
        - and Oliver and Farrah you guys brought up that there were those ice deposits in the craters and they used the microscope to look at that even closer to discover.
        -  deb I think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right.
        - So does anyone want to-        - actually, OK. Oh, Jesus. Sorry. One second, guys. OK. So Farrah, for example, you said that they used a microscope to look really closely, right?
        - Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon
        - And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we all need water to drink.
        - yeah so Jazmin was her answer was a little different.
        - yeah a Jazmin is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine.
        -  Just like you said Luis right?
        - And also that actually ties into Luis's experience Luis knows all about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right, even.
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Okay, so you circled equipment and you knew that a microscope was in a tool that was used for equipment. All right. 
        - Yeah, like maybe, you know, like, I guess I'm not yeah like I was thinking like, did they use that to go into craters and see like I i understand like, it's not as much water like but like, you know, if we went in the crater. Like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits.
        - yeah so you guys kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there.
        - And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now 
        - I see how you've answered the question is water valuable because right now there isn't any water there, so you said no, not yet 
        - yeah that's yeah that's what I said.
        - Hey kiddos. So looking at Question two. I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable. And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable. 
        -  So Chris just listed one, there's a couple more in there and what in your said that astronauts can drink water and stay hydrated. You can't survive with water alone right
        - Yes, and you are exactly right. They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon.
        - You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as Farrah. So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well.
        - Thanks guys alright so Farrah we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs.
        - Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right.
        - Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry all that weight if we had access to water on the moon. And that would make it valuable to us. We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead 
        - Yeah, I mean,
        - Okay. Um, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - And Jazmin, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. So we know that they sent up that small machine and Farrah, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water.
        - Oliver you agree Jazmin you agree Chris you agree, I also agree as well, that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely.
        - So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - Yeah, I had a microscope and I kind of thought. Same thing as Farrah.
        - That they need the Lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me I love that you mentioned that and then you guys brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks.
        - Excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science class and bringing it to this discussion right?
        -  yeah well, I think I got this all figured out so i'm.
        - Yeah, I
        -  so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right.
        - You got it all figured out. Luis I'm excited to hear. So let's take a look right now. We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Awesome, yes equipment right. So now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment, right?
        - Okay. Yeah, they did. They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen. They need a lot of tools. 
        - awesome comment from Farrah. So the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree, yes, that this thing was used to investigate it, but we still need the microscope to look closely at it.
        - that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah.
        - Okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job.
        - Farrah. So you put no, not for a long time. So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe. So, um,
        - Yeah, I think so too.
        - yeah right.
        - Yes, right. So if we look back, you were us used an example from the text from paragraph five, all right, or excuse me, paragraph four, and it was saying that Since water so heavy. It would take up a lot of space. And then if we didn't have to bring it. It would save some space
        - You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water. 
        - I said, equipment and I thought I circled discovered in the question for me.
        - Yes, that would be an option to maybe Luis Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read. 
        - Teacher : And Oliver, I saw that you said you circle, the same as Farrah.
        - yeah Okay, I see it.
        - Great yes, so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question  right it gives us a piece of equipment, the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something Farrah.
        - Farrah, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon.
        - You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon. Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future.
        - Yeah, and that's certainly very true. It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water. In other words, it's not available right away.
        - Okay, well, we'll go over yours too. So you mentioned a small machine.
        - Yes, and I completely agree. It will take a long time. And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but
        - And so, as Chris pointed out, they with the equipment that they use they made the craters to find the water and then Jazmin also gave us some context, saying that they use the small machine 
        - So you're thinking it was an unmanned aircraft, meaning that there was nobody on the moon, but they sent just a machine. Correct?
        - So let's look so Jazmin, you said that the small machine.
        - You would revise your revisions, so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon, using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic Is that correct.
        - Yeah, I think I agree with you, if there were astronauts, they would, they would have to be astronaut suits and oxygen tanks.
        - mm hmm Okay, so this is actually perfect for both you Farrah and Oliver since you had very similar answers.
        - And so I think that we've got two folks who said, no one person who said yes and then two people answered by talking through some of the evidence.
        - Great while Luis is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side, so Farrah and Oliver I noticed that, once again, you guys must have worked together, because you have some similar answers.
        - Yeah, they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system.
        - And while they're talking Oliver and Farrah I noticed you guys circle, the same thing is that right.
        - Farrah, you mentioned a thing called a microscope and it does something to look really closely.
        - i'm seeing a pattern here, we all like the microscope in the orbiter.
        - That was yeah that was me yeah I saw the same thing as Farrah. 
        - Chris tells us what the scientists were doing on the moon Luis knows all these different types of equipment that scientists use that maybe aren't mentioned in the text.
        - And I think someone else have listen guessing with you. Luis, is it you?
        - All right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and I want you to miss one you said I circled the same thing as Farrah.
        - Um, I mean I think so, but I okay i'm going to listen more and then I'll see if I have a question.
        - On. Yeah, well, cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money. Um, so I don't think I don't think they should spend all their money on that. Because remember, there's not even that much water, there's like four cups. You can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot.
        - Alright so Miss Farrah. I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. 
        - Find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then Luis I saw your hand go up what did you come up with Luis.
        - Yes, correct. And, and then I loved and Chris, you said that there was craters full of water on the moon.
        - So you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right.
        - Which one is right, then the microscope or Jazmin's?
        - So Chris so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon.
        - Which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon, just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there.
        - and I noticed in Farrah knows i'm explanation, she said, a scientific.
        - Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right
        - Okay, so you have identify a bit I identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by, it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration.
        - And you read that in the text, that's fine. Water is heavy.
        - straight from the text.
        - Cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me.
        - Yeah, so, Farrah, you talked about the microscope.
        - Awesome. Thank you. And Oliver your response was just comparing to Farrah is which was a great point. She was absolutely correct. 
        - Yeah, no, Jazmin, got it. Also, it's also good. Good answer. So there was a small machine. And it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right
        - Oliver, about the investigators, right and Farrah about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and Luis about all the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use, 
        - Well, yeah.
        - I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space. So we need oxygen.
        - yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different.
        - Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks.
        - Right, exactly. So what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water
        - Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine to go get that water.
        - yeah we always work together.
        - And Jazmin has also identified a benefit so let's hear what Jazmin had to say.
        - Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one.
        - Yeah, I knew I was looking for equipment and so that's why I found the microscope.
        - let's see so your answer you revised answer Luis was that scientists found is using a small machine Is that correct.
        - Farrah, you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, correct?
        - yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it
        - Paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right.
        - So just to remind everyone for equipment, we have a tool, a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment.
        - So there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have
        - And then, it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools, who may just think that it was a scientific tool, the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but.
        - Okay, very good. So where we're thinking about how small the water is. 
        - but let's just go back to the first thing you said so, you said that Oh yes, the Lunar orbiter is looking for the ice deposits on the moon, so do you agree or disagree with what Oliver said.
        - I want to combine Chris to answer with Luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the Lunar orbiter was a Chris was 100% correct when he said it's there to investigate right.
        - That is Farrah and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a Oliver.
        - What it but you yeah but you say they wouldn't have to carry it on ships anymore.
        - So, Jazmin you answered with NASA send a small machine. So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine.
        - Water yeah that's that makes water so um Chris said that scientists found creators, full of water on moon right is that what you read hi Chris.
        -  Okay, so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon. 
        - And Farrah. I noticed that in your response. You actually talked about microscopes, which help the scientists to see things closer, is that, sure, you said that right in your response.
        - Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else Jazmin?
        - So yeah, we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon, are there any other tools
        -  So we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much. So the astronauts can what with it.
        - You're left with hydrogen and oxygen.
        - so um Farrah I saw I know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and I love that you notice that, from what are one of the other paragraphs, the third paragraph right, it was Farrah and Oliver you guys found that in the third paragraph yeah?
        - Yes, so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen, Luis that's very true that is good observation.
        - Yes, perfect so ice is water. now in the microscope part this is kind of what Farrah and Oliver were pointing out 
        - and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this.
        - Yes, yes, it's so you are correct. Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable. Just because we don't really have anybody there but
        - Now, I noticed that Farrah and Oliver noticed that there is they said that there's not any evidence right and then Chris Jazmin and Luis did say that there is some evidence. Luis What did you have to say.
        - Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic. Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads. The question is this.
        - Okay, so it's really, really, really, really, really, really small. We can't see it with our
        - And it's the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon, so I think that's a great full answer Farrah and Oliver that's awesome
        - cool so we've had a couple of comments from you about equipment we've had scientists use a lot of equipment and then we have scientists found the ice using a small machine.
        - As well. So I read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base. And I guess if that was true.
        - yeah because I, I know that a tool is something that you used to do with thing, and I know equipment is something that you used to do a thing to.
        - yeah that's great so i'm glad that we have some agreement so so so far, the words that we've talked about our equipment and discover and water on the moon.
        - Needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right. What about you, Demi
        - Okay, I can do that.  it's me Oliver. Okay, so, um, so like there's water on the moon.
        - Teacher : Awesome and Chris. I saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks.
        - Perfect, perfect. So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine
        - yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters, they're full of water.
        -  So I noticed that Jazmin told me She was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything. It's not specific to the text right
        - Oh yeah um before we keep going um I want to let you know actually it's time for us to go.
        - Jazmin has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and
        - Okay, think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration.
        - Right. So, very good, very good. So we know Chris oh sorry Oliver and Farrah, let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon. Right?
        - Exactly Luis and um I think what your answer focused on more of is what they could do with the water once they discover it right like there was an interesting video I saw.
        - Seemed to be very strong you you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and that you need 
        - So you thought about Jazmin's answer and then
        - Yeah. And so if you look back, you found your answer in paragraph four, and it says for example future future astronauts could drink this water.
        - whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters.
        - Nice so are you also having the same ideas Farrah where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym.
        - Am I correct Chris is that you're thinking
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you and I wanted to thank you, particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking.
        - Yeah, exactly. You can't go to the Mon without an oxygen tank.
        - You think it's a microscope.
        - Oliver and Farrah I see that you guys had a similar answer right Farrah, you said that you i'm in your answer you talked about a microscope as a scientific tool to look really closely and they've used to that you circled the same thing, for your.
        - Yes. And so, Chris do you notice what Jazmin just said. She said the machine that discovered was a small machine, right.
        - And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you.
        - You are so close. And I love how you guys are trying to think about this. So let me help you with this. Okay. You're telling me that I can split. Both of these things up.
        - Okay, so let's look at your answers Jazmin so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right.
        - okay. So when I looked at was, I was thinking, okay, so what equipment did they use to discover the water right, so what I saw was like microscope. I thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic
        - yeah yeah we pick that same one.
        - so Jazmin thought that it could be valuable
        - Thank you. Yes, that is another meaningful valuable important or something worth worth. Well, yes. So we need to find information from the text that is convincing to support Our answer of water on the moon being valuable, 
        - Very true. So, so we know that ice is the water. We know that the water that we find is very small. Okay, so that's very good. We're going to keep that in the back of our brains. 
        - Farrah and Oliver. I see.That you had originally thought maybe the water isn't going to be that useful.
        -  and so Luis You mentioned that you can see water puddles.
        - Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space. So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space. Does that make sense?
        - Okay, so very good, so this is about you found the part in the text right about them locating the craters and that's the location right that's where was this water right but.
        - So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink. And as the fuel if they break it into two parts. So that was two of the ways that they could use it. 
        - So it me and Chris had some good ideas, then, how come we're in this group.
        - yeah I'll go yeah I thought it was the microscope um cuz that's That was the well yeah I don't know if it's a machine either 
        - One question for you guys. So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in Luis You had mentioned equipment they had been used
        - Farrah you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right.
        - So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?
        - And Farrah told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it.
        - That is very true. Yes, water is heavy. So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship. They could have room for other things. So that is very good thinking, 
        - They sure do.
        - So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was
        -  so we know that Jazmin said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin 
        - Oh OK, so the part about equipment, I agree, I think that is a key part of the question that we might need to dig into to figure out the answers we need to go back to the article.
        - awesome okay so Farrah looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so.
        - Yeah you and Luis both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts.
        - And so Luis why don't we actually start with you, I noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that right.
        - You can do some cool stuff with it and Chris actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it
        -  um well I just I realized it's time for us to go now, but thank you for taking the time to work with us.
        - So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope Chris looked
        - I'm really closely at the water
- intent: r310.1
  examples: |
        - And Luis I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon.
        - I do agree that it does say other equipment that. Thank you 
        - But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it. so I love it you like expanded that an understatement. That was good.
        - Where we found that from is from outside now. So that's what's called like texts to real world connections. So that's a really good skill to have. 
        - Okay. And that's, that's very good. I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it. Um,
        - Right. So if you use one before. And some of your science classes, maybe
        - Sounds good. OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you guys used in your responses and that's amazing. And you did a really good job with that. 
        - Okay yeah I can look more closely and see what what else is going on, because yeah I was just connecting to what I already do, but I think I see what you're saying like I need to I need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well, right now.
        -  I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space.
        - Yeah, exactly. That was a great thought process, putting those two together. Okay so convincing evidence and valuable.
        - but I see how you came to your conclusion.
        - You do a great job of talking about the question. So you obviously understand the question. As far as that goes. .
        - It's great How you even expanded your thinking just now.
        - And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer. That's actually very well done, 
        - that's a great point Farrah. 
        - um that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer.
        - So, so if I say i'm NASA send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate.
        - Good job, they're reading into that.
        - Yeah, that makes complete and total sense. That was a good job connecting the dots there. Well done.
        - I'm really glad that you that this group was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences. That's a really good skill to be able to have.
        - Excellent Reading. You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money. So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable. 
        - Jazmin, your response was really awesome. I love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about NASA and that they sent a small machine. 
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking too. so awesome job using evidence from the text as well. 
        - So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice. that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly.
        - yeah Luis that's awesome background knowledge. thank you for bringing that background knowledge so.
        - I was wondering why, my answer the question. My answer was wrong. You know why I was in the group, it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer.
        - I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water. 
        - Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space. So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before.
        - i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills Chris. so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay.
        - That is a good answer, because that is part of the answer. 
        - Great well, I really appreciate how you guys chose to look for a piece of equipment.
        - Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her. That's a really great skill.
        - Um, so me. Well, I actually have a question. I was not sure. Like I was thinking a lot about it and I still don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - um I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation. 
        - yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use. that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your.
        - Right. There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon. That's a very good thing to point out. That's very smart. 
        - It talks about specific things that the question asks.
        - ooh really great detail with your Farrah. I loved how you did all those three steps right. you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does.
        - Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but.
        - So again, we're just going to that. That's true. So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. that's important.
        - Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there.
        - Okay, I understand that. Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer.
        - So I can see where you would say microscope oh go ahead.
        - So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, Oliver.
        - yeah I like how your second half, got a little bit more specific after our conversation 
        - let's look at the last sentence, because I like what Farrah brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money.
        - That is true. Farrah, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer. That's a really good strategy.
        - That's a good way of thinking about it, Jazmin.
        - Teacher : Right, so I could see where that would get confusing.
        - So I see that you got your answer from the first paragraph.
        - yeah so Oliver I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
        - Yes, great. I really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question. Um, so
        - Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer. So try to think about
        - Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration.
        - So you found that directly in the text. That's really good.
        - yeah so thank you yeah so I like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water um and great.
        - Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better.
        - They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from, 
        - Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from 
        - It makes sense. So he needs to say like
        - That is true. Very good. They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water, 
        - And yet, I just wanted to say. And we have to match the lunch. I just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular.
        - Good. I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know.
        - So I appreciate you looking at your
        - So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable. Now, but in the future. It would be 
        - Very good. Chris. I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us. He did a really good job.
        - I love that. So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive.
        - Okay, well, you know, good job. Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff, 
        - awesome so I saw in your answer Luis that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon
        - And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing 
        - Because that has the words we were just talking about. So that was just the right place to look for that. And you did find some evidence, didn't you
        - Jazmin that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon.
        - Well, that's okay. Even if it's not valuable right now. Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future. And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
        - That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out. But when we look back at the question.
        - Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see. 
        - Farrah and Oliver. I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence.
        - I love love love that you brought up that example that's that's what's called an analogy, and it is a great analogy Oliver.
        - That's a very good point. So you could circle convincing evidence together. Yeah, that's a great idea. 
        - All right, let's see, when you guys are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look. 
        - And I'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence  
        - makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that 
        - And I went to NASA. So I know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits.
        - Okay, so we'll keep going. And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it.
        - Great. I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine. 
        - That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it 
        - To use our background knowledge like Luis used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right. We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important.
        - yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and
        - So way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now.
        - So yes, that's another great example of convincing evidence
        - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well.
        - Using the text to help support your answers, 
        - Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question.
        - That's really good. You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like Luis
        - Very good. Jazmin, and that was perfect. And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion.
        - And so you, you do have a good convincing Answer right there.
        - Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer. And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right.
        - I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took, 
        - Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you Farrah and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern
        - And she couldn't when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was. I like how you went back to your text and re read the information
        - I'll share. Can I share
        - Ya so I circled water on the moon oh and also discover.
        - Awesome, but I have one question. Um like, why is my it's because we're all here to like work on it together. Like what, why is my answer, not quite right.
        - That is correct. And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer.
        - But I think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question.
        - yeah so I also see the Lunar orbiter in paragraph two 
        - and I really value how, in your answer you guys directly talked about a piece of equipment 
        - that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is.
        - Oh, great. So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon, 
        - Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Yeah, I like it. You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer.
        - That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point.
        - I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text.
        - I said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - And so I love that y'all are all thinking about the story and are using
        - Okay, excellent. And I love how you pull that answer for number two.
        - Well, I was just gonna say that I think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool.
        - yeah um okay what he did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - And I spoke to Oliver. So he justified his answer. 
        - yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay.
        - And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article. 
        - Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that.
        - Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting 
        - Sure sounds great.
        - And I just like that. That was your example.
        - I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there.
        - Um, yeah. So I would say, I guess it was sort of similar, but basically what I would say like in my own words. Is that like
        - Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question.
        - Good so Chris and Farrah you both found specific information for the text so that is great 
        - And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good.
        - ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right
        - Okay. Um, so I can see Chris I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source.
        - Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question. 
        - Chris, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well. I like that you expanded your thinking. 
        - mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article um, 
        -  so Luis used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is.
        - So you guys are given really good details for that.
        - Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there 
        - Absolutely. The water before it's broken apart can be drunk by astronauts good observation there from the text and the usefulness for oxygen and hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel here. Luis That was, that was a great find in the text.
        - Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete. 
        - Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things. 
        - Oliver, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer. That there isn't much water on the moon.
        -  yeah I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me Chris that are really, really great job.
        - yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest.
        - it's in the text right you're exactly right Jazmin great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm.
        - Good. I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us. Yes Oliver. 
        - And is my answer-        - did I get it right when I said that the water is heavy, so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore?
        - Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew. 
        - Um so Farrah I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading. You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where.
        - Yeah. Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence. You did a good job.
        - Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text. I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that. That was very good.
        - Oh yeah, you're totally need it and like I i could see that, like, maybe it would be maybe valuable, but
        - Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen. 
        - So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon.
        - awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources, 
        - Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,
        - And Jazmin that answer was really great. You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text.
        - Oh, oh, okay. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater.
        - and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so Luis why don't I just start off with you.
        - Answer is not wrong. And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts. Okay, so, um, I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words.
        - Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy. And it takes up a lot of space.
        - One nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that I was.
        - Oh, oh teacher you're frozen, can you see me and hear me.
        - That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for 
        - yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science class i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class.
        - Yes, that is true. I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you. 
        - Yes, very good. I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer. 
        - I like that you found relationship between the words 
        - I really like that answer. I like that you gave reason to why you think that um.
        - Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it. 
        - Thank you so much for sharing your responses to me.  I want to particularly point out, Farrah and Jazmin's responses you guys did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use. 
        - So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is. It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things. 
        - The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you guys use textual evidence in the text um, but how do you think
        - amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you guys have collaborated on.
        - so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,
        - I think I just, I'm still a little confused.
        - Teacher : so I could see you, how you got confused there.
        - So both of you found your answers somewhere in the text, you were, it was clear that you read the text and I really love that you were looking at the text, you definitely read it, or at least looked at it, which is great.
        - You are absolutely right. And I really like that you brought up that point.
        - And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his
        - I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important. Good job.
        - So that's what you did. You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted. 
        - Okay Jazmin I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move, 
        - I pointed out, Farrah, and Jazmin, both of you had done a really good job from the beginning. Naming the exact specific examples of equipment.
        - Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope?
        - Exactly. That's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build it will take a lot of what in order to get that process going. 
        - I love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool.
        - Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is.
        - And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great. It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that
        - Okay, I think that's a great strategy that you're using so yeah, so I think that is an important part of the question, what blah blah blah like does that or what equipment and then what are we looking for with the equipment.
        -  yeah exactly it's all about the water.
        - You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer. And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that.
        - I see. So I can definitely see where Chris got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk. The ice is found in the crater.
        - awesome So yes, that included the important details.
        - Oh, it's time for us to go to lunch. I'm so sorry. This was really fun class.
        - Yes, that was very good. And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence. That's awesome. 
        -  But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated. I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
        - And you were able to find that in the text good job.
        - I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is
        - I love, how you comprehend the reading so well 
        - yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing all this thoughts great 
        - That is a very good answer. You remember from your text and you're elaborated by restating the question. Thank you. Chris, did you want to add something.
        - Oh yeah that's a good idea.
        - that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand.
        - I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, Jazmin.
        - And that's a really great question that's what I bought to Farrah, but when I read about the.
        - Oh, I think to answer my question.
        - So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope. 
        - Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver all did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great. 
        - Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right.
        - Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,
        - Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment 
        - More evidence?
        - Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response Jazmin I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end.
        - But I guess I don't understand why.
        - Of the water and how the water could be used 
        - They sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate 
        - I think i'm I see how you got to your answer
        - So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it
        - OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly.
        - Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your.
        - Absolutely yeah no, these are all great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece
        - hmm I definitely understood that um you were looking for different
        - that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer. 
        - Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you guys read the reading and understood it. 
        - Okay. So Deb. I love that you've used your listening skill and you listen to Farrahs answer.
        -  I like your revised answer and that you guys work so well together.
        - I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer.
        - Great and then Luis you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks.
        - I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,
        - Yeah, absolutely. And even I value all that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing.
        - Thank you, Luis. Luis That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text. 
        - Absolutely. And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water.
        - Okay. And I like that you use that wording scientific tool. 
        - All right, perfect. Farrah, your answer was really awesome. I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific. And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article.
        - Um, yeah. So I just basically was just thinking also that
        -  oh yeah I guess not.
        - That was actually really good. One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things. See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good. We do use that in science class, but
        - You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job, 
        - Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure. It's always a great idea. 
        - I guess it would be like how Luis said where you do split it.
        - um so, unfortunately.
        - he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text.
        - Good to look really closely. So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence.
        - and I love that you guys are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help.
        - And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water.
        - I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead.
        - awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent Chris go right ahead.
        - Yeah, so I don't know why why I'm here. Honestly, cause I gave an answer from the text. 
        - Chris I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with.
        - Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here. I kind of agree because like
        - Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer. And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable.
        - How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you guys. 
        - Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text. So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater. That's great.
        - No need to feel bad. So you. I love that you went and use a specific example from the text, right, that was
        - Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw all of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned. 
        - And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary, 
        - You're, you're correct. And I'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct. Thank you. Farrah.
        - I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text.
        - Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but.
        - Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think.
        - Nice yeah so thank you so you're right, it is equipment, which is what we're looking for and you found it in the third paragraph I like I use the text.
        - um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to.
        - Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small.
        - yeah sorry teacher it wasn't that it was a machine, I guess, my science teacher might see that it is, but I was looking for equipment.
        - yeah I love, how you summarize that are Chris 
        - Because I was looking for the keywords equipment oh discover water on the moon.
        - yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but.
        - you summarize very well okay and about the craters. Okay. You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon. Right?
        -  I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um.
        - Okay, Deb, I just want to say I really love that you listened to Farrah and listening is such an important skill as a student.
        - Yeah, we'll do that.
        - And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
        - yeah so I definitely like the way that you're going about this about answering this question is you're thinking about equipment and they're thinking about equipment us to discover or find or look for the water.
        - That's right, yeah. But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better. It gives us almost like a little step ahead.
        - That's a really good point.
        - That was wonderful thinking. 
        - So a microscope is a type of equipment. It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article. So that's great that you were able to point that out. 
        - Good, good. Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on, 
        - wasn't a question teacher, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what I wanted to say thank you for.
        - Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon.
        - One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section. Water is a valuable resource right
        - Very good. Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you guys did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text .
        - awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three.
        - yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools, so that was a great revision.
        - Great answer. Jazmin. I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive.
        - And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as Farrah. Your thought process is a lot deeper as well.
        - Right. Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right Farrah.
        - Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing.
        - And thank you Jazmin for explaining your answer and using the text really well.
        - awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response.
        - Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my
        - Well, one. Thank you very much for listening. Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart. What I said there. So I appreciate that. That was very good.
        - is really, really nice way to phrase that.
        - So I think that you and Chris and Luis All said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable. So I think that you justified your answer and
        - because sometimes readers, even if they don't have all the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like. Yeah, Oliver. 
        - Okay, that's great evidence to support it. 
        - And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing.
        - You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,
        - awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use. scientists definitely use microscopes. That was a good connection.
        - Okay. And you're right. That's great. You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope.
        - Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, Farrah, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water
        - Very good. That's absolutely right. And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information
        - Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it. 
        - that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the class and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class.
        - yeah I was thinking about equipment, since a circle that in the text and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job. 
        - but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text. So I like that answer.
        - Okay. I think my answer. I chose I'm valuable. It's important one.
        - yeah I also I can really picture it because I went to NASA and I found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Um, I think we all had our reasons and justified our reason. So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable. You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right.
        - Well I don't understand why my answer's wrong.
        - Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great.
        - awesome so I see what you did, 
        - I love that you brought in that background knowledge Luis that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge.
        - That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that.
        - Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience.
        - um yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear.
        -  and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer.
        - i'm sorry teacher, but I was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go on, but I did want to say thank you for how are you i'm kept asking our questions to everybody and took time to explain.
        - yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text, 
        - That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own 
        - Um, yeah, I was really interested in seeing like how they found the water they were trying to, like, you know what I mean, like how they manage to look for it.
        - I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?
        - Great. Yeah, exactly.
        - So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like Luis I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions.
        - I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon. You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?
        - um which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there.
        - A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective. 
        - And it's just another piece about, like, I guess, like the when Chris was saying this stuff about the water play. You know what I mean like this, this, this, do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our, our speech like RP
        - It is, I see how you mean that connection 
        - They need things to even be in space. I understand.
        - Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting 
        - So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here 
        - Good. You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there. 
        - That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon. 
        - Oliver you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable.
        -  I think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space.
        - I like that answer. Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading. Okay.
        - Actually
        - You all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that. 
        - Absolutely. You have put the steps together very well in your brain.
        - answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's.
        - you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but.
        - I don't
        - Yeah, so I see both of your points. 
        - I like how you took your answer correctly from the text. It's great to read our answers directly in the text.
        - You give really good strong details on that very specific part
        - awesome great and I love how you're all looking back at the text 
        - Oh really great point Farrah Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does.
        - that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there Oliver that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it.
        - I like your thinking that is awesome. You use details from our text to support your thinking. So, that's awesome. 
        - that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading
        - Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question. It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon.
        - Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine. So you're in the ballpark. So you found the equipment.
        -  I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering Chris.
        - Um, excuse me.
        - I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information 
        - Yeah. Okay, I think I'm I think if I if I just read it more carefully. Next time I maybe I could find the right answer.
        - Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because 
        - Right okay good, so I, like all of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text and use your best work to get to where you are.
        - So you guys did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
        - Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer. That is great. Okay. 
        - I love that Farrah, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if
        - So Farrah you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is.
        - Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest.
        - Thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer. So you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding. Thank you for that Jazmin.
        -  but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes Oliver. 
        - That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good.
        - So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you. You know that answer makes perfect sense.
        -  I like that you use that word scientific tool. Great, great job there,
        - Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text. But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic.
        - Let me look at it.
        - Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing Luis is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge.
        - That is very, very, very good. Jazmin and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer.
        - It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean.
        - Yes. And that is correct. And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction.
        - that's a great point 
        - Great, that's, that's really good Chris. So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found. First of all, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail.
        - I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful.
        - Yes, so Luis I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of 
        - Right. So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon.
        - And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers.
        - um you guys located the information in the text very, very well um
        - And I was very impressed about how everyone took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking. Alright, so let's first look at the question again.
        - For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question.
        - did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing.
        - Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that. So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet. 
        -  I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did 
        - So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?
        - that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that
        - Nice, I, like the way that you're using the strategy to kind of pull apart the important parts of the question 
        - That is true. You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence. 
        - I definitely can see how you would find it confusing. 
        - You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to.
        - So that is a great response. i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool.
        - You do, Luis. And so, so while you're here. Let me talk to you and Chris. So I like that you found some details in the article.
        - And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing.
        - Mm hmm. Great. So you have text evidence from the text. That's great. 
        - Great job pulling that out of the text 
        - But you used great academic vocab in your response. 
        - I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence.
        -  Wow, Jazmin. Good job. Looking back at the text and adding more detail. 
        - yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it all right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead.
        - yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of.
        - She used like a Luis use that his dad was an astronaut. Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon. You made a connection a detective.
        - Thank you. That was that's a much more specific detailed answer.
        - Very good. And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it.
        - Good. I see where you're going with that. And it is a small machine, 
        - So you guys are all given really good details.
        - that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point
        - You um I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and.
        - Yeah, yeah, you're right. Good. And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer. That's awesome. I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
        - Luis, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback. So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good, 
        - Alright that's great. I like you added all that in there and accessed your background knowledge um.
        - Okay, I love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses 
        - awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used.
        - OK, OK, OK, I can do that.
        - And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment, 
        - Absolutely. Very good. Farrah. I like your use of detail there. I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in. I think that's very good.
        - Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great. I love that.
        - Yes, they could use the microscope after they found it to study it. That's very good deduction there. I like what you did there, Oliver.
        - Well, I appreciate that. I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that. And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
        - The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment.
        - Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details
        - yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used.
        - Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story.
        - Awesome. Okay. So you guys have all shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good. I really liked that you guys tried to pull your evidence from the text.
        - So my answer is right?
        - Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county all messed up if you know what I mean well.
        - Yes, exactly. I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section. So, good job there Oliveron are deaf. Sorry.
        - And Farrah I was curious with your response. I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope.
        - and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one.
        - Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way
        - that's a great point Farrah, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky.
        - Okay, so I think that you guys did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter.
        - yeah I understand I understand your confusion 
        - It was a right answer. That was one of our right answers. And I appreciate that answer. You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text
        - I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon.
        - And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope. Ok? Great job. 
        - Actually, I have a question. So if it sounds like then that we needed to use the microscope, but so is my answer wrong. Like, did they not use the small machine?
        - But you had a you had another good piece of evidence.
        - Oh, what a nice way to explain that. 
        - Okay, I understand. And I see why you would say that, 
        - And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like Chris is saying.
        - Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
        - You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question. Which is great and you all refer back to the text.
        - So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific. It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So um Jazmin what you did was you definitely got the answer correct. right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon
        - awesome well, I really enjoyed your response Luis because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and.
        - I do understand what you mean. And I really appreciate you explaining your answer.
        - And I like that you really pulled that from the text. 
        - yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking Chris yes.
        - Yeah, I really appreciate appreciate that you were looking carefully at the question and exactly the words is equipment.
        - So just using that one sentence Oliver and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon.
        - awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me Jazmin
        - I see where you get that answer, 
        - Good. I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind all that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable. 
        - Yes, thank you, that is.
        - And they did. That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer. 
        - So I love, how you summarize the article Chris.
        - Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine. So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use. And she answers NASA sent a small machine. 
        - yeah Okay, so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover.
        - That makes sense, thank you.
        - What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence. 
        - You are good. You are good. I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. That's exactly right.
        - Yes, Luis I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge
        - yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
        - Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great.
        - Affirms student by recognizing their perspective (e.g., "Nice work using the passage to…")
        - Yeah great, so I think Jazmin I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine
        - And you use that to make a complete answer. I love your answer. He told us what equipment they use and what it was called. Exactly. And what it did was it three great things. Thank you for that. That was awesome.
        - So I strength so far from that was, um, you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good. 
        - Gotcha, well we have to go to Lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. And particularly, I wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that I was because I was thinking about it, but I guess I didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer. That was really cool.
        - yeah I think so that you gotta do what.
        - I agree with you. I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready. Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there.
        - Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text 
        - Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question 
        - Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found
        - Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great.
        - Yeah, that's great. Now you you've built on your response. And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response. Nice work. Um, and
        - Excellent, excellent. Thank you. I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see. Yes, Jazmin.
        - yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text.
        - Yes, I see how you found found you got to that.
        - Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope.
        - That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections. good job Chris.
        - Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits.
        - Okay okay. 
        - um yeah Okay, I see what you're saying 
        - Right. You're right. That is that is a great piece of text evidence. 
        - Okay, great. I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from.
        - Yeah, well I just said what I said before, because like something I don't want first, like if I had gone. First, I would have said microscope, but she had already saw that. So I just said what I saw.
        - Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy.
        - Okay. I like how you're making that connection.
        - Great so I love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment, we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer, that is a great job.
        - Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job Luis However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so.
        - yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, all right, you did you did either disappear job excellent.
        - Right, I really like that, just like Luis, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text.
        - It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you.
        - that's great Farrah and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic. And Oliver you have your hand raised before.
        - Good. I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question. 
        - and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer. They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did. Thank you. Jazmin.
        - yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay um the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK.
        -  so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools.
        - Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and Jazmin so.
        - Oh, oh, okay, well then why
        - And then Chris. So what you said related to the text really well. You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text. So it was a great response.
        - yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff 
        - I love that. And I love how just like Luis You're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important.
        - Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that
        - Right, well, and I love that you guys were able to close your eyes and see that and help you Oliverelop that. Miss Jazmin?
        - Okay, that's, that's great. And so at the heart of your answer there. I think you've got the main idea. We found some water on the moon. And that's really exciting. So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
        - Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if.
        - Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text.
        - Mm hmm. They do say that and that's great text evidence to use. They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question. 
        - Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that, 
        - Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that. So,
        - Awesome. And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good. Um, Chris.
        - Okay, I'll read it, but I guess that's why I was confused because I felt like you know I did better this time. And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six.
        - yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any 
        - I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it. 
        - that is very good job. Luis you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly.
        - On so it's our it's time for us to goal right now, but I wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about
        - I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer.
        - No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know.
        -  Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer. And that is a great answer, our passage. 
        - Exactly. Very good. And Nice job, looking back at the text.
        - awesome, and so what I really like about what you said Jazmin is this word machine that you mentioned, 
        - yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph, and I understand where you would get that answer, 
        - A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um Farrah and Jazmin you guys really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate.
        - Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use. Thank you for that. That's a some awesome prior knowledge Luis.
        - I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that.
        - And then for Chris and Jazmin I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part.
        - is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job.
        - No problem. I like that you use the background information, though, Chris, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more
        - So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong. So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer.
        - Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before.
        - Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with Chris, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy
        - That's exactly right. But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good. Farrah. What about you,
        - Now let's see some other answers Jazmin. I really liked that you noticed that NASA had sent a small machine.
        - now let's take deeper Jazmin I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon.
        - Hello everyone, I just want to say thank you so much for sharing your answers with me, I can tell by everything that you guys put down that you really understood this passage and done a great job looking in the text, for your answers Luis.
        - I found this somewhere, let me see because I thought I underlined it.
        - yeah it's so cool.
        -  On i'm sorry but it's time for us to go.
        - Yeah. Thank you for pointing that out, Chris.
        - You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said.
        - And I wanted to say, Oliver. I loved in your first answer that you agreed with Farrah, because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking. And that's really important and learning. But I did. I like your second answer better because you put it in your own words.
        - That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you.
        - Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because.
        - Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen.
        - Well, I was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and I changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background. Now even though I know that, like they use lots of other stuff.
        - That's great. I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from.
        - awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space.
        - I love it. Jazmin. That is a great answer. And thank you so much for using that sentence starter.
        - And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be.
        - Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as Farrah, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking
        - Good. I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information. Good job. 
        - Right. I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit. Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits. 
        - You do a great your answers. Great. Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated. You can't survive without water. So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence. 
        - Right. They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome.
        - I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you guys interpreted interpreted the reading, 
        - by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,
        - Well, how my knowledge relates-        - how my knowledge relates to the question and the story. Well, I mean, so I know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon. So that part, I feel like that's how my knowledge relates because I know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon.
        - Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um.
        - yeah it does seem like that would be really important. um that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that. 
        - Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable.
        - Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters. 
        - Water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting are getting it out of the polar craters making this planet tickle at all, so they don't even know how to get the water out.
        - So Farrah, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true. Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool.
        - So that's a great job be able to identify what that means. 
        - So my answer was sort of right and sort of wrong. Like when I said like NASA used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right, because I didn't say orbiters right?
        - and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um.
        - mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good.
        - I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense 
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter. Great job, looking back at the text. Thank you for that.
        - And it also does say in here in the third paragraph. I'm and I see where Farrah could have got her answer. It says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely.
        - mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water. Awesome you got that right from the passage, 
        - got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you all really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer. Great job. 
        - That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information Chris that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job.
        - Yeah, in a science lab.
        - Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because.
        - Great yeah and Farrah when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned.
        - But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also
        - So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm.
        - Awesome. Luis, I know that you were talking about all your knowledge. And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that. 
        - awesome so Farrah and Oliver get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points.
        - I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and Jazmin were able to look specifically in the text. And that's a good skill. 
        - All right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words
        - So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good. 
        - guys it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously.
        - Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff. That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space.
        - That's exactly right. So like you said your answer. Jazmin, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why. Okay. And it looks like you've done that in your answer. So great job. Farrah?
        - Oh yeah i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and and we have to go to lunch and i'm really bummed because I feel like we're just getting to the park but.
        - Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon.
        - Yeah, I really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question. You really gave us the evidence you found in a text, the importance of water. 
        - Do you think it's a good investment um I thought I thought your answer was great because, like.
        - I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text. That would be easy for you to sign and come back to. 
        - That's a good question.
        - i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was.
        - Farrah. Thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said, it seems like you're asking, How come you didn't get full credit for your answer. I like that you gave a specific tool.
        - Our teacher, I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I did want to say that I, I appreciate how you kept asking us questions you know to like think about.
        - i'm not really um but I guess i'd caught up circle, the word scientists, because if there are scientists on the moon, they have oxygen tanks.
        - Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track, 
        - so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that.
        - Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you.
        - Chris, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out. Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true. And I'm really proud of you for finding that.
        - Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes. So right after that the paragraph. We want to be in, you're exactly right. 
        - Okay, so just like Luis I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be
        - Farrah your response is actually really good. I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
        - Um, yeah. So I have the same answer. I Farrah, so I thought it was the microscope, and I guess for me I guess it was kind of the same thing. I figured, when I read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that I saw like when I was reading. So I guess that could be the only answer.
        - Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters. I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question.
        - That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um.
        - You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely.
        - what I would really like you to do, though. And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion. 
        - I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
        - It was the right answer, but I like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details. So you weren't wrong, but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was
        - I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water
        - Just not a great connection. 
        - Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part.
        - They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two.
        - But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool.
        - Yeah, yeah, that's where I got mine from
        - Very good. I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good.
        - Good, I agree that they're not ready. So, you made a really important
        - Yeah, I'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words, you know,
        - You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right, 
        - That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem
        - i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock.
        - Miss Jennifer
        - but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation.
        - I love that you cited where you found it in the text
        - Locating this into the second paragraph.
        - I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used. 
        - um so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of.
        - So I like how in your answer. Chris, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon.
        - You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you.
        - Great job, Deb. I loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better.
        - yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon.
        - I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together.
        - Oh, Farrah. I see how you got that answer. I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use. 
        -  and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read, 
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking there
        - Okay, that's good. Good thinking, because we are talking about water. We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more. 
        - Okay. Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us. So let's see.
        - I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed.
        - So great job, guys. I like how everyone is reading their text and finding the details in the reading. Yes, Jazmin.
        - awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks .
        - So I can add a bit of background info here. Um, so, Luis Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space.
        - Answer and asking why
        - You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great.
        - you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely. So that would make sense. Right.
        - Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer.
        - Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I picked it from part two, because it says they use the machine to investigate and I thought that sounded kind of close to the question.
        - Okay, looking for equipment. Gotcha.
        - lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that 
        - I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes Chris.
        - Good. You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good. All right. And you also found that they both talked about water. Now what did the question ask us to find about water.
        - Yeah, yeah, that's that makes sense. Yeah.
        - Yeah, exactly. It's because our microscope is equipment. It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small.
        - But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking.
        - But you use great academic knowledge.nd great academic vocab in your response. 
        - Oh, even you bring up a really great point. I saw that you use your background information when you
- intent: r410.1
  examples: |
        - I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money. But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment. The question was, is water valueable.
        - Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water?
        - Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then Jazmin for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right.
        - But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is.
        - But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. so my suggestion sorry.
        - yeah well because that was my answer it first about the craters.
        - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon. so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using. 
        - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it.
        - Okay so you can't tell that I need more evidence or I have enough evidence right cuz I pulled it from the story.
        - Oh, oh, okay, okay, so I get it. Like, I know that that's the answer, like the lunar orbiter is the answer. But, but I thought that I had the right answer you know, because I talked about the water in my answer about like how they they found the water because I know that, you know, to discover stuff means to find stuff.
        - Well, you do need a microscope to look really closely, but this question is, we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So, so I
        - The question asked for you to talk about the equipment. So when you guys are. This is for everybody, not just Chris, when you are talking about.
        - They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space. So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space.
        - Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one. so, while they do use those equipment. that's not what we're looking for for this question
        - So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question, we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon 
        - And the question I think we need to be a little more specific. Right.
        - we're talking about the equipment. so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment.
        - Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use.
        - What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so.
        - Okay, they do use oxygen tanks.
        - So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us
        - Yes, the water is an overload along a passage. But my concern is other students and they circle. The key words like equipment do agree.
        - But, that doesn't truly answer the question. 
        - But yes, Chris, you are correct, that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use that. for this particular question. It was the equipment that they used to discover water.
        - But I think you may be confused on the question, 
        - Oh, OK. OK, gotcha.
        - That is true and it's basically just what I told Chris, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment. so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water. 
        - That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used 
        - Farrah. I'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly. you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - So they can be types of tools, yes. you know equipment gear all those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things. we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right.
        - So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking.
        - Also, Luis, your question or your answer Had to do with equipment as well. But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main
        - And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found 
        - Well, I guess it's answering the question because well it is valuable right? like it's really valuable that um that they have like.
        - So they use the microscope. microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water. But did they discover the water with the microscope?
        - Yes, so the water they found, you would use a microscope to study it, but it doesn't explain how they found the water
        - Right. And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it. But the question is actually specifically pointing toward What's the potential value. 
        - Okay, that that actually makes that makes a lot of sense, thank you.
        - Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope.
        - So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,
        - Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect. You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question. Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up.
        - yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked.
        - A little bit. But for this specific question. It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water. And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that.
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon.
        -  i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water
        - The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts, 
        - And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking.
        - It doesn't.
        - but in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water.
        - Yeah, it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar.
        - Expresses a concern about student’s understanding of the question
        - It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples. That's what the question was asked.
        - Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking.
        - So, but ok but they don't actually say anything about water and and paragraph true they only talk about water in paragraph. I mean, I say they say like you can drink water. Um, but it doesn't say that like I didn't, I didn't see discover or water in that paragraph.
        - I hadn't hadn't heard of that just yet.
        - But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question. 
        - Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us
        -  just the orbiter, and the microscope.
        - Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear. We're looking at when they used to find the water. 
        - which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon.
        - But right now, we're looking for the The actual to the piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, I went to NASA with my dad. So I know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks, well Ehtan said that one, and like masks. They have to wear a mask because they can't breathe in space.
        - So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon.
        - We kind of need both. So although I really love your answer. And it did teach me something I do want you to answer the question.
        - but do you think that that's answering the question.
        - And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon.
        - They do. But that's not what the, um, that's not what. The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon. It was the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So we are looking for the one that was used to discover or to find. So can you think of, I can you see another equipment that was mentioned in the passage, apart from the microscope.
        - Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so.
        - But another really important part of his question is the action 
        -  but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines.
        - Yeah, the lunar orbiter
        - part of the question do you think you're missing.
        - Alright Luis, so, when we look back at the question. It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon. Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?
        - but is the question asking is it right now.
        - Yes, very good. So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together. But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically
        - You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future.
        - I was just gonna say that I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - However, what is, what is the question is asking
        -  So I want to ask all of you guys take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think: What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question. And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question. Okay. So I'm going to give you guys 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it. And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer. Okay.
        - But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so
        - The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically
        - So your        - Chris, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon. Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question. Do you understand?
        - I don't think you read the question correctly, either.
        - They questions more based on the videos that you watched or the YouTube videos you watch. It's about what you read. 
        - That's right. That's very good. It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking, 
        - but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water
        - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment. What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah, I think, I think that makes sense. Like, so I'm supposed to like pull from the reading answer the question.
        - But they said that you need the microscope to look at the water
        - Absolutely and that's something that like Luis put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us. 
        - I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon.
        - Now it's so they don't need the oxygen, if they're going up to space.
        - To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water.
        - However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly. The main question. This is the next step after they discovered water for the morn, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one
        - Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked.
        - Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found. 
        - Oh um yeah no, I guess, they don't use that to discover water.
        - So you guys are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated.
        - But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-        - is that a type of equipment?
        - In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that.
        - Like just for the water.
        - but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable. Not that they're ready. Would it be valuable to
        - But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text. So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for. Can you tell me that. Are you able to tell me what the question is.
- intent: r410.2
  examples: |
        - But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption. I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so.
        - And, as I talked, as I said, to Farrah she said microscope which is-was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah.
        - Jazmin, you said that NASA send a small machine which is completely correct. But I think what I was looking for is a little bit more information on
        - Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question.
        - yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question
        - . But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Well, I mean I went to NASA so I know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here.
        - And Luis That you put scientists found is using a small machine. so that small machine is correct. that small machine could be any sort of tool. But it's not the specific machine.
        - But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?.
        -  I think. I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific.
        - So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So, back to you. Svannah and Oliver. the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water. So my suggestion to all of you would be to maybe.
        - So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me. It's just a little bit incomplete.
        - yeah I did the same ones that Jazmin did I highlighted the Lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope.
        - I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer. Farrah. So the way that you worded your answer. It didn't really restate the question.
        - Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter. They're not going to what we're talking about. What if we put
        - So you Chris took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article.
        - Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer. What small machine? What was it called?
        - When we provide information from our own background knowledge. The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information.
        -  And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true. It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's. We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine.
        - but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right
        - I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators. so did you go and highlight two types of equipment?
        - So is it heavy. Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it. So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon. So their ships wouldn't have to carry it. Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - So I didn't I really want to hear. I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as Farrah. 
        - And Farrah had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth. I want to know what Oliver found in the reading. I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great.
        - But I want to hear more specific answers in that. What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like
        - Oh. No, it doesn't. So that actually makes sense. So I didn't really answer the question, I just was I did. I understand. Oh, that's exciting. I really understand
        - But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon.
        - Yeah yeah now. Okay.
        - The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts. I don't think the intention is for it to discover water.
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate. Um, a lunar orbiter?
        - Well as sentences NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that this specific machine is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oliver, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words, 
        - And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving Luis um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question. right like how Is that why water is valuable. why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why.
        - It seems like it would take a lot of money and time.
        -  Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon.
        - And that's a it's an equipment, isn't it, but we look in the passage for a specific small machine and it tells us in the passage that there is a it gives us the name of the small machine.
        - They don't really say that is where Mr. Luis talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts. It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks, do they do use them? Yes, but not in this text. 
        - whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could.
        - So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question.
        -  but it's still wrong. And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at. We want to know about this equipment. So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically
        - And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts.
        - Yeah, I think so. I think so.
        - They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable. 
        - AND then Chris. so your response says that they found craters full of water. But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters.
        - You just needed the name of the item that they used.
        - But the question here is based on the text that we just read.
        - So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space. But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that.
        - Well, just because you need to have a deeper understanding doesn't mean your answers wrong just that you could probably put in a little more detail in your answer.
        - So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail.
        - Perfect. Perfect. That's great. And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as Farrah, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer. 
        - Yeah. Yeah, you did.
        - What Luis and Chris described is how they got to the moon
        - Oh so it's just stuff that we read not stuff that we knew.
        - At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample.
        - Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for. In this case, Jazmin was a little too vague.
        - Yes, yes, they do. They absolutely do. But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story. 
        - Your answer is not wrong but it's not correct, you said yes, they use a small machine and the Lunar orbit is a machine, but it was not as specific as I would have wanted to hear.
        - Uh, your answer is technically correct. The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter.
        - Wow, I guess I didn't really read it that well closely. So maybe I didn't, I didn't, I didn't really read it.
        - Right. So how does your answer. Show me evidence of water being valuable.
        - We have to pick the equipment from the story.
        - lets people know what you're talking about. Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter. We're not going to which question. It goes to
        - But we wanted to use the text 
        - And that is very, very true, but it's not exactly phrased in the way that answers the question.
        - Oh, Lunar Orbiter.
        - Oh, interesting. So, well, I guess what I thought was that you couldn't discover the water, unless you saw the water
        -  but it's not quite the only thing that they used.
        - Teacher : Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon.
        - If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space.
        - As we're talking about equipment, I was thinking so I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Yes. So, like so. Okay, so the question was, like, how did scientists discover water on the moon and like so they use a microscope for like something for like to, like, study the water
        - That is a really good answer. So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one. One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question. So
        - Well, I mean they can't walk around on the moon without oxygen tanks to breathe.
        - Your answer is about the kind of water that they found they signed up for was that I thought was microscopic, it doesn't really say that how they got the water. Does that make a difference?
        - All right, well then, if you think you're good. Let's look at your response. First, let's see, our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. That is very true, but I'm concerned that you're not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon.
        -  So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water. So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water.
        - For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it. However, maybe Oliver doesn't know that. So if he was reading your response. You may question where you got that evidence. And if it's truly valid right
        - okay and in your answer. You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does. Does your answer tell what discovered the water?
        - I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope.
        - um I it's not wrong it's just you can add a little bit you can add more to it and have it be a more complete dot not that isn't like a complete thought, but like.
        - I just wanted to see where you found it. I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the class knows where to look.
        - And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters. So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is. Does that make sense.
        - But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us. So even though your answer is true. It's answering a different question. 
        -  Okay, Farrah you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery. You just picked the wrong one. Right.
        - The thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same ias Farrah, which shows me that you didn't that you're either looking at Farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea. And so that's why I need you to to write your own thoughts and think for yourself. Okay.
        - See. Oh, yeah.
        - If somehow you looked at Farrah the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space 
        - Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume.
        - Well, your side equipment.
        - Discover the water. 
        - The person who's reading your response. Don't know where you got that information right
        - oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you
        - So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster
        - All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking.
        - I'm excuse me teacher. I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you guys found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think.
        - Expresses a concern about student response
        - You could have said no.
        - So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks. But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text. 
        - but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story.
        - i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story.
        - well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so.
        - Well that's good that you know a lot about space. We're not talking about space, though. Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text. So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that.
        - Where my concern is, is sometimes you don't listen
        - Yeah, I guess no.
        - It doesn't have enough water, but it hasn't not enough of something else that we have to have do me a favor.
        - Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific. 
        - Um, yeah. So, um, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go, I just wanted to thank you for working with us today and I really wanted to thank you for hor having us listen to each other's answers closely because we don't always really
        - But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out.
        - That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and Jazmin were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship
        - That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right.
        - Yes, it should be a good answer there. But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out.
        - Jazmin your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence. There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer.
        - In your answer it's very vague, so it just says a small machine.
        - If they just said, okay, a small machine. I mean, I guess, I guess no.
        - Um, yeah. I have a question, like so. My dad took me to NASA. And we saw that like astronauts have to use like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like, um, do they, do they like, do they have to use that stuff, didn't they have to use that to discover the water?
        - In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon.
        - We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon. This is how you go about doing it. We're talking about someone that's already done. We're talking about NASA specifically right
        - Teacher : But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks. So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks. Our question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - But I was hoping that maybe we could work on adding a little bit more detail to your writing because someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is right.
        - Red.
        - So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete. It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent.
        - So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response. And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right
        - So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water
        - So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great. But when you tell me about the tool. You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely. What are we trying to do to the water, guys.
        - So you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying.
        - And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used. However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer. 
        - Yeah, I think so. I guess I was wondering, like, did they did they not use suits or like, I guess I was just wondering, like, should we say from what we know or you know what I mean.
        - i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today.
        - Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was.
        - Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.
        - And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, okay. Yeah, cause I know we're supposed to pull something out of the story, and they talk about the microscope and they talk about looking at water really closely on the moon. So, yeah.
        - You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific, 
        - Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the.
        - I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in class but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say.
        - But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know.
        - Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be. 
        - Like you have to say what it is, so that not just small machine, you have to say they
        - Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine. While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster. So we want. We want to see what they say.
        - However, when we're given a text, we do have to look at what it talks about in the text. I know that you answered, saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks
        - When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things. So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story. Does that make sense.
        - That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because.
        - Oh I don't remember. 
        - Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it.
        - You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to all of our answers to make them a little bit stronger.
        - So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph.
        -  but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely. It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every all your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help.
        - Now, Jazmin. When I heard your response. You were a little vague. You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine.
        - Okay, so that is true. That is something that we read in the story, but does it answer the questions about what they used
        - Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic. So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step. 
        - You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK.
        - Right. They sent us NASA send a small machine, but you need more detail. Yes, I did send a small machine. But what was the name of this small machine.
        - But the focus. Question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and we need to answer that question using the article.
        - Oh, okay. So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft. Oh, I learned that word at NASA to
        - One part you were missing, though, is
        - You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon. Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space. I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water.
        - Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon. That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used.
        - I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water.
        - Another the main equipment. Okay.
        - We unfortunately have to go to lunch. But thank you so much for working with us.
        - Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too. But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
        - Mr Chris, did you consider that those machines were not put inside of our text.
        - If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question. Does that make sense to you?
        - You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right.
        - But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was 
        - I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now. Could you go into space. And could you discover water with that specific tool.
        - So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that Farrah circle, the same one as you.
        - Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. That is correct. That is a tool that they use. But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool. This scientist used to discover water on the moon.
        - So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be
        - Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific.
        - So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say.
        - But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes. So let's look at the question again. I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. So your answer doesn't really relate to that question. Do you understand that.
        - Master breathe with and they use different equipment for different task, but we needed to know specifically what they used to discover the Water Rat.
        - The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but
        - I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess.
        - Well, I'm glad you know all about space, but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have. 
        - I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading. Right?
        - So we got to make sure that when we're answering. We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were.
        - but can I ask you another question about that. So is that convincing me that water would be valuable?
        - But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?
        - Yes, so NASA did send a small machine. So, good job. And that is really close to what we're looking for here. So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine.
        - So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity. If we were more, a little more specific, I should say. So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?
        - Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that. It's really cool. But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon.
        - So all those facts are right that you guys had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay.
        - and i'm concerned that the responses that you guys chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon 
        - When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text.
        - but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take
        - And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence 
        - But there weren't any astronauts present. So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed
        - i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts 
        - Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text. It didn't talk about that.
        - No, you're right. Luis So it does talk about oxygen. But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment. So we know that one doesn't answer a question.
        - i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your.
        - Absolutely. That is correct. If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen. But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water. 
        - Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on. Okay.
        - Oh, like, Oh, I see. So, okay, that's actually that's really helpful. So like I didn't say like what equipment. I just was talking about craters.
        - Yes, we have to go to lunch.
        - Because your answer could have gone either way.
        - Um, I think you just said the Lunar Orbiter.
        - But you focus on the article. Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that
        - Um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment, I forgot the equipment part.
        - Or they probably did. But for the sake of this question and the passage that we're looking at. We are going to actually identify the answer from the passage. Right.
        - but we want to find a piece of equipment that the scientists actually used here
        - but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that.
        - However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text.
        - I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer.
        - Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details.
        - Okay um well, I think it is the Lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for.
        - I think we just need some more to it.
        - yeah okay I knew what it was I knew that it was.
        - But what made you say that, my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer right.
        - However, there was another machine you guys that they also used 
        - So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time.
        - Okay, I guess I thought we were all here cuz our answers were wrong. I thought that's why the teacher told us to come to this small group.
        - Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading. 
        - So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards. 
        - Okay, so Luis your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence. You just stated evidence.
        - Thinking back on what I just told Luis, does it answer the question that we are asking
        - So your answer is right, but you will have-didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name. 
        - But yeah i'm so Farrah had a good answer it could have been longer but.
        - just like Luis he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree.
        - So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with Farrah, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it.
        - But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific.
        - It was more that we just need to build more on it.
        - Correct. So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water
        - Oh no, I would never do that. I know a lot of stuff. I like to watch stuff on YouTube and I like to read about space too. Um, I circled it, I circled that because I know that um that a microscope is is like a tool and this says, this says, if you look at the whole thing . It says that the moon is drier than the dryest desert on Earth. Why did they find ice microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you look straight at it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely.
        - Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of.
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly.
        - Wow, that's very possible and Chris, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy. That is true. But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable.
        - and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it .
        - Yeah, I think it does. Yes, thank you.
        -  because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component.
        - There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon.
        - But we need to highlight the equipment. 
        - Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term.
        - Yes. So, you missed one part of that because it works as a group. Okay, Mr. Chris?
        - Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small.
        - But I think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific, as in the microscope lunar orbiter getting a little bit more detail from the reading. So you're on. You're on the correct track Jazmin. We just need to push it a little bit more into detail. Go ahead. Jazmin.
        - So scientists do use those type of things. You're right. And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool. There are a piece of equipment that they used
        - So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to Farrah, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and
        - But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery
        - a machine so lunar orbiter.
        - So you identify why water is valuable. But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon.
        - but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see.
        - They did send a small machine to discover water on the moon. But what was the name. We're looking for more detail. What was the name of the small machine.
        - I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text. So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer.
        - What they were looking at. So what were they looking at closely.
        - Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Yeah, I didn't include equipment. I just said, like where they found the water
        - Right, so you have the answer. Small machine. My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine.
        - I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it. I think you need to add a little bit more
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question.
        - Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I don't understand why that answers wrong.
        - So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics. 
        - But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but.
        - Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using.
        - Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine, right. They did send a small machine. But what I'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine.
        - I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as Farrah.
        - Yes. And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right.
        - Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah Jazmin.
        - They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text.
        - But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding.
        - You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine.
        - I think I know I think I was just, I know what this machine was so is the answer. The Lunar Orbiter.
        - So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting guys to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water. Does that make sense.
        - Okay, I guess i'm not sure if I agree or not okay.
        - But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so Chris. I really appreciate that point and you are correct. That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this.
        - Yeah, that does so like I need to use the evidence not like background knowledge.
        - Yeah, cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that I did have I circled the last sentence which says arm YOU NEED A SCIENTIFIC POLL ON A microscope to look really closely.
        - And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question.
        - I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything. You just said I circled the same as savannas I it doesn't help me know if you understand the question, or the answer really um
        - yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though.
        - Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?
        - mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself 
        - Yes, a new answer. Luis So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail. And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for.
        - You could have been looking at her paper.
        - But you need a little more specific. Okay.
        - answers the question better. 
        - We look at the text that you have we want to see what equipment they talked about from the article so that may be true, on space exploration, that we do need.
        - Right, we would think that, but when we look at our key words from the text we got to remember, it's telling us the answers in the text. Right. So when we look at our key words and then our key words there in the passage. We know that it's got to be more than just that. And we got to look for the specific answer. 
- intent: r410.3
  examples: |
        - Well, like we just talked about with Jazmin. There's not a lot of water on the moon. So I'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore. do you think they may still need to take some water with them?
        - I just want to kind of add some detail to it. You're right. They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable. The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?
        - i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four.
        - But what we're looking for is more of what's in the text. So talking about the microscope or the lunar
        - I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested. Sometimes
        - Yeah, I guess so. If there's like if there's not very much because we said that, like there were only a few ounces right glasses.
        -  when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size.
        - That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters.
        - Oh well, I guess, like what I thought about the you know about the microscope. Is that like they couldn't. Okay, so in a text. They said that they couldn't see the are acceptable microscope, because it was so small, but, um, I thought, like how could they find it if they couldn't see it.
        - And with that, Chris. Let's look at Luis. Luis You mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but like we just talked about with Chris that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story. So I'm concerned why you're talking about things, not in our story.
        - Oh, so they didn't use a glass to measure it.
        - This did use a lot of equipment. like you said what you use your background knowledge, instead of the evidence from the text that you were supposed to eat like I wanted.
        - gotcha so what's the background knowledge like is incorrect.
        - um, I guess, but actually it's kind of music because, like.
        - person it's really great job. i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert.
        - They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon. So we did use that, Luis. You're totally right about that one. However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find.
        - and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case.
        - or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth.
        - Oh, so like the equipment has to be like in the story.
        -  Because we want to make sure that when you are working. Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently, you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of.
        - That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it. It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water. Okay?
        - And Luis, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks. So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage.
        - but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,
        - I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely. like did you did you have questions about it?
        - Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment. when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question ,we focus on what we see in the reading. Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it. 
        - um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object.
        - So did you have questions about the passage?
        - Oh Okay, I guess, because we just kind of picture that wrong in my brain.
        -  but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered. 
        - So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading.
        - but they didn't say, full of water. You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting
        - You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them. I think they're saying they wouldn't need it.
        - Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph. it doesn't say was filled. it just said that it was found in the craters.
        - You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. There's where Farrah found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it. We're back to number two. 
        - But in your answer. I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon. Does that make sense.
        - So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention.
        - Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?
        - So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,
        - Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right.
        - A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon.
        - but I just-did you-this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used. They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage. 
        - However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading
        - So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon.
        - I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water
        - Expresses concern about student comprehension of the text
        - So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know.
        - I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading.
        - On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope.
        - Farrah, you had a great response. And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water.
        - Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon
        - right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it.
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good. You, you talked about how they use equipment. But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text.
        - That's an important information and it's good to know what is a microscope, a microscope and but there is another equipment that they use in the beginning for this Discovery. 
        - One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about.
        - But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part. Does that make sense.
        - Well, like even just said they use the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Read. I mean, that's, that's great. I'm glad you went to NASA, but Chris, you think about the article that we just read what does it tell us that the scientists used to go to the moon?
        - I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like Farrah said is microscopic. 
        - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage.
        - It's very important that we go back in the text. 
        - Luis when we are asked to answer a question.
        - With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough. It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for. So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us.
        - I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading. 
        - You use those. But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water. I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question. What
        - Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading. But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions.
        - I'm oxygen tanks.
        - You know there's actually very little water really on the moon
        - Okay, so let's start with you. Luis So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon. So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks.
        - Yeah, I was using up like you know how we talked about in class, sometimes like background knowledge. So I was using background knowledge and I was thinking like
        - Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so.
        - What he said you could you could, but it's super heavy so it takes it takes up all this room like a rocket ship.
        - You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then.
        - Um, well, I think I understand that.
        - Like Luis talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text. Luis I remember in your response.
        - I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye.
        - But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it. 
        - However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text.
        - That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like Farrah, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic
        - yeah you you so maybe I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope.
        - Okay, I'm looking.
        - that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?
        - but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon. So, that is right, Chris
        - but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water. 
        - That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon. 
        - And based on your answer. Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay. 
        - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text.
        - Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon.
        - that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just.
        - Uh huh. Yeah. And they definitely do need to use a microscope. But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon.
        - Teacher : But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks, but it does say in part number two. If you'd like to follow along with me.
        - Yeah, they definitely need space suits to be in space, but I think they might have used a specific tool in the text to see if there is water on the moon.
        - And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind.
        - But I want to know. I want to know that you understood the reading that we did. Does that make sense to you.
        - I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned.
- intent: r420.1
  examples: |
        - To look at the water they discovered. so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question.
        - Oh, I got it okay um equipment.
        - Chris, you identified the main idea of this passage. Very good. Go back to the question and reread it. please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note Of what kind of answer It's looking for. 
        - Okay, great. Thank you for your response. I saw Jazmin and Oliver not nodding their head. So I think you guys understand what I'm saying. Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question. Okay.
        - So go ahead and circle the words that you're not sure you know the meaning off.
        - Okay, so what words, did we find in our text that helped us answer our question?
        - Can you tell me what they want you to understand? Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question.
        - Okay yeah I feel like i'm i'm still confused because did I do that in my answer?
        - So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence. who can give me the action word?
        - So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text.
        - Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question. So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question.
        - If we don't have a really solid understanding of what is being asked. so with That said, what is the question asking us to find in the article that we read?
        - But in another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the key words in our question so i'd like all five of you actually to.
        - Oh, okay. Gotcha.
        - Find would be the same. That's good. So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question. That is a synonym for investigate
        - Where Am I find these words and the passage alright? so you have two minutes, with your partners.
        - Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure. Miss Teacher what about this word. This is confusing to me. So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute. take some time and look back that question and circle that okay
        - yeah so Oliver and Farrah that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response. so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that.
        - I think that's a great point, though. Oliver is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question. we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us
        - Can everyone circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it?
        - Yes, I will describe it to you. so in with this particular question in order to make sure it's fully answered, you want to make sure you're one answering the specific question that's being asked.
        - um yeah okay so it's asking me to say what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So yeah, so like the equipment, not the not about, so what should be the answer right?
        - So we want to make sure to understand the whole question. So we understand what they're asking us
        - Yeah, like the question on the text.
        - Oh, and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it.
        - But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, Chris.
        - Okay. So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session. What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question?
        - But it's important to look at the language of the question and say, oh, is this the is this, am I looking for an oxygen tank. Is that going to help them find water?
        - That's all right. Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words. What do you think?
        - Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence. I want you to go back and think deeper about the question. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Look for those little clues in the text in the question.
        - cool. so going back to our question like Luis said, what are some key words or some context clues that will help us get to the answer? so what's the main part of the question? what are we looking for, and the question? does anyone know?
        - plug it back in. You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense. Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question. And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely. I think you'll be able to better
        - you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future.
        - so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need. 
        - There's two words that are very important in this question. Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important?
        - Okay action word and question. Here we go.
        - Yes. Good. And so just like I mentioned to Luis and Jazmin is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question.
        - Right. But if you go back and you reread the question again and you take out your highlighters and you go slowly. You're looking for the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - That makes the high. Yeah, it makes sense. I think about. We all felt like we did at this time, but you're like, Hey, go back again.
        - Okay, I think that it was evidence
        - Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that. If you look at what it should be. Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see
        - So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question. So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question.
        - what's the important word in the question.
        - Okay yeah it's the same thing, even said, you know it wants us to tell what the equipment is that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon.
        - What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is
        - So looking for keywords like that.
        - now before you share the answers with the class, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled. Can everyone do that?
        - So again, let's look back at our question and look for two key words that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage. Yes, yes. Farrah.
        - And identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text, you can use that word to think about to help you answer the prompt or the question, if you have an answer ready for me. Now you can raise your hand, but I will wait 15 seconds to let everybody think
        - Yeah. So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions. Is that I would read the questions first. Then I'd read the passage
        - Oh yeah. Okay, so I I underlined water.
        - And Luis again. I did you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject. So I want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment, the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question.
        - Yeah. OK, so now please look at the question again, you are going to find out to look keywords all the most important words in a question before you answer it. 
        - And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question.
        - There any words that we circled or underlined in our text.
        - Identify what kind of answer the question is asking for. Yeah.
        - So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question.
        - Because what you just described is how they got to the moon. 
        - What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence.
        - about what exactly the question is asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question.
        - But let's look back at the question that was proposed. So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer. Would anybody like to reread that for me.
        - But one thing I want you to focus on at that you as well, because you to have pretty similar answers I want you to focus on the key action word, so we have that word discover right.
        - Yes, thank you. Farrah for answering. That is very true. When answering the question we want to look at important words they manage, do you have something else to say.
        - Let me know what this question is actually asking what what.
        - Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable. So I said no. Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready.
        -  And I'm looking for one more piece of the sentence. One more piece of the question.
        - So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of Olivers and savannas answers. And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions.
        - Yeah, so I kind of know like all about space, like, I don't think I really need to be in this group because I already know. Like all this stuff.
        - All right guys I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question. Yes. Luis
        - Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story.
        - Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that Oliver used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that. 
        - So What words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question. 
        - Yes, once again, that's also very important. And that's good information. But when we answer questions we need to make sure we answer on what's being asked of us.
        - I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer. They won't be convinced.
        - Thank you for sharing Jazmin. So you said evidence. Evidence is important and what's another important piece of this sentence, and upon part of the sentence that we need in order to answer the question specifically
        - Oh, whoops you said two, I circled like four
        - By throwing in a little something that could be the answer. But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give. now Jazmin, what's your question?
        - That's right. So, but let's look at the question again. Once you reread that question. Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for
        - Does anybody have a key word that they want to look at?
        - A microscope is equipment. Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word.
        - You know, like we have to pay attention to another key word that is in the question.
        - So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled
        - So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes. Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you.
        - Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to
        - When you go back, I want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves, what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text. You two can start working on your second answer.
        - and you're right, it is small, and they do need a microscope but my concern is that your response, need the piece of equipment that made the initial discovery right, 
        - and i'd like you to circle, the key words in our question our action words, the most important words in our texts in our question here, and once you have a key word, you can raise your hand.
        - Yes. And why should we look at the most important parts, someone can raise their hand or Farrah.
        - Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question.
        - can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me, and maybe just two or three words, what is the question asking.
        - Is very important to know what is being asked. So when you know what's being asked of you, you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer. So going back to the question.
        - underline the last part the scientists us to discover water on the moon.
        - Right, so if the question so sort of what we you know when you when you analyze things you read, we can look at specifically what the question is asking and.
        - I would like for you guys to think about that question. And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking.
        - Oh, oh, oh.
        - cells to do that let's go ahead and look back at the first question, and what I want you to do this is like a really like he tip that would be super helpful and you could use later on to.
        - What's another key word That we could add to the list.
        - Oh yeah i'm still kind of confused.
        - Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it.
        - Okay, so what According to scientists use discover discover water on the moon so what's an important part of that question that we need to what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about.
        - Um, well, okay, so
        - So look back at the question and then I want you to read it and pick the most important word that will help us answer the question take 10 seconds and then we'll come back.
        - um maybe scientists.
        - If you will just look up at me when you're finished. When you've circled your two key words.
        - Yeah. Oh, hi. I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text. See if or reviewed your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question. Okay.
        - and looking for the keywords in your question as well. 
        - And your answer is closer to a correct answer. But what were, what was the keywords in number one. What were the key words.
        - So, right now, I want you to identify the object that we're looking for from the question by circling equipment 
        - I'm okay.
        - Okay equipment.
        - Provides suggestion (action step) to improve student understanding of the question (e.g., "Why don't we look at what thequestion is asking us")
        - Yes. Okay. So let's think about that question together real quick. And let's think about what key words. Do you hear when you are reading that question. So think about that on your own real quick and then we will discuss what keywords, we see
        - So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner.
        -  Take your take your pencil and circle. What you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for. So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - We need water to survive. All right, is there anything we have here, right. All right. Chris, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question. There are some words that you weren't sure about. Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one.
        - So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other.
        - So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it.
        - Should we, should we circle the words, this time.
        - What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence. So just for a second here. Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it.
        - Thank you. Luis for helping him out. So when reading the question, what are some. What are some strategies that we can practice before we even answer the question, what are some strategies that we can practice to make sure we are answering the question that's being asked. 
        - yeah so a really good way to think about that, when we're reading Our question is it says, did they used to discover water on the moon, and you can look.
        - In the question what which which which most important word. Did you pick out in the question.
        -  Okay.
        - Okay, great. Thank you. So does anybody have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for.
        - What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer. Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer.
        - Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about. First, I want you to look about that question. What's to that to you about that question, something about it.
        - And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question.
        - So right now, everybody to find action word and underline
        - At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question.
        - Okay, better better like about the question or just any keyword to the answer.
        - 10 seconds. And I want you to take your pencil and just circle. The two action words in the question.
        - Okay. One question I want to ask, is there anyone here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means. Is there anyone here because I want to make sure we understand the question.
        -  so you can follow that thread to the correct response.
        - And then they told you that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it closely. That is one way that you could find it. But is that the way that NASA found it on the moon?
        - um Luis um.
        - I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right. All right. I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that. I have a timer going right now.
        - So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question. Jazmin, you have a question?
        - But let's look at the question again let's see what is the key word and the question are using that's really important everybody look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two key words that you think the question that's important and the question.
        - circle some keywords for me.
        - Okay, yeah, I know people are still working. But I just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut.
        - Um, I just wanted to remind you, my dad and actually an astronaut.
        - I'm not, but I have something else to say.
        - And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion. It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do.
        - Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words.
        - Please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question.
        - when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer all parts of the question and that you're specific as possible.
        - Or verbs in this question. So I'll give you about
        - Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment.
        - and underline to discover water, the moon right.
        - So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important. I want to do that for one minute and then come back.
        - I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth. Okay.
        - everybody take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is
        - Oh did.
        - I want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is, and circle that okay?
        - But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you.
        - That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text. So if y'all looked at that question. The first question I answered a. Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question.
        -  so this leads us into a good activity where I want you all to reread the prompt and I want you to circle, the most important word in the process so just take a minute and go ahead and do that.
        - We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it. Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so
        - And I want you guys to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key.
        - Now the question. Let's look at the question again. The question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. Now what are some key words that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text.
        - But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how
        - is really instead of going straight to the text let's really know that we understand the question so before we turn that to the text  let's Can someone tell me exactly what the question is asking what is it asking us to find.
        - So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for 
        - but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering.
        - It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers. We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response. Does that make sense.
        - So if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points of circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer.
        - What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word.
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the keywords all the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question.
        - but I want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two key words that are important, that might help you answer the question.
        - But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one. You guys are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text. That way we can answer the question. So take just a second.
        - So i'm going to give you all about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question.
        - Yeah. Um, okay. So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water.
        - Of the strategy that we just did with Question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for.
        - But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question. 
        - yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment.
        - All right back to the question at hand, everyone I want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for.
        - Saying what specifically
        - And pay attention to these question. Okay, so what are the main words of this question. But remember, in order to have an answer. We have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for.
        - Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that.
        - My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used.
        - Nice cool cool good good so with that you know what we're looking for with the equipment can we break that down a little bit more what are some words or some key words that we can relate to equipment that will help us find.
        - As you're reading the test. So you get that information. You're the question is trying to answer so SCAM, IT LOOK AT THE QUESTION. And then read to answer the question.
        - And I want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important. I'll give you a minute to do that.
        - Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely.
        - Um, yeah, I understand, but I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space.
        - I said, and discover
        - So I think the most important thing is you already got the most important on the equipment we're going to underline the equipment.
        - But actually i'd like us all to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself Read over the question and maybe circle some key words or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that.
        - Now I want to go back and just look at the question one more time. And I wanted to read it and see if you're fully understand it words that you don't understand. I wanted to circle those words for me.
        - Yes, I can. I want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and I want you to find the most important word or the key word that you think is most important in this question.
        - What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question. The two main action words.
        - OK. OK, so what I want us to do is just a minute. I want you guys to look at question number one.
        - 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words. So let's. What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover
        - But before we start to answer this question, I would like to dissect it with you guys and figure out what are they asking us what is it that we need to look for an order to answer the question, you can
        - Did everybody take a second to pre read the question and circle the most important part. Okay.
        - Um, okay. It wasn't water. It was equipment and discover right
        - Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text. So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay.
        - Yeah, so I thought the main word was equipment. And so, my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and I don't understand why that answer is wrong.
        - Like a treasure hunt right So what if you could take a second and circle, the words in the question that you'd be looking for Farrah.
        - So what I want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three key words and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that okay let's start.
        - That's right. Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for.
        - I was just wondering why my answer was wrong.
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it. 
        - Yeah I did that.
        - tell me what this question is asking, or what this question is asking you to do.
        - and I can see one other word in that question that gives us a clue as to, or is going to help us figure out what we're looking. What other words, do you think it's going to help us to figure out exactly what the question is asking. Luis?
        - So actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment, but I wanted to thank you for working with us, and especially I wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves.
        - Okay, so different a different key word from the question.
        - Okay, well I'm very glad to hear. So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you.
        - So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to Jazmin.
        -  And i'm so sorry, and I just looked up a clock and we, we have to go to lunch, right now, but I want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy.
        - and I want you to look at those words again and share your ideas of what you think those words mean. Okay, so go ahead and do that for me. I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to do that.
        - What I suggest, what you guys do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water.
        - Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence. And I was thinking that, like, basically. Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. 
        - I would like for us to break down the question and figure out what are they act in us, because once we figure out what's what their accent us we can figure out How to answer the question in what's the answer the question with Oh is it convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. 
        - Great that is completely correct and I want you to focus on two pieces of that question I want you to focus on that first word which is equipment and the second one, which is discover.
        - I would like you some of the tools that help us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information and our reading is to look at the question in this and figure out what is it asking us. So I'd like you to take a minute.
- intent: r420.2 
  examples: |
        - what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task. What you said is good but it's a little.
        - So I can just add in call it a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon, and then this is a good answer is it right.
        - Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text. 
        - Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically. So you could say, NASA. Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those. I think would convey your meeting.
        - Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading. I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading. Good job 
        - Oh man, that's like a lot of words, you're saying we got to write all that down.
        - I but I think NASA. If we go back into the text. We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name. so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer.
        - everyone perfect take a moment, you can add that in.
        - A small machine. That's awesome. But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter. So would you want to add that to your answer?
        - You have to be more specific than that in the in the answer to the response 
        - At this point, we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and I love how, when you went back you're able to find The actual name of that small machine that they sent. so thank you Jazmin just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of them, the information that you found
        - And Oliver, I circled the same I Farrah. So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer. Just be independent. Alright, so talk about what you found. Not what Farrah found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water.
        - They can use it for rocket fuel. it can be split apart.
        - So you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question. does that sound good.
        - No, Evidence. We can add some evidence into our answer.
        - So maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it.
        - so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like.
        - but I want to, we talked a little bit about um adding in those details so remember when I was talking to Jazmin about
        - Chris and Luis, I'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use
        - So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific.
        - That's perfect, beautiful. I love that. Does that make more sense of how you have to make sure that you're answering the full question when they say equipment. You got to remember it their equipment equipment and then you can add in those details you have. those are awesome as well.
        - Yes, so she took the instrument. she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water
        - So NASA sent a lunar orbiter?
        - So I think yeah yeah. so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for Farrah would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can.
        - You're right. Exactly. So you had all of the right information. It's the one thing. Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words I say something like, to discover water on the moon.
        - Teacher : So I would have liked to see more information, more describing it. Okay. 
        - Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. Now let's go a little bit further with that answer. And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence. Does that make sense? Chris.
        - Yeah. Ms. Mahoney, I just saw the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch. This was really short, but I really appreciate how you really helped us think about how we found evidence from the story and our answer or how we needed to add more work and not just the evidence from the story, like me and Farrah.
        - Water great. Okay. so equipment discover and water. so keeping in mind those key words and using that evidence from the text, can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely?
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that Chris. now I would love for you to share with me. is there any way that you want to change your answer? anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling?
        - Oh, well, well, it's just that you know, um, me and Farrah both found the same thing right, Farrah?
        - Jazmin your answer. So NASA send a small machine. You're right. It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter. So your answer is almost there. You just need to add a little bit more information to it. Okay.
        - about the kind of equipment that scientists used. so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using.
        - And you were right with that. you weren't wrong, but if you could go into more detail about it. so in the reading it does explain what that machine was. so just to make sure that you give more detail, instead of just saying small machine.
        - They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more. they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need.
        - Well, I believe you're right but um to answer this question, we will have to find the evidence in the text so we're not really thinking about.
        - But i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage. what are their information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission.
        - I'm so sorry. This class is so fun. But we have to go to lunch now.
        - yeah so there's those are some details that you can use to describe things. So we know that NASA sent a small machine, but what kind of small machine was it?
        - To use evidence from the text in front of us.
        - However, when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us. We need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text.
        - Okay yeah I can do that that's easy.
        - yeah that's that's totally okay um so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that were being as clear as possible.
        - But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response, you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text. You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text.
        - A suggestion I would say, is, I know this because, in paragraph four, it states.
        - yeah great and so um I think of work to put all of these pieces together into a full answer.
        - t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that. And just make sure your bringing it from the text.
        - information from the texts or like direct quotes or like add the names of the machines, instead of generalizing it yeah Chris.
        - I was actually no, I think I forgot what I was gonna say
        - or is there a statement that you might think of or an answer to the question that you might have based with evidence from the reading?
        - so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention, in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there.
        - that's true that's true um What if you were to name that machine 
        - I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper. So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text. So, Oliver. What's up,
        - Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment. So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it.
        - So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question Jazmin.
        - So I want you to underline what you did answer, which was NASA sent a small machine so underlined small machine. Okay. And then I want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer. A little bit more.
        - but that detail you just added is critical. That's why it's valuable. The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel.
        - I highlighted the microscope to.
        - So I think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine. 
        - Looking into and finding it for the first time. That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now.
        - Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer. You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name. 
        - Some, some time in English class.
        - All. Oh, OK. OK, I think, I think I understand.
        - And give more details what top of small machine was it. 
        - You did, and quite a few details. Yeah. And yeah guys, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and
        - Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment.
        - Okay. Um, I have not heard that. But let's think about this text, though. Okay, so you and Farrah and Chris Chris. Did you have a question, your hand was up just a second ago.
        - So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we all agree that is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - But if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing.
        - So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned.
        - That would help. And go into a little bit more detail about it.
        - It's just we need more specifics
        - To answer them. If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it. So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks.
        - They found the craters by using the Lunar orbiter helped them find the craters on the moon you just needed to add that little extra bit at the end of it to make sure that you really got the answer.
        - Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen.
        - Okay, I guess.
        - The question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that was found 
        - So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose. Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah, you should you should make sure that you add as much detail as you can in your answer. So it's nice and specific, so I know exactly what you're talking about.
        - Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text. Why do you think they're using microscopes. Do you think it helped them to find the craters. Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process. Yes, Jazmin.
        - Yeah, it looks like you know me and Jazmin and Luis add some stuff from the text. I don't know where y'all were talking about Farrah and Oliver. 
        - That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask.
        - One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question. So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you guys were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading
        - Yeah, so if you were to restate your answer. Could you maybe say instead of me. Or you could you say scientists
        - So is the tool. I guess I'm wondering, like, is it like we're still or it sounds like the other one that just was still
        - wondering if you guys wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can use, we can find a more specific answer so.
        - While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering.
        - but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right
        - I, I went to NASA. So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits.
        - Then I'm kind of in the dark. Right. So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher. Right. You want to make sure I'm in for sure.
        - So my suggestion To make your answer stronger is to keep reading and then check.
        - I think you just said it, it's
        - So there you go. Luis So we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts. Thank you for sharing.
        - You need a specific scientific tool called Microsoft to look really closely. Right. So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context. So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about. Right.
        - The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter. It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it.
        - Right. So your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine, but I want to see more detail. I know that you could pull more detail from this. What was the small machine called. Do you remember
        - however, we can make our explanations even stronger by using more context from the problem.
        - OK. OK. OK.
        - I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because
        - Yes, pull out that one.
        - Exactly, exactly, the more detail you have, the better off your answer is
        -  way to add a little bit more to it, yes.
        - My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response.
        - You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth. Right.
        - What would be helpful.
        - Yeah, tell me something about it. And what else, what identifies that machine.
        - Yeah, your name. So probably the machines name as well.
        - Me see. Yeah. So you can use them for rocket fuel.
        - Okay, I have an idea. And it's that
        - but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day. And so maybe the substitute didn't have that. Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question.
        - Would say there is convinced. So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that
        - You guys had some really good responses for a couple of them. I wish they had a little bit more details like for Oliver and Jazmin. There was us a little bit more details, 
        - I gotta write all of that stuff.
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now.
        - In that makes sense that it was like I just tend to be more specific, like see what it what.
        - That's party cool.
        - You could say that to like you can bring an example of
        - Is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it.
        - The Lunar Orbiter or the microscope. So my answer is wrong?
        - explain what the small machine was.
        - um so would anybody maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?
        - Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific.
        - Yeah so. Okay, so what I saw when I was looking at it is that it says the water is the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see it. If you were looking straight at it you don't like you have to have the microscope to even see the water
        - It's a long answer, but what we can do for your answer.
        -  The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and Luis for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text. What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion. 
        - But it may be a smaller amount. So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer. I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there.
        - um alright so Luis water, you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen great job on that um So could you kind of tell me why.
        - That's right, to make a complete sentence, though, we usually we use the words already sorry we usually use the words from the question given to us right
        - Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that.
        - I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good.
        - Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe i'm being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response.
        - Yeah, so like what my opinion.
        - So you could be looking for something more specific. What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine. So when you're reading
        - Yes. So you guys just need to be a little more specific. What kind of machine to discover water?
        - But I wonder if we can go a little further, I want to see if we can build on your explanation, a little bit so a small machine, would you be able to know what that machine is called, would you happen to know that.
        - So we just need to add in just that hydrogen Can be used for rocket fuel and oxygen can help people breathe. We just need to add that little bit to your answer.
        - Now i'm sure you serve you did circle, the same as Farrah Farrah his answer was the microscope, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers, yes, you and samantha might have had the same answers.
        - out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two.
        - Yeah, you want to look back in the story and make sure you're answering the whole question that stories like your friend. You want to keep looking back, and it has all your answers.
        - Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is. 
        - But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read.
        - Okay i'll take a look.
        - OK. So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote. So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts, the writer's thoughts.
        - so I think you're on a good track, but if you look at the passage to you can um yeah find the word investigate.
        - So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools to, maybe, think further on our answers. 
        - scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states, so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is, is incorporated into your answer.
        - OK OK, I understand I got that well thanks so much teacher it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends. 
        - Mm hmm. And maybe what the machine was called
        - But for now we're just looking at the evidence in the text right that we can use to answer the question, but that is great knowledge to have so if I need evidence in the text right, I might use.
        - Jazmin. Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine. They called it a microscope. Did you find that in the text?
        - um excuse me, this is Farrah.
        - Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought. So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question.
        -  so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer 
        - When we answer questions, it's helpful to think about if we were answering a question and someone who has no idea on what we're talking about. We want to be so explicit and explaining or so detailed in explaining what we're talking about that they understand
        - and we want to add evidence from the text to show how we got our answer to support our answer.
        - I'm Jazmin, you wrote that NASA send a small machine. That's very good. So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called
        - So I think that would be a great idea Jazmin.
        - Excellent. So you can add that to your answer. And you can do that independently right now.
        - That's the only thing I would have done.
        - Miss Teacher, I just heard the bell, so it's time for us to go to lunch. I know this was really short and we just met, but I do really appreciate how you kept asking us to go look back at the text, over and over again.
        - would carry the water, it would be too heavy but then your response should have something about why it not the water not being carried would be a good thing, so just elaborating a little bit off of that of how
        - But we have to look at the tools that are inside of the text because every time we have a story that we're reading and questions about it, our answers are always going to be in that passage. Okay.
        - See if you can find it. 
        -  However, I want to challenge you to not do the blah blah blah parts and to see if we can actually name we're looking for 
        - You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage
        - Love it. So, Jazmin, if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name. That would be super helpful.
        - But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views sound good.
        - The sentence that include these three keywords.
        - Oh that's really interesting.
        - so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right now send.
        - And I'm going to talk to you one on one. But, well, I talked to one student. I wanted to show you something. I don't know if you can see it, but I'm going to read it to you anyway. This is called a sentence starter. Do you notice sentence starters, my friends.
        - So it's just a matter of combining your two answers.
        - Then Oliver What about you can you go ahead and maybe tell us what's your what might be added to your response.
        - So your answer is right. But I think that if we add a little bit more detail and we describe is there may be an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use
        - Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why. So you had part of the what you just needed. The second piece.
        - Second, paragraph does talk about a small machine that NASA used, but I want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific.
        - What that water is used for for the astronauts.
        - Something specifically from the text. So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter. So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks. Does that make sense.
        - And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response.
        - So I think you would have your sentence was great. Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable.
        - So I'm going to suggest that your group keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually.
        - Oh, your answer was not wrong. I think that we can add more details to your answer to your answer. So let's do a sentence spring. So instead of saying, NASA sent a small machine, you could use our vocabulary word Lunar Orbiter. Can you repeat that with me, NASA sent a lunar orbiter.
        - So now that you see where we got our answer. Let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete
        -  and wondering if we can get a little bit more specific 
        - Yeah yeah yeah
        - And I would say, I would add, try to be as specific as possible.
        - OK, so my answer was that water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships.
        - And waters on the moon. That's convincing evidence that it is valuable. So we just have to rework your answer.
        - but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response. So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it. Does that sound good.
        - Okay, well that that makes sense. Like so, like you say like more details. So like if I was gonna say equipment like I need to come up with like a few different pieces of it.Is that right?
        - Um, well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us to
        - And said what is valuable about breaking it down.
        - yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for us to go.
        - Right, so can we get more specific, to help us have a better knowledge base here, do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific.
        - I think you could also talk about your own experience, going to NASA.
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - That's it. So I just have to say like the full sentence.
        - yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and.
        - Then you would say in the text, what it says. Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. And then you would explain why that's important.
        - Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water. Does that make sense.
        - So that's another thing we want to consider when we're thinking of our answers, is does this answer the question that's being asked? Because sometimes our answers are very true and relate to the story but are not related to the original question. 
        - Alright, so, Luis, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer. 
        - Okay Okay, where it came from it came from NASA right.
        - Well, if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text, so you have this experience with NASA and learning about the equipment.
        - Well, it says that.
        - We need to restate that question in our answers. Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question.
        - Okay. So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions.
        - I want you to look back into the reading though we need to circle the evidence, where it talks about where you want to answer. You need to have specific evidence in the reading.
        - Yes. So what you'll do is. So for example, you are going to restate the question. So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - yeah, a really good answer would say both.
        - And so it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - So, Jazmin when you're looking at these answers. You need to be able to
        - So you could say, NASA, so like it said in the reading, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. Instead of just saying, NASA used a small machine, you could say, NASA used the lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - But I want you to learn a little bit from Chris Jazmin and Luis about giving reasons why you think your, your answer.
        - Well, I wouldn't say it's wrong. I would just say that it's something that we can improve on. There's always extra information, we can find in different language that we could use To answer the question even better. 
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the machine. They use the equipment they use. 
        - We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers. So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer. And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer. Does anybody want to talk about their response first
        - Cool. Okay.
        - It still has the same, it is the same, it does almost the same thing that your answer had that you wrote down but it just gives that a little bit more power to prove and to show that you are able to go back and reference, the text, while also understanding what you read.
        - It's a small machine and we want to get super specific when we're answering these questions from a nonfiction text.
        - And we're very specific when we're writing
        - In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to
        - So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you.
        - So how would you restate that question.
        - Hi, I'm so
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could answer this question. In your own words.
        - That makes sense? to add yeah I think you think I just have to add the Lunar orbiter to my answer yep and make sure you use evidence from the text to support that 
        - And what that week, my answer. That's spectacular.
        - Yeah, just that was kind of from your prior knowledge. Yep. So now we know to look, you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions. Yes, Deb, you have a hand up.
        - So like when say like someone asked you to build a house right um and your ideas that you had before. Your idea is not really working. So you're kind of running out of ideas and sometimes thinking outside the box like instead of doing it like this normal approach like the typical way of doing it. 
        - But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate
        - Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer. So our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon.
        - Ohhh, okay. That makes sense. 
        - Yeah, yeah, I can add, I can add a little bit more
        - yeah using evidence from the text, you have to state whether or not it is a valuable resource.
        - Right, so that is what you would put into your answer, just to explain and relate back to the question that's being asked.
        - Any misconceptions
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use. But so far, so good.
        - so when we have a question that tells us to use the text
        - You don't have to write down all of them. Exactly. But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand. You know what I'm saying.
        - to watch a final water I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - yeah so maybe you could include that.
        - But we want to say give like an a yes or no question. If you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving
        - No problem
        - and see if there's a way that you can use it to help make your answer, more specific.
        - Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah. What is it that she picked that I agree with. So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her. Does that make sense.
        - But we need to be a little more detailed 
        - But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article. 
        - gotcha.
        - yeah absolutely, so I think if you put these two different pieces, together, we have a really complete answer.
        - Right, so just that one little extra step.
        - And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you
        -  Okay. I can do that. 
        - Think about restating the question in your answer. If you get stuck, and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help.
        - Yeah, like your personal views, along with what you found from the text.
        - And looking for a specific question. So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. You could you should name that machine.
        - I think that you could have, you could have maybe expanded on a little more on instead of saying like I scientists found craters for water on the moon, you could maybe as is answer, while also kind of expanding upon it by like adding like blah blah blah. I know it wasn't too long of a thing to read, so he couldn't really expand upon it as much.
        - You could yeah you could say that I would also make sure you say what's in the text, though, because the questions asking mainly what's in the text so just make sure you.
        - you all have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers, and I want you to make sure see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move.
        - So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific. So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear.
        - It's really important to make sure that all of our answers come straight from the text.
        - And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect.
        - All right, Oliver, your response was really great. I love that you kind of collaborated off of Farrah's idea, but what I want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say. I know you have so many great thoughts.
        - Is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so.
        - When they read our answer to the question, they should, they should be able to know what it is we're talking about. They should be able to learn something. So, yes.
        - You was on to the right path of getting to the answer that NASA sent a small machine they did. But can you tell me more about the machine. Can you be more specific, while using evidence from the text, something to support your answer. What type of machine was it
        - So I want you guys to look at the answer that you put for this question. I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot.
        - Reach Every Readers: I went to NASA. 
        - So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be.
        - Yes, we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer. 
        - But, but, I mean, I had the same answer. You just asked her how first so when it was my turn. It was just the same thing.
        - So instead of saying small machine, we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter, so we want to try to be a little bit more specific. Instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter.
        - So when we answer. We want to be very specific. So like in the text, what small machine. Are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine.
        - To discover the water. So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer.
        - Well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than, say you didn't listen to someone else.
        - but we just need to beef it up a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary.
        - Well, I know, I know that I'm supposed to look for the keywords and the text. And I guess that's why I'm confused because I feel like I did that.
        - I could tell from your answer and I think that that is really helping you In Olivereloping your response.
        - Um, yeah, okay. So basically what I said I was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that.
        - Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words. Thank you, them.
        - So those are all pieces of equipment. Absolutely. However, when we're answering a question to a text that we've read, we need to be just using evidence from the text. If we use background information.
        -  Okay well um so we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so I should probably put equipment in my answer.
        - Okay, so should I reread it
        - They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we all knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it.
        - awesome yeah I think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water 
        - Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific Jazmin because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine.
        - yeah so my suggestion to you in the future is just to remember those key words because those key words like the Lunar orbiter that's an important thing to know for our vocabulary in the future in this lesson.
        - So I just got to add at the water all my all my sentence.
        - I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer.
        - OK, OK, so I guess I don't know how to do that.
        - you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon.
        - How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon.
        - And then, for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon, to take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that.
        - yeah Let me try.
        - So why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread.
        - Yeah, so you and Jazmin. Y'all see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen. Okay so y'all talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second. Okay.
        - To write down all. I'm sorry. You think I have to write down all of those words.
        - We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence
        - Exact put it in your own words or that you understand. That's perfect. Okay.
        - To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little.
        - You know I've heard that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - but just to make sure that we're all on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text, but maybe in the future when we're going further, you can use all your NASA experience that'd be great.
        -  yeah okay um so originally I was thinking.
        - Oh yeah. Well, I mean, I only said that because Farrah one but for me and like if I had gone. First I want to set it, but she went first. So if I had been first I would have said that the tool is a microscope.
        - yeah yeah yeah okay okay.
        - Look really closely at things, which is true. But I asked him into then go on and say, how did the microscope.
        - Microscope and stuff like that. But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer.
        - So do you guys see anything that could support your answers from the text.
        - I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text.
        - And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer yes Oliver
        - Yep. And let's be more specific, so if you look in that paragraph itself tells you exactly what it does. When does it do what is it, what does that tool used for? It's to find water on the moon, but how?
        - Um, well, I picked an equipment and it's about water.
        - It was called the Lunar Orbiter. That was something that was in our text water on the moon. And so adding small details like that can really strengthen our response.
        - You added more words and you added specific details.
        - Yeah, I bet the creators but but
        - So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger.
        - We want to be using that
        - And so your answer. You said NASA send a small machine. So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine. So looking in the text. Where could we are, what could we add
        - So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your
        - Um, it discovered the water.
        - I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me
        - Why you got there that you think, yes, it could be valuable and then some other supporting evidence for how.
        - In the text we can go deeper into the text and find more answers, like the machines and tools and equipments to find that in your answer and get more evidence and details into that response, and that would be great.
        - Oh, so I have to add that, to my to my answer.
        -  can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is I want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment.
        - And it answers the question better. Okay.
        - Yeah, they, they said. In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. 
        - Yep. So that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was lunar orbiter which is a small machine. So, you are correct. But we just want to make sure we're super specific about it. 
        - Oh that makes a lot of sense Okay let me change my answer.
        - But I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - I kind of wanted to talk to you about your answer. And you agree with Farrah, which is awesome but you kind of want to put it into your own words. 
        - Mmm hmm. Well, I guess. Okay, so if Farrah was like kind of something like Talking about the scientific tool and like more complete is like something.
        - But I do like how you did.
        - Oh, so it's like whatever's in the reading, ok. That makes sense.
        - So you got to pull those things together.
        - OK, OK, yeah. My English teacher says that to say it in your own words. I could do that.
        - But I always think it's really nice when you include some background knowledge like Luis did so, if you did, that great if you didn't it's no big deal.
        - So how about let's restating the question to form our answer. The scientists used a tool called the moon.
        - Yeah, that's okay. Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on. So you see how she said microscope. They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water. 
        - That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more.
        - But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope.
        - Like Orbiter, things like that. So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading. Does that make sense?
        - I have to add more vocabulary.
        - So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle. Something else that links with that to help further your answer. Can you do that for me.
        - Can you look for that for me.
        - So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific. 
        - Go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct. okay?
        - Um, so
        - Okay. 
        - You have to add more words.
        - yeah okay great and then go ahead and change your answer, if you think you need to okay and i'm going to move on to talk to um.
        - What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine.
        - And the text. The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines. And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer.
        - Equipment, discover, water, my answer does not have equipment.
        - You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right. 
        - Oliver. That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading
        - OK, I will. Let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete. 
        - Right. So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics. You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read
        - I would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things, but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine, but the scientists were using.
        - Look at the what they're asking for. So you got that you got you got the equipment.
        - Jazmin, your answer is not wrong. We just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know.
        - NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them.
        - Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing.
        - And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?
        - Yeah, so that's how you would want to broaden your, your, your response. You could say, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Yeah. That's perfect. So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general. So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on.
        - You want to make sure that        - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text.
        - Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can.
        - That is correct. But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter. So Jazmin, you were on the right track.
        - Is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen oxygen can be used for?
        - I definitely agree with you that the scientists are using oxygen tanks, but I really want us to answer this question with something that we found in the text.
        - So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer.
        - It's called a Lunar Orbiter.
        - So even though, you do have your background knowledge. We activated that. And that you know that they use a lot of different tools. Maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used. Like the Lunar Orbiter that Jazmin was talking about or even the microscope that Farrah was talking about.
        - Um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response. But it was a great start, good job Jazmin.
        - Luis i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed
        - So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with Jazmin. Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this. Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text.
        - pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon.
        - So I should make sure that I'm like I'm using something from from the reading, rather than-
        - Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine. What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you.
        - And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that.
        - So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you and this suggestion is for everybody, not just Jazmin.
        - I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - No. So we have to name it.
        - awesome you should put that in your answer to, then you know a lot about space okay wow.
        - um okay um So what should I do next.
        - I think it was the one that says.
        - So we need to build your sentence, because we only have a little bit so, how would you start your sentence.
        - So this small machine was called the lunar orbiter
        - so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in.
        - keep everyone should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so.
        - So Referring to the water on the moon text. Can you kind of elaborate on that response. Can you tell me why you need a microscope.
        - So you don't want to have an opinion. Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true. Yes, Chris.
        - So to fix your answer just a little bit. You are correct, NASA sent a small machine. And just a simple fix. We can put on it is at the words, called a microscope, at the end of it. 
        - We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know.
        - Teacher : Right, so I would like to see you some context from the story to be able to answer that question. Does that make sense.
        - Okay I can do that.
        - The only thing I would say to add is maybe you could, because you said a lot of equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks. So the maybe expand on your point, which was a good point. You could say, like, they also use like special helmets and like a special like space suit or something like helmet.
        - Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as Farrah, but if you could find that in the text and circle it. So I know where your answer came from. That would be awesome.
        - Okay. That's true, yeah, maybe it is, but I think there's something to think about is that when we're doing these assignments, we want to make sure that we're using the reading to backup our thoughts and to use evidence from the reading.
        - Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question. And when you answer your question. You got to make sure you add all of your details, does that help?
        - Lunar orbiter right so if you to add it in the NASA sent a small machine called the lunar Lunar Orbiter and you think that could have clarified your answer?
        - hi Jazmin with your response, I did say that you include a piece of equipment, but I think it could be more specific right, I think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about.
        - I know you spacesuits and I know they use gravity boots.
        - i'm sorry I was looking at the clock and it's time for the next group so we'll see you next time okay.
        - But i'm wondering if so let's go back to that question again what equipment, so we want to make sure I answer has equipment discover water great.
        - Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment. It could be a machine. It can be, words like machine or a tool. Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? Luis?
        - Yeah, I'll have to. I'll have to put some equipment in my answer to make sure it answers the question.
        - So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language Jazmin would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah
        - We perhaps would be focusing a lot more on the text that has been given to us in order to come up with a specific response to that question
        - Yeah, exactly. Sometimes sentence starters help us deepen our thinking. So can I read the sentence starter to you, is that okay
        - Okay, I just have to put the name of it on there. Oh, I crossed it out. I guess they didn't need to cross it out. Oh, okay.
        - So maybe like adding like a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence 
        - And talk about yourself, not another student
        - A way that I could see you making a response, even better, is kind of adding the question into the response. So you could say one way that the that water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen says, what do you think, do you think that sounds better.
        -  So that second Part that you just gave me. That's why it's valuable. So that's a great answer.
        - I just think that it sounds like you understand. So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about
        - Yeah. What does that mean, exactly.
        - So it has to be a piece of equipment from the story.
        - So I would look definitely more closely, like, I told savannas and you guys circle, the same thing and find some more other tools or more evidence from the text that we can use and support your answer in the question.
        - Perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them okay.
        - Right, do you think you could add that to your answer.
        - I love that idea. I think that's a great idea to help us expand upon our answer to add some details from the text to show that we truly understand what we're reading
        - It's really small. So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage
        - yeah like you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those word to equipment that they used to discover water on the moon.
        - I can't tell        - what would a better answer sound like?
        - talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to
        - Was the microphone scope to look really closely at the water because that was what the question was asked, so three jobs.
        - So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable.
        - Yeah. Right. Right.
        - So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text.
        - So I see where you agreed with Farrah. My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something 
        - Okay sure um so I say, the answer is okay well I circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment, you need as a microscope to look closely at the water.
        - OK. But Mr. Lawrence, I had something completely different, cause I took my answer from paragraph one. So I mean, I don't know what's wrong. I don't know why I'm in this group either. You know?
        - A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way. That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are
        - Oliver. You realize that Farrah had a good answer. And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer. 
        - Exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing.
        - Exactly. We want to say both, right? We always want to use our own words and also include some of the author's words or thoughts. That way we can back up our answer with evidence from the story.
        - so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers.
        - Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion. It's just what you think. But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read
        - i'm okay Okay, so it says that they need to come up with a plan and making the plan that's going to take a lot of time and money, and they have to build new equipment so it's that's not ready at all because that'll take a long time.
        - Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope.
        - The only thing I would like is just the restate the question. 
        - I was saying that everyone else, I want you to dig a little bit deeper right right now we're in space we're looking for our water, so how can you be more specific in your answer when you say NASA sent a small machine how.
        - We want to have enough words to describe what we're thinking 
        -  It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer
        - um because, again, as I said, adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and.
        - We can build on this sentence by saying, NASA sense and the machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in the craters.
        - yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah.
        - Yeah, yeah.
        - Maybe think about The equipment's looking for water, but maybe. Where's the water or maybe something to that effect, we can really make a more detailed answer.
        -  that's an awesome answer Jazmin, I think, maybe to make it a little bit more detailed, you can include the name of the small machine.
        - Good. So what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question.
        - At the water. Okay, great. So when next time when you're doing this, maybe explain what the microscope was used for. So in your next response, you could say a scientific tool use
        - I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable.
        - I think so. I think for us to build on your answer. So you have a good start. I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer. We'd have a complete full answer to that question.
        - and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers. 
        - Okay, great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right,so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle Jazmin and I think that would be a much clearer response.
        - I i was i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment. 
        - Okay, well thanks teacher, um, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us.
        - yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story.
        - I guess it was what Farrah just read right, the Lunar orbiter.
        - yeah can you take a moment to add that into your response.
        -  Oh okay yeah I understand.
        - But we want to figure out, we want to be as specific as possible, for example, when you go into your math class right and you say we use a lot of tools for math Okay, but you when you're trying to calculate you don't pull out your ruler right.
        - So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well. 
        - (whispering to herself) You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close.
        - If you know it's correct if if you're like unsure about it, I wouldn't but um.
        - How come. How come I have to add all of that and Chris Chris and Jazmin didn't have to add all that to their answers.
        - You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text.
        - um I think it's in there um NASA sent a machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Um, you're saying I have to take a big long sentence. And then I have to write it, but not copy down the exact same word.
        - What types of equipment use on the reading not not necessarily you and Farrah I want to know exactly what depth saw in the reading so again, the example sentence might help you.
        - Yes, so just to make sure that you do go into more detail about what it is and that's really the only thing, so if you say that it's a small machine.
        - Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called. Do you remember
        - I definitely well i i know it's called a lunar orbiter cuz I'm Chris just set it and Jazmin said it too. And you said it.
        - I would say, maybe let's elaborate a little bit and let's get some other perspectives, so does anyone else.
        - Right. But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?
        - No one is here because they answer is wrong. But when we answer questions about an informational texts, we need to be very specific. We should be so specific that someone who has not read this text.
        - Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more
        - I think so. Cuz she explained more of it. That's what made her that that's what made it a better answer.
        - Um, yes. So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff.
        - Well i'm i'm i'm really sorry about this, I just looked at the clock.
        - Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer. Okay.
        - Found the evidence from number six. That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain. 
        - You can do that too, you can kind of mix it in.
        - Oh well in the part I just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits.
        - on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on.
        - is needed for astronauts to breathe, and so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends, reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us, yes Chris.
        - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see that.
        - But yes, it's looking for something specific. So that's when you would want to refer back to the text. So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - Okay. Okay, so, so I'm not wrong. My answer is not wrong.
        - Um, yeah. So what I saw was, I was looking at what look like they said like scientific tool. hey said, small machine. And I said those were equipment words.
        - Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.
        - I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer.
        - Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully. So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon. So what you want to say in your
        - Yeah, so we have to go to our next class. But before we go to class. I really wanted to
        - Nope, your answer is correct, but to answer the actual question that we brought into it, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. We just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question.
        - I was wondering, um, can you describe the machine at all. What, what does the machine. Like, is there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine.
        - Yeah, sometimes that works. But sometimes we have to look around too. So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay.
        - Oh, I remember, I remember from the story.
        - but maybe we could elaborate and and why, why do they use this tool. What does this tool, help them with. 
        - Let me see you again, sorry. There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable. So there you restated the question you answered the question.
        - However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to Jazmin where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water.
        - Exactly. Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article. So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation. So we have to describe that. Oliver.
        - Pretty key to all this um.
        - yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called.
        - i'm i'm so sorry I just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for encouraging us to build on our answers but also build on each other's answers on and make them way better that was so helpful Thank you so much.
        - Awesome. So all you have to do is add that to your answer to make it super specific and to somebody who didn't read this article.
        - Microscopic so that's why Farrah said that, and which is why spins and ended up being really great because she explained how the instrument was used to find the water. So does that make sense. Chris.
        - i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific, so what were they sending the small machines for.
        - I want you to try to, when you're answering questions about text, I want you to try to look for specific things. And even if you share the same ideas as your classmate, try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking.
        - On the machine oh that's Okay, next time, can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all oh.
        - Okay, I got it now. 
        - Oh yeah I can do that so basically what we said was We thought that you would need a scientific tool, called the microscope We thought that was the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water we agreed that it was the microphone right Farrah yeah.
        - Yes. So, how will you revise your answer that include the equipment.
        - Exactly similar to Jazmin you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon.
        - I think a next time. If there's something we could Oliverelop that a little bit more like talking, you can say, you know what kind of small machine did they use
        - So we want our answers to be as specific as possible.
        - A reason why, like the thing that they found to be important in La um I know that's a lot, 
        - But you just need to add a little bit more to it, just so that way, we have an idea. 
        - Like ok, so like saying why water's important
        - um, so I think if we kind of bring all of these things together, we can get a more full answer.
        - Okay, I'll take a look
        - Yes, yes. And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just. If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now.
        - Yeah, I can see that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch.
        - However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right.
        - Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text. Does that sound good?
        - Yes. Okay. So, well, I start with Farrah. I want my friends, I want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer. Okay, just try your best. That's all that matters.
        - Oh well. Okay. Hello, like it says that the lunar orbiter will land up the South Pole and look for ice deposits. So maybe we could say the lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits. 
        - I guess I could just add the two names of the machines that on today in in in in Jazmin in Oliver said.
        - cool yeah I can do that.
        - you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does 
        - So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer. You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total. Chris.
        - But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it. Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way. I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box. You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box.
        - Know I just little confused because I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question.
        - And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank.
        - But i'm just i'm hoping that you know that the challenge of having maybe a longer sentence or breaking it maybe breaking it into two.
        - but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was
        - I'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and say why having more space on a spaceship is good.
        - Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer. And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text Farrah.
        - So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible. Does that help better explain it to you Oliver. 
        - So this sentence starter says the scientists used. And then there's a line blank. So this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon.
        - The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for. So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect. Yes, Chris. 
        - I think we can be a little more specific in your response. So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely. Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there. Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon.
        - yeah let's take a look at that um I think if you all have your text in front of you, it might be a great time to take a look at Jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment.
        - Um, okay. So if you wanted to know the small, um, I guess, to tell you something about it.
        - Yeah, and that's what Luis said. He said it could be useful because it can be broken down. Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more
        - Maybe, but you can also use the passage. Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable. 
        - Hi, friends. Thank you for sharing your responses on that reading. I just have a question for you to think about. When you are giving a response after reading a text, it's always a good idea to include evidence. Does anyone know what ways they can include evidence? Luis?
        - Well, I think your answers right there right, so you said NASA send a small machine I would include the rest of that sentence in your answer, so what was that small machine called.
        - Oh well, when I was looking at your answers and now as i'm talking to you all i'm noticing that when we're talking we're picking out some of the smaller details.
        - let's get a little bit deeper into that I think we can expand our answer a little bit um So yes.
        - Oh, well, it says that the machine is small.
        - That was it?
        - Very good, there you go, we just want to be a little more specific there and then we are good to go. 
        - Well, we said it already, it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - Okay. OK.
        - I was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first, excuse me, the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that we can That you can use as evidence for this answer,
        - But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need. 
        - It was right. But I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used
        - But I feel as though, like with a few of your other parents your answer can use a little bit more umpf, they could have he could have a little bit more to it.
        - Can you show us
        - yeah So how do you, do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon?
        - I would probably just expand your response, so you could.
        - I found it in paragraph two.
        - Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer 
        - So just with write down the question and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question.
        - Oh yeah, I could tell you
        - Just make sure that we're going deeper into the text, one more reading it, so we can find even more information, because that answer was pretty good, very good.
        - Well, I don't understand why my answers wrong because I did.
        - yeah so I wanted to say um I I went to NASA and so I know that scientists they actually use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So when you're saying, just make sure you specify just be like, Well, I do know from previous information that they have to use oxygen tanks, because there's a very limited amount of oxygen in space. So that's all you have to say.
        - And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it.
        - yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why why we would need to look for water on the moon.
        - Sure, the equipment has to be from the story.
        - but we do want to add to your answer.
        - Or different things like that. Just Oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already, then you already have. But there's nothing wrong with your answer.
        - Because that's important for readers to see because if the reader doesn't read the text and then they read their answer. They want to know that your answer is right and that you're telling the truth. Right.
        - We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon.
        - Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me.
        - yeah Luis I really appreciate that you have a strong interest in this film and I know from your answer that you're really an expert in this.
        - That it's not, that's not the right answer. But when a question is asked  we want to make sure we're answering that question and connection to the text and we want to use evidence from the text to support our answer.
        - Yeah. So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring. Correct.
        - They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that
        - Okay, so i'll just add that in and then maybe i'll make another sentence, but I think I can just.
        - Oh my goodness. Jazmin, you just answered my next question. My next question was going to be. What does the machine do, could you add a little bit more detail into your answer. 
        - No, I didn't find equipment. 
        - And that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon. So I when I tell you to go back and finish up your work, please use that evidence to support your answer. Farrah Have you learned anything from
        - You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do. Does that make sense.
        - Well, your answer wasn't wrong you actually had a really good answer, but we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer,
        - Ah, so what I think we could do to improve is maybe make your answer be a little more specific, so that way when I read it, I know exactly which piece of equipment, you're talking about. I don't have to leave things to be ambiguous. Does that make sense.
        - yeah it will be great if you look back to the second paragraph, so can you just look closely about this for up and I go back to you later.
        - I was wondering if you guys could be any more specific with that 
        - I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse um so so Jazmin your answer was awesome like.
        - yeah maybe include that.
        - And then Oliver, I really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope, I would have loved. If you give us another example, or maybe added on to Mars, Venus thought I definitely did like your answer and how you
        - Did I give like convincing evidence in my answer?
        - So i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon.
        - So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine.
        - But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you.
        - It says that the small machine. This machine is the lunar orbiter.
        - might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple, like NASA said the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. 
        - So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response. 
        - but I want you each to come up with your own individualized answers.
        - yeah, why is it in, because we know water is important here too, we need to just survive, why is it such a big deal that now water is found on the moon.
        - Wonderful. Okay. So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment. So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence. Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible.
        - So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer.
        - to discover the water on the moon, I think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about. 
        - Okay, my answer and then circle start
        - Could really just push through your answer. That makes sense.
        - Um, you mean like to the reading.
        - That's very true what you said. But as I said earlier, we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked. We don't want to talk about things. That's not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing. Yes. Chris.
        -  They needed it to investigate the craters.
        - I was, I was trying to think about the question because this, the first question what equipment that scientists use to find water on the moon and.
        - Very good. Alright Jazmin um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it, I want you to be a little more specific, so you told me that NASA sent a small machine which is absolutely true, can you tell me what that small machine was called?
        - response, so I want you that can you tell me, I know that in your answer you said you circle, the same as Farrah but can you put the answer to the question in your own words.
        - But then why, my, here, if I was right
        - So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it.
        - So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more. Right. Well, that'd be a good strategy.
        - So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two.
        - That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question. I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer.
        - Oh yeah that's all I gotta do is just add more sentences? yeah I can I can write down that second part of the sentence in there.
        - I just, I would like to build more upon your answer.
        - your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more.
        - So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable. 
        - let's see.
        - Okay i'm done.
        - and give me the actual word with the citing source, then you will get the answer okay okay.
        - Yes, Oliver, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as Farrah, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her
        - And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use.
        - yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote.
        - Not yeah more words but you want to make sure that you don't necessarily have it's not always more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference, the text in your reading.
        - Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question.
        - I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024.
        - I didn't say that your answer was wrong, I think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article, but I wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence.
        - Okay. Um, well.
        - So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place?
        - Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question. Okay.
        - To restate the question exactly So if you restate the question you say something like 
        - Well, I guess my question is that it still don't quite understand why my answer is wrong and I just was trying to figure it out.
        - Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but thanks so much for working with us. It was really want to work.
        - So, given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer, I want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking.
        - Okay, I have to write that, from the beginning, because I was just adding on to my old answer.
        - And I think we can kind of change how that sets up
        - But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see. Is that better?
        - Alright, so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to 
        - We just need to add on to it that because you can drink water.
        - That's really good. So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA.
        - Yes, a specific name maybe right so let's look back at the text.
        - You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here.
        - Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly.
        - Okay. Yeah, I think so.
        - Yeah, like we should fill in the blanks, just to make our sentence a little Meteor
        - Let me go ahead and take a look at your answer NASA send a small machine, so your answer is not wrong, I would just love it if you could explain it a little bit more and be a little bit more specific so.
        - Yeah mine too, I pulled mine right from the story too. 
        - Yes, please do.
        - Yeah, okay. So if we rewrote our answers. If we might do that in a minute. Go ahead and think about why you might agree with Farrah. 
        - Oh. Yeah. NASA sent a small machine called lunar orbiter. Lunar orbiter!
        - yeah yeah yeah okay.
        - Next time, just make sure if it has a name include the name
        - So for you, I would say, Read we read that part and see if you can add another like detail on to it.
        - week so it's the right answer the Lunar orbiter or it's the right answer microscope.
        - I found my answer in paragraph blank. And this is where you're going to put the number. There's a number at the side of the paragraphs and I want to know exactly where you found your answer. Okay, does that make sense.
        - So Luis You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks. How could you be more specific to the passage
        - um okay um can you do, you tell me in your own words, why it's not ready, using using what's in the passage, but in your own words okay.
        - Sure. So, that that is a correct answer a small machine I were just looking, I guess I'm just looking for more specific, so later in the sentence, they get a little bit more specific.
        - Okay, I have to add something about convincing evidence. You can't survive without water that is convincing evidence. Okay. Is that good.
        - Great. I'm glad I'm so glad. So if you could fill out this sentence starter for me. 
        - Understand, maybe next time. If you have the same idea someone, you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up
        - So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for for working with us and, like, in particular, I just really wanted to thank you for.
        - OK. I don't want you to think about it as right and wrong, but we can always make our answers better, right? So the more details we add can make them better. 
        - To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help.
        - Teacher, it that looks like our time for the next group took out, but I know I heard you're telling everybody that they have to add more details to their answer so
        - If it's Jazmin's I saw that one. The name of its Lunar Orbiter.
        - Great. So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading. So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers.
        - So my suggestion would be to find some reasons why, even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future.
        - Your thinking so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me I would start this sentence, but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence, I would say to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank.
        - Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start.
        - I want you to help each other. Understand the text. And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you guys to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water.
        - well i'm still kind of confused because I found this this one right in the story, so how come it's not evidence?
        - Oh, okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
        - It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track.
        - So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer. So we could say
        - Okay, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Thank you. So, Jazmin, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond. Okay.
        - I don't think your answers wrog Jazmin i'm just wondering if we can find a little bit more evidence for this small machine that you're saying that they send.
        - Yeah, I think you're saying like
        - That question by using the two words that you guys underlined as keywords. 
        - Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers. And so the more detail. We can answer. I mean, the more detail. We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be. Does that make sense.
        - I would have loved if you
        - Yeah, I was just more thinking like these are things that I know because I really love space and my dad is an astronaut. And so I was thinking like even like if it's not in the reading, then I think the readings leaving it out, you know?
        - Yeah, I should probably read it.
        - yeah that makes that makes sense yeah.
        - Keep the first part of your answer, but only make that your first part and then.
        - So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine. But what does it do? To answer the question in context.
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine that's perfect NASA did send a small machine, but I want you to add more I want you to build on that now, you went back and you highlighted the Lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one.
        - so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text.
        - Because we must always refer to the text.
        - Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon. Can you guys and then you're off. You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it.
        - I think it would be really hard to get it ready too. I think that's a really good point but let's think back to what I just said to Farrah do you have any thoughts of how you could make your answer a little bit stronger.
        - So like
        - hmm, how do you think we can work a lunar orbiter into our answers? It says that they used it to investigate.
        - Possibly. Do you guys understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers.
        - It's small machine called...
        - So like I didn't. Well, I guess like that it would be valuable because you could
        - Okay. Um, yeah. Okay, thanks. I just, I guess you're saying I'm not like I'm but i i used I added more stuff from
        - That you can add a little bit more that's kind of the whole point of all of you, being in this group today.
        - a suggestion I have for you.
        - A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say.
        - can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um.
        - Okay. Let me take a look.
        - my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue. Otherwise your answer is perfect.
        - So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail. But they, It was a small machine.
        - So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading. 
        - um so you're saying I just gotta find more details and then add them to my answer.
        - Okay, so yeah I didn't have equipment in mind, but I do know cuz I went to NASA that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits.
        - Okay, well, I know you can breathe oxygen and so maybe they could make like a breathing room or something.
        - Oh, oh so like that.
        - You need to have a little more details.
        - but i'm wondering if we can get a little bit more specific.
        - Um, what it looks like or what it size.
        - Yeah, you have to write more stuff.
        - Yes, that's really good. Um, so yeah, so we found our answer. However, we need to think about our phrasing of the question.
        - That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it. So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect.
        - Your answer is not wrong at all. It's actually really great. I loved your answer, Jazmin. But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?
        - So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of what was that 
        - What was the machine well.
        - I really liked your response, because that is so true you did a great job on that response i'd like you to get a little bit more specific with that.
        - yep and then, of course, because we're amazing students, you want to make sure that the last thing we do is we always explain our why, and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that.
        - You can always write that even scientists use a microscope.
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer. What was this small machine called and what was it there to do
        - I need I need a minute.
        - So that could be useful in your response.
        - Okay, that makes perfect sense so like to make a complete answer it has to include the name of the thing.
        - I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start. Good job. Farrah.
        - So take a second and write a new answer yes, Jazmin.
        - Yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use that there are other tools that they utilize as well, so I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible.
        - It says to investigate and to look for ice deposits
        - Okay. Okay. All right.
        - I know the equipment can I say it?
        - I think I know the answer. 
        - No? So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text. So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first. And if you have more information to add, that's great. You can add that later. But we really want to focus on what we're reading. 
        - I do. I do. And I do want to say I only said that I circled the same as Farrah so I wasn't going to say the exact same thing, but I didn't like, circle it because she circled it. I just happened to have the same answer as her.
        - Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends. Maybe if you working in partners of two. Does that make sense.
        - Right. So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers.
        - See how that answer grows. Yeah, this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where anybody reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about
        - Home. Okay. Okay.
        - Yeah, well it's it's time for us to go, but I wanted to say thank you for really helping us understand what it meant to discover the water and not just like find it or I mean look for it. Yeah, that was a really helpful explanation.
        - um you know what teacher, I I had read that there will be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - Um, well, the question asked, according to the text. So we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions. So we had to find evidence. So you might be right. From what you know from your dad going to NASA, we have to use the text in order to answer the question.
        - To expand
        - Not necessarily. For example, if Farrah has the answer, then you can say the same answer, but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it.
        - So, like, I told for Jazmin when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well okay.
        - I want you to expand your
        - So my suggestion would be to keep what you have, but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon.
        - To make your answer very clear. And to clarify.
        - I lost my train of thought,  just so that we can explain a little bit more on why you think it's not going to be able to be useful, just because they're smaller amounts of it. Okay.
        - You think that you would refer to the text.
        - Yeah. And then, as we're looking at Jazmin's answer to what do you think we could add to it.
        - But I'd like for you to explain why you chose that answer. And I think you did a great job of showing me that
        - So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it. Like Farrah, or a neighbor. Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend. I want to hear what you found. Jazmin, I see you have a question.
        - Provides suggestion for student response (e.g., "To improve your response, let's include a specific detail about...")
        - And I also love that you using your new knowledge of equipment and you're realizing you know where where you can get a little bit more specific with your answer and the equipment that they use.
        - Like we're reading now. So it's a real text with real facts. You want to be as specific as we can 
        - Um, you can do it on your own. Okay. And then after you after you do that today. And I want you to start working on the sentence starter. Okay. Do you need me to read that to you.
        - Perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me.
        - I love when students make the question. Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer.
        - um well I guess Okay, so I could try.
        - And they didn't use a lunar orbiter which was similar to Jazmin's so all of you, in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response, so we can all say like in this paragraph, I found in your answer.
- intent: r420.3
  examples: |
        - If you're not sure what should I do? you can do is go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name.
        - So I think we need to do a little bit more digging into the reading and maybe we can look and see if it shows says anywhere in our reading what equipment was used
        - Looking specifically for that context. that's a really great question Chris, thank you.
        - Okay, yeah. You want both of us to look at that again and I will look up part two for more tools.
        - Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine. reread, paragraph two of the passage. Okay.
        - Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text. 
        - Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called? is that cool?
        - But I want you to really make sure that you're looking to answer the specific question. so Luis if you can go back to the text, and I want you to really look very carefully.
        - In our question before we write our answers. Does that make sense, Oliver?
        - Okay guys, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water. So I want everybody to look in your text at paragraph two, 
        - Um, yeah, I just wanted to say, my dad's an astronaut.
        - so I would want all of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery.
        - Bye bye.
        - What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink. we get four or what I can be put back together. And he says,
        - Also right now Jazmin Chris reread paragraph four to find out why would it be better on the moon.
        - Um, how can I say? maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use. 
        - But, you know, something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles and these titles and subtitles can give you more information about about the main ideas of the text.
        - would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon?
        - awesome well Luis I have a job for you. I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions, okay Luis?
        - Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use. So I want you to go back and try and find that machine.
        - it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text. sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text. what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover?
        - Similar to Chris, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use, 
        - Chris, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water. Okay then.
        - In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer?
        - So I found the equipment, because Jazmin told me what it was, but I was thinking you know I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - So there's more than one piece of equipment. I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use.
        - And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line. It tells you what we need to be able to see this. What is that?
        - So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?
        - So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water
        - Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer. 
        - I want you to find in the text where it talks about the water being so small that you have to use that kind of told hey
        - But look in your text Jazmin. And look, just a few more words. What did they call this small machine?
        - I will. I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text. again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific.
        - But we want to also find out how they find the water and circle, something that would let you know that okay.
        - Okay. Um, well, Farrah, Oliver and Chris. Now that we've kind of talked about the paragraphs that our information is in, Jazmin found hers in four, Luis found his in five. Why don't the three of you go back together and Underline in the text important things that water can be used for the astronauts can use it for. Oliver?
        - Oh ok ok so cuz it's because it's not in the story. That's why it's not a whole answer.
        - Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource. 
        - Okay I'll do my best.
        - But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words. can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water?
        - And see if you can find more tools at the scientists use
        - So take a look at paragraph two, and see if you can find that tool 
        - It's the microscope. That was Farrah's answer.
        - So I had a different answer and answer as NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong.
        - So I want us to go back in the text and look for the word valuable because that's one of the words that's in our question. So I want you to go back and reread And look for the word valuable, it can be really helpful friends when we pick out a certain word in our question and we try to go back into our reading and find it in order to find the right answer. 
        - Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with 
        - So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment.
        - specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water. Okay.
        - Yes, absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text. Okay?
        - Now the next step. I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question. All right. Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question.
        - Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question. Once you try it.
        - awesome. Thank you, Luis. Use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words.
        - Is thinking specifically about how they discovered water on the moon
        - Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick. And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover. Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph.
        - And not discovery process, so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it, but finding it in the first place.
        - awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay Luis i'm ready for you.
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the reading and read closely the part where they talk about
        - A tool. Absolutely. That is perfect. So if you guys could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools. I love that synonym Oliver, you are spot on. What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
        - Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay Oliver do you have a question.
        - Well, cuz I was thinking
        - What I think is, so it's like what I said was, like, the small machine. And then when I was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine. It's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one, two, that you would have to use right like to get there.
        - My suggestion is similar to Oliver and Farrah you take a look at paragraph four, and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there.
        - Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text. 
        - Oh, that makes sense.
        - See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question.
        - So what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment discover as it relates to finding the water. So what words are we going to look back in the passage for? we're going to look for water
        - So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we all to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us
        - Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate. Can someone see what they brought
        - Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it. Okay. Would you like to maybe give it another go.
        - It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something. But let's look back
        - But in this particular text. We're learning about one specific thing. So maybe next time. If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay
        - So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question 
        - So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit. So why don't we try to combine those two answers.
        - For you Farrah, what I want you to do is try again look at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that
        - um suggesting that water could be valuable, so my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph, for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason, maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful, even if it isn't right now 
        - I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you guys a minute to do that.
        -  so maybe you guys can go with the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic.
        - I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter.
        - You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water. Something they used.
        - Great let's go back to our visualization.
        - what's what's missing from here what's the information that's missing here.
        - Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question.
        - yeah well actually it's a comment um so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - Okay, yeah, I can do that. Sounds good. Yeah.
        - I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you. Go ahead and look back 
        - so let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important clues that might tell us right away what the answer is.
        - Because most of the articles about equipment that they used how they found it, so I would reread and do a little ranking and sorting of the evidence that I find.
        - So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable. Can everybody look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be.
        - So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them.
        - But, and so when we have evidence. Alright, start thinking about detectives. Right. So we have to be detectives. So when we find evidence, what do we have to do with that evidence. There's an "I" word in the article, you find it?
        - So when you look at paragraph two and three you're going to try to see keywords that may make a microscope and lunar orbiter two different types of equipment. Does that make sense? so why don't you do that for one minute.
        - so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable. Can you do that.
        - I guess I didn't really like read it as closely as I could have
        - Okay, and when you find it go ahead and just circle circle what you think that's speaking to that Okay, and then.
        - That's okay, and always go back to your reading and reread the text to find the details right. Oliver, what would you like to add today.
        - I want everyone to do that for me.
        - So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example Farrah yeah.
        - Yes, let's. A lot. And so you can look carefully in the passage to see where is the equipment. I think in the middle the passage. You can take a carefully look
        - I want you guys to first think about equipment or like Oliver said tools that would be used. And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon. So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon. Those space.
        - I want us to look for examples explicitly stated examples in the text.
        - You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money.
        - And as you're reading the passage, you know, might be good to take a highlighter and highlight key words. So when you go back, you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers.
        - So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,
        - I want you all to take 35 seconds, and I want you to reread the reading, but I want you, while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading Okay, and try and make it stuff that you haven't already talked about near responses okay.
        -  Okay, so I want you right now to reread the first or the article. Reread article, and I want you to circle, any word that you might think is equipment. Is that clear?
        - Called the lunar orbit Jupiter.
        - Two minutes and read and just and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but I want a sentence for out of everybody for a revised answer.
        - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine. When we find,
        - i'd like for everyone to write down say two things.
        - When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question.
        - Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question.
        - Look for cluse within the text that have a ding ding ding And I give you a signal for a scientific tool.
        - Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?
        - But, when I'm looking for a question from a text, I have to use what was in that text. And just imagine that I don't know anything else about it at that point. So if I look in here, I don't see anything about oxygen tanks
        - So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you
        - So just go back and read the passage really quick.
        - Can you go back and look to see if you see a specific equipment that's mentioned
        - So then I would love for you to go back to one and two. 
        - can we look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was.
        - I would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery.
        - Great guess that's definitely true, but I would like you Luis to reread paragraph two, and try to circle words equipment words that maybe that specific piece of equipment itself was what was used to discover the water okay.
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back. I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful. And if you want to amaze me. I want you to underline two things and raise your hand. Once you're done.
        - yeah I think I think I know that that's what I need to do.
        -  But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it. So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that Jazmin aright, Farrah and Oliveron.
        - yep so the microscope and the Lunar orbiter were definitely use, but I want you to go through the text yourself, and I want you to make sure that you can find yourself where that came from and what the evidence is to support that in the text.
        - I want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it.
        - Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer.
        - Or we could say, look at the word investigating this case. Alright, so go back in the passage and look for me.
        - For that piece of equipment. Okay. Yeah. So it says on that NASA centers small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, maybe we can look at the text a little bit more, I think I saw a little bit of a clue it's a small machine and we can find that in the text can everyone look and see if they can find that sentence of the text, a small machine.
        - I see. So when you read your paragraph again I want you to think about what exactly this paragraph is talking about. So
        - Orbiter. So you can talk about your background knowledge. Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way. I know that you understand what we're talking about.
        - Okay, so that's what I want you to think about when you go back into the text. I'm going to give you guys two minutes to read the text.
        - Um, I would really like to. But actually, we have to go. All right, so, um, thank you so much for making us detectives that was really kind of made looking at the text and searching for answers, I'm seem really cool.
        - Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question.
        - Although might have some other knowledge. Let's look at specifically at the reading.
        - so go ahead and underline The specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now.
        - Yeah, the reading and the question.
        - So maybe you could go back in the text. Luis and look and see if you see anything about equipment.
        - Provides suggestion for student comprehension of the text (i.e., "Let's look at the text to get some clues about...")
        - I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it. Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that.
        - OK OK OK.
        - So, Luis, if you would. Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned. And if you don't, what is mentioned.
        - Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that. You can go back in the text. And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were An equipment used to discover the water, let's take a minute because that is the question.
        - I want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay.
        - So if you guys are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text.
        - could you guys look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph.
        - Can you find the sentence that Jazmin just talked about when it talks specifically about the Lunar Orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for all of you.
        - So I want you to look for that Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon.
        - I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text Luis.
        - Maybe there's something in there because I didn't, I didn't really read because I thought I already knew.
        - OK, OK, OK. OK. The lunar orbiter-        - the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits.
        - And a word that might have a similar meaning. And so I'm going to have you look back in paragraph two,
        - Okay, yeah. Oh, I'll take a look
        - To see the exact equipment they used.
        - Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that.
        - Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is.
        - drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence. Chris what's up.
        - Being an astronaut and you're, of course, they have to have oxygen tanks, so in this question or in this particular case, we want to try to use evidence from the text right so that's why I want to do I want you to take a second Luis.
        - Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later.
        - So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - You can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two,
        - Helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon. But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon. Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools. Oh, we've already get some ideas. Jazmin, what do you see what do you think?
        - Isn't my turn.
        - Luis i'm wondering if you to take another look because i'm hearing about some really interesting tools from your classmates.
        - Okay well microscope that's also equipment so um, why is it the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope.
        - gotcha okay yeah I can look close.
        - OK. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter--
        - Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text.
        - But I think I want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar Lunar Orbiter. Okay, so read a little bit more, and maybe take some time to underline some key words in your Texts. Well, yes, Chris.
        - so, can you look at the text Jazmin and see what the machine does.
        - Oh, well, can you tell me any other equipment that you may have seen in the text that you didn't read
        - Um, yeah, okay, I'll read it. Yeah.
        - So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text.
        - That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the.
        - So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see in the reading        - equipment listed.
        - All right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned.
        - and for your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph.
        - i'm so sorry to interrupt, but I just looked at the clock on and we actually we have to go to lunch now, but I wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and understand it and reminding us how to use the text to find the best answer. That was really helpful.
        - Okay um so.
        - And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading.
        - So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things. Let's see if you guys can reread and find what
        - you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts, and we are looking for equipment, specifically, and I would like, for everyone to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly.
        - Even had some experience, Chris had some experiences. Yes, that's good to use your experiences. Right. But you remember you're looking for the answer that's relating to the passage. Yes, Jazmin.
        - So for the three of you Farrah Jazmin and Luis when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind.
        - And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water.
        - I went to NASA, which I know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks suits.
        - Okay. Well, I appreciate your honesty. So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - No if you remember back in the article. There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text.  
        - I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024.
        - So what equipment. This help discover water on the moon. So go back to all the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,
        - Right, but if we really want to know how did they find it in the first place, there is another tool that we can look for in this in this New York Times passage there right and so actually for you and Jazmin.
        - So I want you to so as I just said to Farrah and to all of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful.
        - But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage.
        - Microscope. That was, that was my answer. It was the same one I savannas, but like, it's only cuz you asked her first, if you would have asked me first, then maybe Farrah would have said I have the same answer as Oliver. Right. Yeah. So it's the microscope.
        - To see what they see what they were looking for so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this the phrase that would help you make that connection between what the Lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph.
        - Just pause for a second, I don't want you to read it, I want you to look at it and then try to interpret that into a sentence like Luis did.
        - Alright, so might be an option to look at right, but maybe I want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water amen.
        - But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place.
        - So, like how they found even I mean like today yeah cuz I thought the.
        - or ask a question if you're confused and um because Farrah also
        - who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that Chris do you have a  question.
        - If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers.
        - Okay, I know you had told.
        - So, Chris I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable. It's important.
        - I want you to look at paragraph 2 again.
        - yeah yeah look in the text and find find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable 
        - Oh, Farrah, you're absolutely right. The word discover isn't here. But I want you to look. Actually, I'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for a discover
        - Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers.
        - Fine yeah yeah so to find think about that general idea and see if you could find to go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover the not necessarily discover.
        - And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading. And we're going to make some annotations on our work.
        - astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space, so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using.
        - but I, what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the text and look for specifically a piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon.
        - So maybe not literally looking very close at the reading, but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to
        - So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six. Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it.
        - So now i'm giving your highlighters you're going to go through those sex that section that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon anybody have any questions before we start that.
        - so let's take a look my suggestion, again, is that we take a look at this paragraph two, because there is there's another tool that was used in order to find the water, even before they could see it.
        - Now that you've been able to add to your answer. I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer.
        - Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses.
        - I read I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
        - That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource. So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability. 
        - Can you be a detective right now, and maybe find that tool for me.
        - and try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay.
        - Okay, Chris, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and
        - Perfect all right now I want you to do the same thing and go back and do the reading again and I want you to pull out another one okay.
        - so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two, to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay.
        - Was my answer right.
        - Yeah, next time that would be really great. You want to make sure that when you're reading a text, you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to it as possible.
        - And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment 
        - You had what they discovered, but can you help me. Look for examples of how they discovered it in the reading and you may use some examples that Jazmin or Farrah and Oliver had but let's let's figure it out together.
        - Yeah, I can. I can do that.
        -  Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon. Right.
        - So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us.
        - Okay, yeah, I guess they don't really talk about like oxygen tanks, they talk about Lunar Orbiter and microscopes.
        - And we are going to look back for the tool as a machine that was used. Okay, so I want you to go back in the groups that you were take a closer look at the passage and see if you can find out where machine was mentioned where water was mentioned and where the word discover was mentioned. 
        - Can you go back in the text and look for specific equipment that they use.
        - so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two, there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works.
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a minute to go back into the text.
        - Yes. So reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment. Okay. And it's okay for you to circle some words that might help. Yes, then
        - You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used.
        - so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery.
        - When you have the microscope there you're like okay Now I know exactly what i'm looking at right so, but we have to get to the moon. So what do you think I want you to dig a little bit deeper into the text, what do you think help them to get to the point where they could use the microscope.
        - Wow. Let's see only equipment in paragraph two is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - Okay i'll check it out.
        - So let's look at paragraph two, and see what other tool we need
        - Did you find so in the text. I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does. 
        - Why don't you Chris, like I just said, why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe take a highlighter and reread it, and see if you can come to that answer yourself, find the answer yourself.
        - Chris. Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used
        - Here and underlined, a sentence where.
        - What the text is saying, but it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds.
        - Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me.
        - that's what that would be a good start so again my same suggestion, think about the question think of it in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading 
        - Um, yeah. So I said, scientists found craters full of water on the moon.
        - Yeah, you're exactly right. So I think the key to answering this question after looking at it and determining
        - Okay, I see some hands going up. I'm going to give everybody a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see. So I see a lot of hands going up. Chris What equipment or tools did you find in the text?
        - Let's revisit our text and figure out what specifically what equipment or scientific tool. The scientists use in order to complete this mission.
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and read for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon.
        - And find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or I guess I can help you.
        -  So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys all circle one word.
        - Alright Farrah will Jazmin you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline 
        - So i'm going to go back and check in with Luis about what he's working on it, will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about.
        - Okay, read and look for a signal.
        - So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water
        - Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about
        - Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on. So I want us to go back into the text.
        - And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that. The first thing is to always find evidence in the text.
        - So the equipment from the story.
        -  and we're going to keep our eyes open.
        - And then bring it in some right so again same direction as Farrah looking at text and see if you can find out how they were able to get it down narrowed the space down small enough to use the microscope Jazmin. yes ma'am I see your hand.
        - Yeah, that's why sometimes we have to talk about our thoughts. Because at first I will read something and we'll think will think it's a big crater, because it is a big crater, but then we'll have to talk about our thoughts of it.
        -  and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon.
        - But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading all three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used.
        - All right, stop right there for me, Luis. Excellent job. Thank you. I want everyone to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph.
        - Okay so reread part three. Yeah, okay. Got it.
        - How much water they had too so Chris you can go back and then look at how much water their own says they have found I think they say that okay.
        - So that means we're going to underline things that we find. So today, what would I want you to underline is where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer.
        - Um, yeah, I'm really sorry, but it's time for us to go, actually, um, but I wanted to say I wish we'd all gotten to work with you and hear your, your individual on comments, cuz it sounded like you had a really good idea of how to help Farrah.
        - Alright, so I want you to think about that, while I go ahead and talk to my other friends and I want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage.
        - I want you to read through the passage and just and see if you can find another example of an equipment that was before the microscope that helped us know that we even should be using a microscope to look very small bits of water.
        - Alright, so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you guys each a highlighter and you are going to be read the section.
        - So we want to find what it says in the reading.
        - So, that's awesome. But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. Okay.
        - To find water that's absolutely right. So I want you guys to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words.
        - So what you can do my feedback for you is that you could just read every time you read a passage and the questions given to you, I want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me
        - So I suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again. Can you do that for me.
        - so go back to the text and see try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovering water on the moon.
        - The second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable.
        - and maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable.
        - Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water. Scientists found on the moon. 
        - And I love what you did with number two, but maybe you can do that with paragraph three, and maybe you can do it with paragraph one
        - Okay, how they found it they found evidence that water can be found craters are dark places NASA sent a small machine.
        - I'm going to have you look at this paragraph again.   And think about if there were any other tools that were used.
        - Okay Luis so in the text on do you um I so either i'm going to have you can you please read over the text, and try to find what that machine is called and then i'm going to if you have it right now.
        - Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me.
        - So you keep you look down and you read about the
        - and maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water. Okay.
        - Alright guys so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion.
        - I also want you to be more of a detective and look to see if there's any other equipment that you see. Okay. Can you do that for me.
        - You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words. So like this question. So equipment. So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read. And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again. 
        -  and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can.
        -  And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question. So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student.
        - As far as what type of equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon. It has a specific name. So it's always very important to read everything in the text before answering the question. Okay.
        - To confuse the Lunar Orbiter. The right answer, because they don't talk about the learner or pioneer in the third paragraph.
        - So my suggestion for both of you delve, too, is that you reread paragraph two, and maybe some of three and to really understand what tool is being used to first find the water before they use the microscope
        - Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space. Okay?
        - Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different.
        - Do you remember that part of the article I wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding.
        - And while each of you had really good thought processes. I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important
        - Yep. You take your time you reread it, see if you want to add anything, because I think there might be other pieces of equipment too.
        - Right, okay, so I underlined it.
        - So what I like to do when i'm reading a scientific text is create a visual of what's going on, so I know that I have the moon, and have just told us that the moon has going to have a North Pole and a South pole.
        - Yeah, you're exactly right. Jazmin, so I want us to go back and reread the text, and I want you to look for the action where discover because I think that that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon.
        - Yeah. Read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time
        - So why don't you go back and reread the text to see if there's any way that having more space would be good.
        - Right and we haven't mentioned moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five, to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon
        - So we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the key words.
        - Oh, I maybe I kind of feel like I don't know I feel like the stuff.
        - Now you can use the words you circled "equipment" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there. Okay?
        - hold on one second even and I noticed that everybody has to work on one specific thing, and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it.
        - Alright, so, And I should have said this when you're reading but let's try to look for tools in this paragraph
        - yeah so like you're saying like I should have some reason, like like okay yeah like the water does this, they can do that, like, why is it is that right.
        - I want to see if we can identify  This this different equipment, because none of us wrote this for our answer.
        - yeah okay um I don't think i'm a should be in this group I already know all about space.
        - So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage. I'll give you about two minutes.
        - At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment.
        - I want you to maybe take a minute, while I go speak to some of our other friends and see if you can look over the passage and see what equipment was mentioned in the passage
        -  So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for. 
        - So I want us to go back and into our reading and find more example.
        - Okay, yeah, I remember where that was cuz
        - Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there. I think the article talks about being able to find water and
        - And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does anybody have any questions before we start.
        - So go back to the checks and look for that.
        - Chris You also spoke about paragraph five, so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find and why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship.
        - So I actually had kind of a question. I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA. And when we went. We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that. So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools?
        - yeah thanks teacher okay.
        -  so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two.
- intent: r430.1
  examples: |
        - I don't know yet.
        - My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment.
        -  yeah well I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - What was the equipment that they use to find the water? so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water.
        - So you didn't quite answer the question there. You did say a fair point. But the question really was. What type of equipment. What did they use to see the water. What type of machines. Did they use. So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use. Okay.
        - To what the scientists use.
        - so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water.
        - Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment. Please read the question again. do you have another key words like the action in the words in a sentence action word?
        - That's a good place to start. Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions. So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question. 
        - That is true. They are using the microscope to look at the water. However, I like how Jazmin really looked at the question. And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon.
        - The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time Chris what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements.
        - Oh yeah I guess I forgot about that part.
        - So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water. 
        - So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once?
- intent: r430.2
  examples: |
        - so Jazmin is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture.
        - You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own. You just said you circled the same thing as Farrah. So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in Farrah's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it.
        - But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote. So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly
        - So even though we might have prior knowledge, which is what you have, because she went to NASA. That's amazing. And that's awesome to bring to the table, but I want you to try to find the answer in the text. Okay.
        -  Well, the whole sentence says.
        - Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph. it's not that your answer is wrong. it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again?
        - I am wondering if we could get more specific Jazmin. right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right. like do you think they used a washing machine to find this?
        - Yes. Yes. Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question. So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon.
        - Um, well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying, NASA send a small machine, but, um, you could have talked about what that machine was and how it But, um, yeah. So you weren't you weren't wrong. Oh, it's just, I'm a little too broad. 
        - Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense.
        -  Okay um I guess I should read it yeah okay.
        - but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific. Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was? was the name of that small machine small machine.
        - Okay, so I guess what you're saying is that, me and Farrah were right too. So there you go. Chris, hmm. Um, but we just have to add more words. So all I have to say no it's not ready. Um,
        - That makes sense. Okay. I didn't really answer the question. So, lunar orbiter.
        - Okay, so I have to say more details.
        - i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question.
        - yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too. so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals.
        - We don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable. You want to use the text for our answers. 
        - It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it. You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific. I like that you
        - Well, I mean it's what Luis said that machine the lunar orbiter.
        - you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water. I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer. 
        - Make sure you back things up. it takes like Farrah Farrah, you know, like in your answer. You didn't really back it up.
        - It was a small machine, Jazmin. So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage.
        - Will I um I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - And Luis might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there. If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question. I think he would be on a great, great track.
        - Yes, oh, you did say that yeah. so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent. so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions.
        - And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you. So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer. What was the name of the small machine that was used? Okay.
        - So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine. I need to dig a little deeper. And what else does the passage. Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a
        - And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen. So instead, let's focus on your opinion. So is there. Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable.
        - We need to be a little more detail. We can't just say a microscope. We can't just say a small machine, you know, a microscope is a small machine. So we need to be a little more detailed and go back into the passage and highlight. You know what they used To discover water on the moon.
        -  So it has to be in the story.
        - Why would that be useful? That is an excellent point. But I want you to think about why that would be useful. So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence. So what is that next sentence say?
        - Well, your, your answer. Is it wrong. I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used. What was that small machine used for?
        - In this way, that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine. so it's still an equipment. you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so.
        - it's a wide range for an answer. so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific. so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further, just for a little bit more information okay.
        - Yeah, that sounds cool.
        - And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer. Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you. I still want you to say an answer, because I want everybody to be giving an answer. 
        -  so with  your answer, it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more. you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it.
        - yeah um it's called the moon, let me find it on lunar orbiter.
        -  However, if we were talking just about our reading passage. Those are not necessarily in there. So can you come up with a new way. To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you.
        - Yeah, absolutely.
        - so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words.
        - Oh hey, why would we change it to start with NASA
        - I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down. And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down.
        - was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra 
        - I'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. And why can you tell me if this is good or bad, and why
        - Oh so and all I had to do was just say the name of it?
        - Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment. So this is kind of for all of us here. I think that we could even
        - Well I gues it's what Jazmin said, maybe.
        - Oh, I thought it was a lot of water.
        - what I'm concerned about is we're not getting the whole picture there. Okay, so can we look where it says small machine and figure out what that small machine was called?
        - Well, they used a lunar orbiter. But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for. 
        - They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon. Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read. I want you to read that last paragraph for me, Chris
        - Reach Every Rader: Yeah, I can.
        - That's very good. That's very good. So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct. But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about.
        - So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question. : Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable.
        - The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine.
        - I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is.
        - Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and.
        - To the moon. So, that's correct. But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon. So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information.
        - Okay, so I should look for what the machine did
        - I don't remember the name of it um lunar orbiter okay it's a lunar orbiter.
        - Yeah, I think, I think it does. Like, I guess my question is, I went to NASA with my dad and I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that.
        - Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon.
        - You, you just said I circled the same as Farrah, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did. So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon.
        - So what i'm noticing in Farrah's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon 
        - To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used.
        - Okay, well, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate.
        - Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use.
        - In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question. You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water. Does that make sense.
        - Oh, like what you can do with them? yeah yeah Okay, I can do that.
        - And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay.
        - Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking
        - Ah, OK. I can do that.
        - So your answer. They did send a small machine, right, that is, but it was asking specifically. So a little more in depth. So could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment. What that piece of equipment's name was?
        - To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question.
        - So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick 
        - So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon. So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific
        - But we want to explore a little bit further. Maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer. And we want to go a little bit further, we want to dig a little bit deeper.
        -  Okay, it says it's called a lunar orbiter.
        - So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that. You can use this to do that. Why don't we change the subject. Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well
        - I need to say something specific because I I needed to be like a big, it's a small machine and like what it's called, or like what it does? Is that what I need to say?
        - but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?
        - so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover 
        - You guys are all close but you want to get an exact answer. So you want to say yes it's valuable because of all the things that you were saying. So you want to expand your answer a little bit
        - Okay, so next time. It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer. A Farrah, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote. So next time. Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's. OK?
        - and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used. So that's the only thing I would add to your answer.
        - What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine. We need to make that answer specific
        - Oh, okay. So, well, my answer was NASA sent a small machine.
        - They were just wanting a name for it. They know that you realized it was a small machine, but they were wanting to dig deeper and find out if you remembered the name of what that machine was.
        - Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water.
        - So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be.
        - Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there. So in the article. Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water.
        - In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so Chris. What was your answer to that question. Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself.
        - Luis was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use.  But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that.
        - Good. So with your answer. What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen. Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable. Does that make sense. Luis
        - Absolutely Chris um.
        - Oh it sounds pretty good to be like I'm extra rocket fuel that's probably really on like necessary when you're flying in space.
        - Oh, OK. OK. Well, yeah, I mean, I just found I read the whole thing. And then in the last sentence of the last paragraph. I saw where they said a scientific tool called a microscope so
        - um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks, you can maybe mentioned, like the soup thing where because that's also equipment, because they needed to be up there on.
        - Oh yeah, like using the evidence. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
        - And then you explain that evidence. So all you have right now is evidence
        -  but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail.
        - Your answer isn't wrong Jazmin. I want you to expand your answer. I want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine. Ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read, could they learn that information from your answer.
        - so Farrah and Oliver both circled microscope. that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely. Chris, you have a question.
        - but I would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text. Like for example, we know that NASA used the Rover to find water on the moon. Instead, your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading. So we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text.
        - Jazmin I loved your answer
        - Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water. So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close. We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water.
        - But my concern is, would you look carefully at the passage I think you have targeted the right place in the passage. You just need to be a little more specific.
        - So, Farrah and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track. But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer. Does that make sense.
        - Okay. You want me want me to read it again.
        - However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that
        - Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question. You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid
        - but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think.
        - Okay, so I just got to add the names like how Jazmin did
        -  um yeah I wish we Park, but we actually have to go now um, but I wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today.
        - It was the, in the same sentence as this machine it says, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate.
        - Okay, oh so like scientists.
        - But there's, it's more descriptive. They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine. So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. And you're right, it is a small machine. But what was the machine called and what did it do?
        - Tool a microscope to look really closely. That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific. You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon.
        - So I read there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so they probably are already spending a lot of money to build that and so.
        - Oh, OK. Well, so I just had to add the name to my answer, and then I'm good to go?
        - You did. You said I remember your response. You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA. But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific. We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text.
        - OK, I can do that.
        - It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer. I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence. Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer.
        - You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text.
        -  But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used. 
        - Totally and and that's very helpful. But I do want us to practice being that reading detective. Right. So I want you to find your answer in the text because I want us to practice that skill. Is that OK with you.
        - I can go look for the name.
        - Provides concern & suggestion for student response
- intent: r430.3
  examples: |
        - I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right. So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words?
        - But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question. So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks.
        - But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right? and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water.
        - Teacher, I don't understand why my answers wrong.
        - But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon. if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used.
        -  If you look at what the positives are, it might outweigh the time that it takes. so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon.  so Farrah can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon.
        - But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too. so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text.
        - Okay, so they did that is true. they did find water on the moon, but now. The same thing applies for yours. Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon? Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment.
        - But that's not what they used to discover it. Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon?
        - Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment. So instead of oxygen tanks. Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon? Does that make sense. Luis
        - Okay, so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph. So let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question. 
        - But I do not believe that was in the article itself. So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also
        - Um, yeah, I guess I probably be good, if I read it.
        - No, of course, of course. Yeah, I read it, I hope you wrote that I love the text on my answer is that the tool is a microscope.
        - Okay, um,
        - Provides concern & suggestion for student comprehension
        - Okay yeah I can do that.
        - Oh, so like equipment that's in the story.
        - How they would get to the water on the moon. I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water. So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon. why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water. Okay.
        - I like that you focused on the the craters in the moon, but I'm a little concerned that you think or you found that they're full of water. If you go back and look in section two or paragraph two of the text. Can you find a quantity of ice or water inside that paragraph?
        - So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that. we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior. 
        - But I am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text. I want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for that specific answer that you need. Do you want to try that?
        - Um, yeah. Is there somewhere that because I'm not sure where to look. Is there somewhere I should be looking
        - It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time. I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher.
- intent: r510.1
  examples: |
        - Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question. It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for. 
        - Absolutely. It was the Lunar Orbiter. So you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and I like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called a lunar orbiter. Well done.
        - so I think Jazmin you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two.
        - and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water. It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning.
        - It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say
        - Um, well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment. Right. And like look at what was using to discover the thing
        - yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists. We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers. 
        - Um, yeah. So, um, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we went to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us. Like sometimes
        - Um, so. Okay, so that's really interesting. So like the arm so like the key, the key word would be like what, what, like equipment like equipment. Is that a keyword?
        - You the strategy I talked about
        - Make sure when you're reading the passage. You take a holiday. you highlight important facts when you go to your question. you highlight important words in your question. So you can go back and you can try to find that in the passage
        - All right, um Chris, can you explain to me what evidence is.
        - are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question. Oliver, what do you think.
        - I am going to give you some sentence starters and
        - Yes, that is exactly what I would like. And that goes for everyone, not just Chris. So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading
        - Now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some key words that we have in our question. Okay.
        - There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before. What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using. So a lunar orbiter a microscope. Yes Farrah. 
        - Say, practice makes perfect. Right. So if you want to be good at something, you keep john over and over and over.
        - That equipment is discovering the water on the moon.
        - Um, well, I'm looking at it and um I think it says, like okay, NASA sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator. These ice deposits are very small.
        - and I think that that's an excellent strategy for anyone to think about when we're reading a text is to think.
        - Can You Do you remember. Can you restate what their strategy is
        - So that's great that's a great segue. So what I wanted to ask you guys, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically. So that's a great process.
        - You remember what I asked you to find
        - So for example, when I read. What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking.
        - Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence. 
        - Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so.
        - And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components 
        - Absolutely. that's great. that is a great definition of what evidence is right. when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question.
        - Yep. Sounds great.
        - Oh. Okay well that's easy I can just add that.
        - Oh, to restate the question.
        - Great. So Chris, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer.
        - They on they read the question and they found the action work discover
        - So Farrah, and then you when you change your answer to what Jazmin also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter.
        - So when we're answering comprehension questions like this. We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information
        - That can help you make some inferences. you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it.
        - Well, what I do agree. What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something
        - So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading. you're able to see where you found your answer. And you were able to find another part that you could add to it.
        - That's very good. I like how Jazmin was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and Luis that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond. Again, I like how she's very specific. She used the passage that we provided to find her answer. She didn't just use her background knowledge. she made sure to go back and find something in the text.
        - Mm hmm. Yeah. So we looked very closely at our text. we looked for those key words.
        - So to find evidence. We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that. Farrah quoted. And she said, paragraph three, so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading.
        - So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords. So you can be give the best answer.
        - If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay
        -  okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely 
        - So we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and like specifically like, you you really helped us clear up some misconceptions, we have like you helped us to understand the meaning of the word discover and you also helped us make sure that we were using evidence.
        - Yes, Chris?
        - Yes. Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct. So, so you built off your answer. So we went. I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific. We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for. And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was. And this is what it was doing
        - This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies. 
        - But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking. 
        - You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable.
        - So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were all really close. We just needed to look more closely at our text.
        - The first time you scan it right. You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah. More flow through this
        - So I really like to do is the race format. So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
        - Use your context.
        - And in our responses we want to use academic language.
        - Does that make sense. We know we all know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given. Luis?
        - When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text.
        - And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again. Right. So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question. Does that make sense.
        - Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer. Thank
        - Alright, so let's look back at our question. Who thinks that they they can explain to Luis What what keywords. Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question.
        - yeah well I didn't go to space, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits.
        - I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go.
        - Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two.
        - Yeah, yeah. Okay, well thanks for helping us. I do appreciate that you you had us keep going back to the question and back to that question back to the question and back to the text back to the text to find evidence
        - All right, you know what, that's perfectly fine. Sometimes we come across scenarios where we know a lot and we think we know too much, maybe you can take a moment and read back over that and I'll come back to you. Okay.
        - Yeah. So often when we read it will tell us a sequence. It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next. So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story.
        - So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question.
        - Right. So if we look at the passage, we need to start comprehend here. Here's what and this goes to all you guys right so I'm going to give you a really quick reading strategy to help you out. All right.
        - That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together. And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer.
        - yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions.
        - Highlights a thinking strategy that students used
        - Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch.
        - I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text.
        - All thanks Teacher. It looks like a time for us to go to lunch, but I do appreciate how you you asked me a lot of questions to help me think about
        - Did anyone else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers.
        - A, keyword, keyword
        - But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific, 
        - Really Alice. Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning. It was very specific. That was a perfect or smart. Good job.
        - So for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used, such as in our question. What did science, what tool. What scientific tool was used to discover water on the moon.
        - yeah Chris it's great all right i'm so glad that you have so much background.
        -  um well.
        - Sometimes we can read things, but not quite absorb everything. So it's always get a good idea to go back and reread your text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you.
        - yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with Luis I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response.
        - Great. So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well. You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why. So that was a really great response.
        - Yes, so we look really closely at those key words in our question. Okay. 
        -  great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer
        - I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique.
        - But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us. 
        - yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times.
        - When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on. So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name. Oliver?
        - So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank. And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment. Where are we using yes Farrah.
        - Um, yeah. So like, here's the thing. Um, we have to go to lunch, unfortunately. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to like thank you because when um
        - Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing.
        - So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so.
        - She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon. 
        - Okay, again, so. And much like with Jazmin earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question. And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components. 
        - But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text, 
        -  So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question. 
        - Jazmin, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking.
        - Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text. So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened. And then what happened. You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question.
        - What i'm going to suggest to all of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question.
        - Oh-
        - So to answer the question using and A race method you restate the question. Scientists used the scientific tool called what
        - When you're trying to answer this question is just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph and then find us as they're seeing the paragraph here just located.
        - So remember when we looked at our question. We found a key what
        - yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity.
        - So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important Chris, you have something to add.
        - Okay, I agree with some out because I do think that um well the thing that I'm so after Jazmin said a thing about drinking the water and then Chris, to think about the water being heavy
        -  so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading 
        - Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper.
        - See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer.
        - Yeah, I couldn't see how I missed that one. Um, yeah, okay.
        - Oh, thanks.
        - Keyword to help us and to answer the question. And what key word. Did we need to answer this question.
        - So it's important to read it right
        - What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question.
        - yeah I understand.
        - so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence.
        - so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use.
        - I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you. It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers to use
        - Oh, oh, you mean like reread it again.
        - Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water.
        - Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers. 
        - Okay, um so like Farrah said it's like um something um from the story that answers the question.
        - Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence. So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer.
        - So remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words.
        - Okay. So I think we've all kind of like learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume.
        - So remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text. 
        - So I thought, like, I was thinking about what you were saying, and you were telling me like I needed to look more closely at the reading.
        - Fantastic so I really appreciate coming Luis just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here.
- intent: r520.1
  examples: |
        - Great. Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine.
        - And last but not least, Farrah. What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future?
        - Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay.
        - What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking?
        - Right. that's good. that's why we're in school right? because we don't know everything. I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write.
        - Thank you. And actually, it's time for us to go to lunch, but I just wanted to say thank you for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand how we each had like a part of the answer and how to put them all together and make the best. Awesome. So to answer out there was
        - I guess I just won't go back yet.
        - Okay, bye.
        - or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these 
        - Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise?
        - How, what did you learn right? What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections? what What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this person?
        - Go back and look in the story to find your answer. 
        - Right, so you went back and read. So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information?
        - So, next time, I guess, I will write more specific names of things when I am writing my answer, so you don't have to revise and revise and revise.
        - And what about that? and when you guys are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?
        - Hi Welcome back from lunch. so we'll just pick up from where we left it. i'm Jazmin as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, 
        - we're just going to go around Jazmin. what do you think first? you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task.
        - So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second Luis, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question.
        - Okay well so me and Luis have different types of equipment, and so I feel like when you were telling them to look it over I looked at over again, and I still feel like my answer is the right one.
        - Okay, so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text circling important information, how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming?
        - yeah there were two things that you, you told us to do.
        - um Okay, so I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good.
        - You are correct. So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific, 
        - To all future questions in the text. Right. You can use that strategy over and over for the rest of your life.
        - I think, but I got a mixture of it i'm.
        - How has learning to restate a question? How can you use that that knowledge on our next lesson?
        - And how you will apply what you learned in your next task? so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering.
        - Hmm what would stick with me is that I have to say, the name of the thing.
        - Reach Every Reader:, thank you. It's time for us to go to lunch must go. But thank you for for
        - I know a lot about space, so I might still use the background knowledge, but I mean I should probably read it, because maybe I don't know everything.
        - So next time you answer a question like that. What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using, 
        - Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text. What are you going to do that.
        - Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are all the way there yet.
        - Right, ask the teacher.
        - How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down.
        - Okay, so whenever we're reading We want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question. So as we're reading, if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking
        - Yeah. Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question. We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion.
        - It's a good question. Well, the first thing I would do is I would restate the question. I would say like, okay, so if the question asked this. Then I got it.
        - Look at the story again to find a full answer.
        - So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and
        - That's right. That's excellent. So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text all the information there.
        - So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text.
        - what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text? so here i'm going to give you a new question. if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question. you ready?
        - And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future. I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook.
        -  You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence
        - What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?
        - Specific name and of the things that you described okay.
        - Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question.
        - Prompts students to transfer (e.g., "What did you learn today that will help you next time you're answering questions from the text?")
        - Alright so next time.
        - I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this. What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this.
        - So now that you've figured out the full answer. What will you do next time to when you're looking back in the text.
        - So I want you guys to make sure that when we look, we're off, we're always looking back in the text because we have to look for that small machine just like what Jazmin did. She had said that NASA sent a small machine into space, right, Jazmin?
        - So for me, what I noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete
        - I'm okay. I would say next time I see a question like this I will look for, or I'm look for evidence and the text.
        - Well I, I got my answer just from from reading the text and I looked for evidence and another thing I did was
        - So what do you think you would do next time to.
        - What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence.
        - Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at all, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge.
        - Very good. Jazmin. I think what we all need to take away is that when we're doing things we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting it annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning  and why we're learning it.
        - Unfortunately, we have to go too much, but thank you so much for people, it was really fun.
        - Okay, next time, I guess, I could just like be specific when i'm writing my answer.
        - So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question.
        - So I started by saying that it was the Microscope that they found the water with because I was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it, they couldn't find it, but when I read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water.
        - So next time we have, we're answering. Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do. 
        - And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy.
        - so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better.
        - Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said.
        - So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers.
        - Okay, what could you do next time.
        - Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question
        - And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us. And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do. 
- intent: r530.1
  examples: |
        - Okay um so for my process at first, I was just looking for.
        - Yeah, that's a really good question. I sort of thought about it.
        - Yeah. Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be. Now that we've discussed it. So what kind of helped us find our answer.
        - That's great. That's great. So what made you what, how did I change your answer? Were you thinking about that a little differently?
        - What was different about your first answer and your second you said?
        - Okay, so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer? So how did you go about correcting your answer?
        - And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote?
        - Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use. 
        - Well Okay, so you said that I needed to use details in the answer, and so, when I went and looked back in the in the reading
        - No, no, I'm not thinking differently because here you got look at this and in the text and Part six that's where I got my answer because
        - Thank you. Okay, so Jazmin do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions?
        - Okay, so what we did is we, we reread, we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment, but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question.
        - About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking. Can you go back to that? How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking
        - Yes, yes. So can you see, um, you know, how we can approach that question a little differently now that you've kind of looked at it. What's another way you might answer that question?
        - Great job everyone, so how has your thinking changed? I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity.
        - So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change?
        - And how did you find that instead of small machine it was the Lunar Orbiter. What did you do to make that change?
        - Okay Farrah, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change
        - Okay, so we started out
        - um Okay, so I knew that the microscope was the wrong answer.
        - So how can I ask you a question? how did you get from your first answer to your second answer? what was what was different and how other than just writing more? what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer?
        - mm hmm and has your thinking changed at all about how they found it? 
        - Well, I I.
        - is there anything else? did anyone do anything different when they were revising their answer?
        - OK so Luis do you want to share your new thinking? what has changed in your thinking?
        - Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage. i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer? what was different about those two?
        - You say,
        - Alright, cool Luis. so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response? a little bit more specific to what you read today. 
        - Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers?
        - I heard i'm Luis talking about the Lunar orbiter and you said to look at part two.
        - Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?
        - My first answer I just said NASA send a small machine.
        - Does anyone else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer? But now what they know is the right answer.
        - Okay, I think i'm ready. i'm before our conversation I thought, a microscope was thought right answer um and after our conversation I see that it's the Lunar orbiter.
        - Oh well. So basically, like, okay, so at first I thought like, okay, you're gonna discovers
        - i'm so sorry to interrupt you again teacher but it's time for us to go to lunch.
        - Oh Okay. well, I think what's different is I added I added the other piece, so that it had it had all the pieces, instead of just one piece.
        - Well, I added the name, so I had to master some small machine, and now it says NASA said it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter.
        - Do you see any ways does your mind kind of changing? Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your group?
        - Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, but just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think. Whatever you think it's Okay, if your response hasn't changed. it's okay if it has changed. i'm just curious what you all are thinking so take a moment before our conversation I thought this after our conversation I thought this.
        - yeah sure So my first answer once about oxygen tanks, which i'm well, I still kind of think that's true, but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so, then I found the equipment and the story, which is the machine.
        - Um you know what teacher, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on, but I was just thinking, I wanted to say.
        - Great. Does anyone else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed?
        - So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your think
        - mm hmm so let's just think about as a team. like What did we do together? what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? Oliver.
        - Okay um well, I would say to discover water on the moon scientist used a lunar orbiter with a microscope.
        - OK, so now that I have given you guys some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking.  Then, how that changed.
        - Well, I think the main thing that I I added with detail like first I added the detail of the of the object, so I didn't just say like kind of what it was I said, like specifically what was it that makes sense.
        - Great so Luis now that you're participating already. Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response?
        - Yeah, well, I think so.
        - Okay um well I started out thinking, but there wasn't gonna be there's no way that we're gonna have any water on the moon so that's not valuable, but now I think I think that they might be able to make it happen um and so part.
        - So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay.
        - Farrah. what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
        - Alright. So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response. And now I think this way because And then you can tell me. So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what.
        - Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so Luis what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have.
        - Well, I I use two sentences I use my sentence and then kind of Chris sentence and then I set it up because in there too.
        - Oliver, has that change your thinking a little bit?
        - Exactly. Luis So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning.
        - Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer. Can you help me figure out the why. So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did
        - Um, well, actually, um, I would say that what seemed to help us find our answer was all like listening to each other.
        - yeah so I want you guys to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future.
        - awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas.
        - How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think.
        - has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this Chris sorry I saw your hand was up.
        - Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you. So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now. I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank.
        - So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning.
        - So I would love to hear from Oliver Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you guys just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can.
        - Yo, yo. You started out thinking a certain way and now you think...
        - Alright so let's all think what did we learn about changing our answers today?
        - Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think.
        - Okay. So, reflect on that process what that was like.
        - Does anyone else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
        - How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently.
        - Okay, well, I thought there were astronauts um but now I know there are the astronauts, and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now I think those are the answers.
        - Prompts students to reflect (e.g., "How has your thinking changed?" or "What new information do you have now about discovery?")
        - yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that.
        - alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation.
        - So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process.
        - First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions.
