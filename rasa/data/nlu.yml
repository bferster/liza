        - that's awesome that's awesome before we get started, I want to ask, if you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a STUDENT
        - Has he told you about these kind of thing
        - Oh, that is so awesome
        - When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month
        - Does that make sense?
        - So have you STUDENT  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes
        - Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end
        - Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?
        - Have you ever seen something through a microscope
        - Yes, what thing that you see
        - Well, it sounds exciting
        - Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - Well science videos, my family
        - We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,
        - Um like a refrigerator
        - Kind of how I think about it
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade
        - I wanted to be an astronaut
        - But, you know, that was my goal
        - So obviously I didn't live up to that
        - Kennedy center, or--
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F
        - Was it fun?
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy
        - I'm gonna go back to STUDENT because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts
        - Is a while you're looking at it
        - but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?
        - Has STUDENT ever use a microscope before?
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        - To the next time
        - What do you say,
        - How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game
        - So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at
        - Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories
        - You're sitting there were at school
        - STUDENT right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know
        - So what's an equipment you have right now
        - Thats helping you with your work, STUDENT
        - But right now, you every one of your student at school, right
        - And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets
        - Now, just like when they did their research
        - You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing
        - So did you enjoy reading the passage
        - I don't want you to write down what STUDENT you know about space
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        - I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let Farrah, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and STUDENT work and share what you know about space
        - Okay, with each other, quietly okay so STUDENT can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space
        - Alright, so let's go over
        - It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close
        - Yeah, like a magnifying glass
        - How many of you have ever seen a microscope
        - All right, so STUDENT
        - Where did you see a microscope at
        - What do you want me to tell me about space STUDENT?
        - Oh you already know a lot about space
        - When I was younger, two different times and they use STUDENT kinds of really cool equipment
        - I went to NASA as well
        - I had a great time there as well
        - Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert
        - Did STUDENT else know that the moon is like a desert
        - It seems like you learned something today
        - Oh, well, that's great
        - Tell me what you know about space
        - There's STUDENT this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others
        - But if you read it
        - Where do you read it up
        - Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible
        - That's super cool
        - Anything could happen
        - Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening
        - So I mean, at this point in time and this year
        - So give me some examples of tools
        - Debbie had your hand raised
        - Can you give me an example of a tool
        - Is there STUDENT else that wanted to share a tool
        - That's absolutely right
        - What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip
        - So if you drive very far
        - You are right, think about like a gas station
        - They wouldn't get stranded
        - And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station
        - You won't run out of gas
        - And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station
        - We're not gonna turn back around, right
        - We'll just get more gas and keep going
        - Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer
        - Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher
        - So like an ant
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr Oliveron
        - We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O
        - Okay, so where we left off
        - Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope
        - Yes, you do
        - what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? STUDENT know?
        - Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not
        - that's really cool fact STUDENT, where did you read that
        - Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,
        - How did they get to the moon
        - Well, since you've gone there
        - Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there
        - That that's really cool
        - I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that
        - That's really cool
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something
        - Does STUDENT here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you
        - Is there anymore knowledge you STUDENT have
        - You went to NASA? Really?
        - Yeah, has STUDENT else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so STUDENT has as well
        - would STUDENT ever want to go to space
        - What about you, would you want to or would you not
        - The water is hiding in the craters
        - Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time
        - So you like to read
        - Do you like to garden yourself STUDENT
        - That's, I love that answer
        - You know STUDENT about space really where did you learn about space
        - Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum
        - Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older
        - You are so passionate about space
        - How is STUDENT doing please raise your hand
        - Oh, thank you, STUDENT
        - Would STUDENT else like to tell us about their day before we move forward
        - STUDENT I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter
        - So can you tell me what what do you know about space
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know
        - I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base
        - I like that shirt I have the same shirt
        - Actually, that's a really cool shirt
        - I think we STUDENT see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters
        - But we never think about how it would be to actually exist
        - There are walk around on the moon
        - So I agree with you
        - I think that's a really cool thing
        - Were you surprised STUDENT, that the scientists found water on the moon
        - I think that's what the scientists thought too
        - how about you, STUDENT
        - Were you surprised
        - How about you, STUDENT
        - Were you surprised
        - That's a really good reason to be reading current news
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new
        - How about you, STUDENT
        - So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me
        - I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night
        - I thought this was great
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there
        - STUDENT or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article
        - So STUDENT did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts
        - yeah and STUDENT like was this the spark any interest in you or yes
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on
        - awesome thanks STUDENT okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday
        - STUDENT, why do you want to go to the moon
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if STUDENT wants to share
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does STUDENT have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone
        - Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know
        - yeah so in Spanish it's Luna
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why STUDENT, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact
        - yeah STUDENT Do you know anything else about the moon
        - What about anybody else does anybody else in our STUDENT know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity
        - No way Chris that's so cool would you STUDENT like to go to the moon
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see STUDENT
        - that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible
        - what's your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - Would any of you STUDENT be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - STUDENT, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?
        - Oh, what kind of stuff did you see
        - Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon
        - Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer
        - Oh, what do you know about space
        - STUDENT could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?
        - Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish
        - STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Okay STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Great STUDENT can you teach us the Spanish word for moon
        - STUDENT have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?
        - Is space something you're interested in STUDENT?
        - and STUDENT one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon
        - Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space
        - Okay, have you ever used a microscope
        - When you STUDENT were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read
        - Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small STUDENT
        - um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it
        - But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting
        - buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah STUDENT do you have something to add?
        - Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you STUDENT responded to which was
        - that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part
        - Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space
        - Did you STUDENT like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?
        - Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with STUDENT of us?
        - I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?
        - Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you STUDENT read?
        - Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?
        - Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think?
        - i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah STUDENT
        - You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those
        - This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age
        - yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different
        - Oh does STUDENT know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know
        - um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know
        - yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like
        - Really STUDENT some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use
        - Oh that's cool STUDENT what about you Where would you go what planning, would you
        - and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o
        - Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that
        - Right you STUDENT drink water every day right
        - So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay
        - Know do you just like to read about this on your own
        - do you like like space, do you like to
        - no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right
        - So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?
        - Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry STUDENT, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon
        - yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon
        - that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024
        - Based on our reading
        - i'm STUDENT do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?
        - Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that STUDENT what were you gonna say
        - i'm not sure if you STUDENT saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if
        - I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or
        - And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh
        - He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think
        - Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space
        - STUDENT knows this, correct
        - This is STUDENT true
        - jas STUDENT you're not so interested in going to the moon
        - I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that
        - STUDENT, why are you interested in going to the moon
        - Those are really beautiful ideas, thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - Oh wow that's really interesting, are you really passionate about space
        - That seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration Maybe you can after we have our small STUDENT discussion tell us some interesting facts
        - Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to STUDENT and show us one day
        - I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment
        - yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said STUDENT made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so
        - but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that STUDENT
        - well you could be
        - Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space
        - really like space i'm also big fan of space to
        - Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned
        - They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the
        - yeah isn't that cool
- intent: r110.3
  examples: |
        - that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here STUDENT right
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers STUDENT day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever STUDENT that you're in
        - i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge
        - yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to NASA that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and I think you and STUDENT probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing
        - Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group STUDENT
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn
        - um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um STUDENT
        - Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question
        - Well, that would be awesome
        - I didn't know that you taught me something
        - So I'm glad you're here with us
        - You don't think you should be in this STUDENT
        - Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us STUDENT out with some of our questions we have and how we answered
        - So STUDENT Can you help me understand
        - I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space
        - Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we STUDENT know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way
        - You know STUDENT about space?
        - Luis, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the STUDENT when we get back with them
        - I love that you know about oxygen
        - For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks
        - I'm sure they do and I bet that STUDENT could probably tell you more and you can share that information together
        - STUDENT, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about
        - So I know that you can really help us out here
        - And I know that you know a lot about space
        - And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for STUDENT those astronauts up there
        - So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better
        - Does that sound okay
        - Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently
        - What a fun experience
        - That's a great connection
        - How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that
        - We need you in here to help help us out
        - Oh well, STUDENT, and that's exactly why we need you in here
        - Okay, thank you for that
        - Luis Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this STUDENT today since you know a lot about space
        - Now, STUDENT, our science expert
        - Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the STUDENT to learn that thing
        - Oh, you were there
        - Maybe you should tell us about in another STUDENT about everything that you did see there
        - That is really cool
        - Wow, that seems really awesome
        - That's why you know a lot about space
        - STUDENT your dad is an astronaut
        - So maybe today or in another STUDENT, you can share something that you have learned from your dad
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the STUDENT
        - You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share
        - So being in this STUDENT doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it
        - Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about
        - I'm happy to hear that
        - It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,
        - I would hope that that's the case
        - And with water here that could help us in our future exploration
        - We're very excited to see that
        - I'm glad to see you STUDENT are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge
        - We know that STUDENT did visit NASA
        - You can help me out with the other STUDENT
        - How about that once you just chill out for a minute
        - What you have STUDENT is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic
        - Awesome so STUDENT used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome
        - Awesome STUDENT, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage
        - So, and STUDENT was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment
        - Can we STUDENT agree on that
        - So what you learned there is that they're very scientific in their studies
        - And STUDENT, that's really cool
        - Well, maybe you can help the others
        - It ties, because sometimes our personal experience helps us  to understand what we're reading
        - And so that's a great thing to share with the STUDENT
        - And so STUDENT when you are reading, if you've seen these things at NASA, itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them
        - Does STUDENT else have an experience that similar?
        - Maybe they don't know it, and they need your help
        - So sometimes if you if you already know something I think we can always learn more about it
        - Or maybe you could see if your classmates
        - Well, maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions
        - Okay, that would be great
        - Thanks for for helping us out
        - Or maybe you could help us out
        - What do you think
        - So we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more
        - Well, just like last time you had something to contribute to the STUDENT
        - and you'll be able to share STUDENT your knowledge
        - And I'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you
        - So we are going to listen to our friends
        - Okay, thank you for your input
        - But every time we learn something we continue growing and learning
        - STUDENT You use very good background information
        - We know that you know about space
        - Okay, we are going to use your
        - Okay, we've talked about background knowledge in you can help us
        - With more information about what we're learning
        - Well, I think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet
        - We can always learn more, but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us
        - Right, Chris and that's sort of what STUDENT said too, right? So that's great that you're using your background knowledge
        - Well, you can help me teach the others I really need you to still be in this STUDENT so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better
        - That's very neat
        - I bet that was-- I've seen some of this equipment
        - Thank you so much, STUDENT
        - So you can help me, you know, help us learn more about it
        - Well, we can always learn new things about topics
        - Oh well, I really need you to stay in our STUDENT and and you can help me with like information and things
        - You can help you can be my helper
        - Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away
        - That is awesome that you know STUDENT the extra stuff
        - And we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your
        - Well, you know, I liked your response, the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - Okay, well, maybe you can help us
        - Have, help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is
        - Alright, well I'm glad you know STUDENT of that information
        - There's a lot of things that we need to have whenever we go into space
        - Now that's very fascinating that you were able to visit NASA
        - That's a great cultural experience and it gives you a little insight into having some prior knowledge as you move forward in your science classes
        - Now astronauts and scientists have to use STUDENT kinds of equipment and certain materials that they have to wear when they go into space because it's such an unknown area and we want to be as safe as possible
        - So when you got to see STUDENT of those things that NASA you were able to see some of the space suits, some of the tools and equipment that they use
        - Right, I'm super jealous that you had NASA but
        - maybe you can help your partner's out Luis I think you would be a great addition to our STUDENT
        - That you know STUDENT about space
        - Oh, well that's really great
        - Maybe you can add to our conversation
        - That's, that's awesome
        - But like you said, scientists do have to use oxygen up in space, so they can survive
        - And it will help you
        - I'm glad you do know stuff about oxygen tanks and things like that
        - Well, maybe you can help some of us understand things better by being in this STUDENT then
        - Um, it's always good when we have that background knowledge that we can pull in
        - But what I'd like you to do, you can help other students learn more to, would you like to do that?
        - That's great that you know that stuff
        - Yes, but you can help some of the other students
        - So let's, uh, we'll use your contribution to help help the other students as well
        - You know a lot about some of the equipment NASA uses
        - And maybe you can learn from your friends to okay
        - Right, STUDENT, so you'll be able to share some information with us
        - STUDENT What was something that you said that scientists use
        - Your right and so, STUDENT, said the same thing, right
        - Okay, well I'm so glad that you know a lot about space
        - And no, you are not wrong
        - Chris and STUDENT I think you both did a great job at may at using your outside resources
        - And I think that that's awesome
        - So different things that you've experienced in your life related to this
        - and maybe even help others learn more about science and sort of explore their own strengths within that type of knowledge
        - Well that's that's that's really cool, you know, sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come, you know, sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material
        - I'm so glad you know a lot about space because we need STUDENT the knowledge to help us, especially with these questions that we have today
        - I'm glad that you brought that up about space because that's why we're here today
        - That's a good point
        - Okay, so, and STUDENT brought up about space and I'm glad that he did that
        - Now in school right and we're learning differently
        - Alright, so let's go back to our question
        - Some things are different
        - And you STUDENT have done a great job by looking more into this because you can use some of your knowledge that you have, or you've read about NASA to help you with things like this and help our partners
        - Oh wow, that's awesome information because you know what that can help us out today about learning about the importance
        - Thank you, STUDENT, because I know that you can make some great connections about your dad because I know he has shared a lot of information about things that he has done it work
        - I bet STUDENT could confirm that about his dad probably has told him too, right Luis?
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        - You know what you gave me a great idea
        - Okay, so you do have some, some of a good foundation on space
        - It seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates
        - So when we cover more about space
        - Maybe I'll have you been one of our STUDENT leaders
        - Okay, so maybe maybe we go forward
        - So I think that means you probably have a lot, you could share with the rest of the STUDENT about some of your experience with NASA and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts
        - Okay, so maybe you and STUDENT could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space
        - Don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this STUDENT to help the rest of us
        - If you think you have a, you know, if you know a lot about space
        - And maybe we could learn from each other
        - Um, you know so much about space, let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates
        - That's really cool
        - And that obviously shows your understanding of space
        - So that's really cool that you have that experience
        - I've never been the NASA
        - Okay, so we read it aloud
        - You read it for us because you know everything about space already
        - That I love that
        - I wish I could go to NASA, but I'm very far away
        - But I think that's really cool and and i love that you STUDENT have this experience about space and you all know that there's these different types of equipment that work together so
        - I know I could tell by your answer that you really enjoy space that you know that they use oxygen tanks to be up in space and to explore up there
        - That's super cool
        - Yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about
        - And if you I would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the STUDENT
        - You do know quite a lot
        - So maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here
        - So I think, I think you're gonna help us learn some stuff too
        - Well, thank you for letting us know STUDENT
        - Hopefully one day, Kevin
        - Unless I'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well
        - So you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it
        - Well, I definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more, and even learn a little more yourself
        - And maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates
        - And like you said, I think they are planning on building a base on the moon
        - that's not referencing the text, but I do believe you are right about that
        - Maybe you can help us understand even more about space
        - So stay with this STUDENT, you might be able to help us
        - And maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students
        - This might be their first time learning about space
        - Now that could actually help out with this next question
        - Okay, we'll start over here with STUDENT
        - And needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut
        - I'm glad that you know STUDENT about space
        - Maybe you should can share some other things with your friends today while we're talking
        - wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at STUDENT
        - Classmates said don't know so your background knowledge really does help
        - Okay, thank you for using your outside knowledge to contribute to the conversation
        - Thank you, thank you for your answer, and thank you for explaining in case STUDENT didn't know
        - So even though I know you guys all know lots about space and Luis You may know more about space than everyone else in the STUDENT
        - Well, that's really cool
        - And the fact that you STUDENT know so much about space already means you definitely have some good background knowledge that you can connect
        - And they would need those on the moon
        - And I know you said you know a lot about space
        - So that is a very good response
        - I also just want to make sure, similar to Luis I know that you STUDENT have lots of knowledge about space and
        - Yeah, they definitely do use STUDENT of that equipment and that is a great answer
        - yeah that's awesome i'm glad that you have that background knowledge of what astronauts use
        - yeah that is really cool um and again that's a good example of some background knowledge that you have about the topic
        - I definitely haven't, but that is a really cool thing to to share with the STUDENT
        - Yeah, that's really cool that you got to experience that
        - I bet not STUDENT has
        - Absolutely good job way to think outside of the text
        - all right awesome job STUDENT I like that you didn't
        - have to use the text there's a ton of other equipment that scientists used
        - And this one you thought about using your knowledge of NASA
        - Maybe I might have to go there soon
        - I went to NASA
        - I wish, I wish
        - Because we'd love to have you here, your expertise could help us STUDENT as well okay okay so um we'll start off with
        - So you know a lot about space and you think that your answer was good, of how you know
        - And you know what an oxygen tank is and you know STUDENT the equipment they use
        - Some final words like oxygen
        - See you already have some background knowledge on this
        - So you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for
        - I like what you STUDENT came up with
        - but you STUDENT have some background knowledge and it's really good
        - That really helps us build on what we're learning
        - STUDENT, I want to thank you for sharing your personal experience with us
        - So you also had a great answer, scientists can use a lot of things
        - So you've seen that they can use a lot of things
        - And like you said you know a lot about space
        - So the more we continue reading about it, the more we can learn about it
        - and also if we continue our readings outside of STUDENT, we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space
        - that's a really good connection, so the note the news that you're hearing outside of the text so yeah this equipment will definitely help them get there, thank you for adding that
        - Yeah, that's great background knowledge to bring to the table
        - So I that's great that you have really good knowledge about NASA, which can come in handy in the future,
        - We're looking for something to find it, but that as a good point, thank you for sharing
        - and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space
        - No okay well see I told you we're going to teach me something about space that I didn't know and there, it is nice job
        - that's really cool I appreciate you telling us and teaching the rest of our students that fact that's a really cool fact
        - You probably do know a lot about space
        - That's really good that you know all those things, STUDENT
        - It's really interesting
        - Those are really good things to know
        - yeah that's awesome and um hopefully you can bring some of that knowledge into today's lesson i'm excited about that
        - I know you know STUDENT about space I'm, I'm sure you all know a lot about space
        - So I think you should stay with us
        - Now you can help the rest of your friends, learn about space too
        - Okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already, but I think you should stay, so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates
        - Does that sound okay?
        - Well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space, but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too
        - Describe your intro, which is awesome because I could tell that you know so much about scientists and space
        - right they do so you, it seems like everyone in this STUDENT has a lot of background information about space, which is great, so you probably, when reading this article, connected a lot to it which is really great, but when we looked at the text, it said
        - Right I love that you have some background information on that STUDENT that's great
        - It's great that you have background knowledge, though
        - Right, so that actually has to do with like the second question is great that you know that, and you can use that background knowledge
        - What do you think?
        - Oh, maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it
        - Thank you for saying the exact names
        - And I love hearing what you've experienced
        - Well, that's exactly what I'm looking for, because you've been to NASA, you know STUDENT about it, but I haven't
        - So I think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our STUDENT
        - Well, you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of I might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with
        - So that's really cool
        - Thank you for sharing
        - And I'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell
        - And maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit, we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places, like maybe Luis's read other books about space, and you've been to NASA
        - And that's OK, sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper
        - And maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit
        - You'd be a really great resource for us
        - So why don't you hang tight
        - i'm so glad that you know a lot about space, but I think you staying in our STUDENT would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good
        - yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard
        - Do you know what since you know so much about space when you talk to your partners, you can tell them a little bit more of what you know
        - But I need
        - Well, honestly, I think that you could be a great resource for your STUDENT members and you could help them, maybe like come up with our own answers, or maybe tell them what you think to
        - uh huh oh that's cool yeah
        - That's really cool
        - Well, I love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to NASA before
        - But it's really great that you know a lot about space that's going to be really helpful with how you answer the questions
        - Okay, so we're going to work on that
        - That would be really cool and maybe we would see some of the stuff that we're reading about actually taking place and we have STUDENT this knowledge about it now because we read about it
        - You're right, they do use a lot of different equipment
        - But - And I really enjoyed like how you use your background knowledge to help you support this
        - Because like you said you know a lot about space
        - But I think STUDENT by you being here, you can use - your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing, because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment
        - yeah, so I think you're right like because you went to NASA you're able to use your background knowledge and you're able to build off of what you already know
        - that's a really, really cool that's really interesting, I wonder, if it will happen, maybe it won't
        - Well, I'm glad you know a lot about space already because we know background knowledge is very important
        - So maybe there's a few things that you could share with us that you know that may be myself or the other students might not know
        - And you could help us to understand better
        - I'm glad you brought that up your background knowledge
        - that's very good that you have all this like information in your head, so I feel like well I don't know about the rest of the STUDENT, but maybe you would have a better and a better answer to go so
        - That's great that you have that background knowledge
        - I mean, that's great
        - I think that's really, really important
        - I really appreciate you adding that to the conversation
        - So did you bring in that background knowledge that you already knew?
        - So you can share your answers with the rest of the STUDENT because maybe someone might not know as well as you do
        - and maybe you can help me help the students to figure out how we can get them to really dive into the text
        - So that's a very good observation
        - I mean, obviously you need oxygen to survive
        - Space is so cool and I'm so glad that it's a passion of yours
        - They use STUDENT of that
        - That's really great
        - So that's what we would call background knowledge
        - That's stuff that you know before even reading the article, and that's really awesome
        - You know all about space, STUDENT?
        - Oh that's very cool STUDENT
        - And thinking about the other equipment that they might use
        - You're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us, you're thinking outside of the box
        - Right, so you really are thinking outside of the box
        - Well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new
        - Thank you for sharing that though
        - You never know
        - That you know STUDENT about space
        - So you can definitely help add in different things that we may have not even known or not discussed in the article
        - You do know a lot about space
        - I hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon
        - I'm sure it is
        - I can tell you have a lot of background information on space based on your answer
        - but you can certainly help even with your background knowledge
        - STUDENT I hope that after today's discussion, you can go home and you can talk to him about some of the ideas that we come up with in our discussion about water on the moon
        - Well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the STUDENT, so you might find some use there
        - Good I will, I am glad that you're able to think about another experience that helps you relate to the text
        - but I am so glad that you are passionate about this subject that's going to help us
        - You know so much in your brain about space
        - STUDENT You're totally right
        - You definitely have knowledge on this subject
        - But I think that background knowledge that you have inside your brain is going to be a huge help
        - So STUDENT, it sounds like you know a lot about equipment that NASA uses
        - Maybe you can help your other classmates in if they have any questions they may ask you
        - So maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge
        - Great it look like you're an expert in our STUDENT
        - Wow, great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our group, so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding, or STUDENT the things they want to know, okay?
        - Teacher : Right, so I don't disagree that you can learn a lot from YouTube, have boats, the scientists and astronauts and rockets
        - So that's really cool that you've been to NASA and you have STUDENT this background knowledge
        - That's all really interesting information STUDENT
        - I know I'm sure you do
        - I know you have a lot of background information on that since you've read so many books
        - I'm sure see movies or tv shows
        - Well, then you can help us in talking about space since you are ready and ready to go
        - Right, so that's so cool that you have that extra information
        - Oh wow, that's so cool STUDENT
        - How, what it does to look for the water
        - Until then, you might be able to help me in telling me what the lunar orbiter does how it looks
        - You do know so many different pieces of equipment that NASA uses
        - So, you, you, you're right
        - Well, good, then you can help maybe our other friends understand some more about the water on the moon, like the text that we read, so I'm going to ask a quick question
        - Oh wow, I'm so impressed that you know that that's awesome STUDENT,
        - Wow, to know STUDENT about space, you must know a lot
        - Maybe that you can teach the rest of us about
        - So interesting, maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer
        - Okay, I know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space
        - Because those are things that we might not know, but because you have that experience with NASA you're able to share that with us and I really appreciate it
        - STUDENT I think it's awesome that you know so much about space and I really appreciate you sharing that with me,
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right
        - We STUDENT seem to know a lot about space and about NASA um
        - Thank you for sharing with us
        - I really appreciate you sharing that with me
        - Wow that's so cool
        - Well, thank you for sharing that i'm really glad that you have all of this background knowledge already, and maybe you can help others in our STUDENT today
        - wow that's awesome I love that you have that background knowledge
        - Already, so maybe you can teach us
        - You can tell us about it
        - Well, you're right
        - STUDENT and I really value that you have knowledge about this topic
        - Yeah I know but maybe you can help us
        - You can give us more information
        - Yeah, um, it's definitely good that you have that understanding and that you're confident in your knowledge about space
        - Well, thank you, STUDENT, that will definitely help our conversation
        - So thanks again for work
        - Well, that's actually awesome that you know about space because maybe you might you might know some things that you you your classmates don't even know
        - So you can help, help me teach them about space and you might even learn some new things too
        - Well, you know, that's I'm glad you reiterate that, again, STUDENT, because since you're the expert, we may be coming back to you
        - To help us with some information that might not even be in the text
        - So you might be able to help us add some additional info but
        - Or is it something else that I actually can see in the text
        - We have a lot of experts in this STUDENT
        - So the next that thank you for adding that so STUDENT, you got, we have a
        - That's such a cool thing to hear about
        - And I'm so glad that's one of the coolest things I've heard in a long time
        - Well, you know, I know that because last night we met with our class and we learned STUDENT about what you were interested in
        - So we're really glad you're here because you can really help us
        - And so we I know STUDENT you know a lot about this
        - and also, you can help share share some stuff with other people in the STUDENT
        - yeah definitely scientists use a lot of equipment, especially, especially when they're going into space right
        - I appreciate that, and you know I I really look forward to using some of your knowledge to you know help grow our students knowledge
        - STUDENT you know what
        - gosh I know that STUDENT you know you, you know a lot about space and you've learned a lot about space,
        - Luis you know I certainly welcome your input about space and i'm excited to learn about what you've learned about space, I think that we can STUDENT certainly learn from one another and
        - And you know i'm excited actually STUDENT to learn, you know from you and you learn from one another,
        - Oh, then you can explain to your classmate then before you leave then
        - or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on
        - yeah you do know a lot about space
        - but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space
        - Yes, that is, I love that you already know a lot about space STUDENT
        - Maybe you can help us with a couple things STUDENT
        - yeah that's very true STUDENT, I, like the vocabulary word geology you used, could you tell our friends, what the word geology means because you could you help us figure out what that word means
        - Oh well, Luis that's awesome because you know what I had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this STUDENT
        - And that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson
        - yeah that's that's pretty crazy too thanks for sure that STUDENT i'm glad we have such a space expert here, so I was really excited to talk to you about this say I read a little bit about
        - cool always so interesting to apply your outside knowledge to what we're learning in STUDENT
        - Oh excellent I cannot wait to hear all that you know about space let's talk a little bit more about that STUDENT
        - that's awesome Luis that you have previous experience you know it's really important that in our STUDENT, we work together so maybe you can help out your classmates to understand this text, a little bit better
        - yeah awesome that's that's a really great description of a space suit i'm really glad you have that experience STUDENT
        - I know you already know a lot about space, but not STUDENT has necessarily had that experience um, can you tell us -
        - yeah and that's amazingly important background knowledge that you know, we need to keep in our brain, especially one more understanding of what's going on and trying to see  How the scientists are able to find water on the moon
        - Right, and I think it's great that you're bringing your knowledge from STUDENT the studies that you've done on space, which is amazing
        - yeah and I think that's great I think bringing your own first hand experience is wonderful and that's exactly what you should be doing
        - Oh well, that's great but we're you can help STUDENT else
        - Who maybe hasn't had as much experience learning about spaces you, you can share what you know with the STUDENT
        - that's awesome so in your answer, it would be great if you could tell me a little bit more about your experience going to NASA and maybe tie that in to the article
        - Because the fact that you were able to include your own experience in there is really awesome
        - Okay, well, it sounds like you know a lot about space, but you can stick around in this group, just to help STUDENT else learn what you know
        - Absolutely, and that I think that that would isn't, I mean STUDENT else might agree as well that that's an amazing inference right, you can think about
        - Yes, absolutely, and so I and that's why i'm so excited to have STUDENT of you in this group, because all of you bring such a great
        - Like minds that you bring like i'm you touched on what Luis said about the mask I mean it was said about the oxygen tanks STUDENT those things are so important
        - that's great well, thank you for hanging out with us anyway so we're going to rely on your expertise to help us even thanks so much
        - NASA as the United States Space Agency, and so in this paragraph STUDENT you're right and I like that you have that background information, but I want you to look back into paragraph two
        - So it's awesome that you already have some background knowledge in this topic
        - Right now we're just focusing on text based evidence
        - Thank you for the enthusiasm STUDENT about space
        - I wish I could have experienced that
        - Wow, thank you STUDENT for sharing that incredible experience
        - um I think it's good to talk about this what we read together, so we can help us help each other understand it more
        - Maybe you can share that with us
        - So it's great that you know a lot about space
        - That's a that's a great connection that you made with the reading
        - yeah wow thanks for sharing that
        - Oh, that is awesome STUDENT i'm so glad you are so interested in space, could you help maybe me, and some of your classmates learn a little about how we discover water on the moon, do you know how we do
        - whoa whoa that sounds really exciting that definitely sounds exciting but definitely some you had some great things about there
        - You are so right STUDENT yeah so in Houston here we have NASA too, and it is really cool really there
        - Okay STUDENT so we'll definitely be able to use some of your expertise in this conversation
        - so you'll be able to use your background knowledge to really help us understand
        - awesome so let's come back together right? STUDENT shared with us his amazing background knowledge, he knows a lot about space and astronauts and when they go up to space
        - what, yes STUDENT
        - Alright, good afternoon students, I was just reading over your responses and what I noticed is that you STUDENT are doing a really great job answering the question, especially using some of the background knowledge that you know about space and about the moon
        - that's great and I love that you already know a lot about space, but what I think is
        - Yes, and these are amazing tools and requirements that they have to be wearing before they go there
        - That is so awesome that you are telling me how knowledgeable you are now how motivated, you are in terms of subjects, so I can't really I can't wait to hear your response, and in fact I already heard you
        - Absolutely I love that you're making connections and that's so fascinating that you've been there and never been to another place, though
        - Oh that's incredible I mean it really shows from your response that you really enjoyed a science and to begin with
        - Oh wow you did a superior job like telling me STUDENT that background knowledge I love that how you visited there and site and how it made a big impact on you
        - Oh wow that's an incredible information I love that you're sharing the resource with us
        - that's fantastic that means you have an amazing schema which means you've lots of background information about space and that's going to help us today
        - Which is great i'm so excited that you have so many facts up there in your brain
        - You already know all about space that makes me so happy because we're going to be able to use your knowledge as an expert about space to help teach the rest of our group, so i'm going to definitely be relying on you STUDENT
        - So thank you for sharing that with me before we get started
        - yeah absolutely and i'm loving that i'm getting to spend some time with just the five of you, and I think we can all really learn from each other, like I mentioned earlier, with STUDENT
        - yeah absolutely I love that you made a connection to your own personal experience STUDENT and you were able to realize
        - Oh, of course, Luis, but we all want to benefit from your expertise, so you know we we like the opportunity to be able to to have you in the STUDENT, so that we can ask you some questions, what did you think about the Lunar orbiter
        - that's a really good point I you know I wish the article would have talked about that, I guess, I guess, sometimes the
        - it's incredible isn't it STUDENT
        - STUDENT we need some space expertise and so it's always good to have you in the room anytime we're talking about space
        - But one of the reasons that I wanted to to have you here, besides the fact that you're our in house space expert
        - that's right that's right well you know i'm glad that you recognize STUDENT that it's this is
        - that's great STUDENT I love that you're interested in space Maybe you can share your knowledge with the rest of the students
        - that's very cool I have not been to NASA i've always wanted to go that's really cool that you got to go
        - You went to NASA that's really amazing, and I think your contribution is also valuable, but right now let's try to find out the answer to the question that we're looking for
        - Oh, you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this STUDENT, because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space
        - but thank you so much for sharing what you know about the equipment that is available at NASA
        - So maybe STUDENT, you can kind of help us here, then
        - You can maybe be our expert in the STUDENT and help the rest of us, what do you think about that?
        - You know I know you know about space, I saw your response, about the oxygen tanks, which is awesome because
        - Do I do i'm sure you do, you probably know a lot more about space and idea my son is actually named STUDENT as well, so I feel like we got that connection already what's um I don't know when I was your age I loved space, so I was particularly excited to read this article
        - That it's pretty amazing
        - Really Okay, so why don't you help us out what can you tell us a couple of things that you read in that article that you might have already known
        - STUDENT I am sure you know a lot about space, but I was wondering, we were looking for the answer to the question
        - Thank you so much for sharing this sounds like you're a NASA expert will probably come back to you and get some more information, whenever we're looking for some of your expertise, thank you STUDENT
        - that's so great to hear that we have people here that are interested in space,
        - so i'm really going to value your opinion STUDENT
        - that's pretty soon from now exactly
        - yeah STUDENT your answer really showed me that you have a lot of background knowledge
        - Well i'm glad you know a lot about space, and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our STUDENT conversation
        - Well, I, hopefully, you can use what you know about space to answer the question, but I want us to think
        - yeah yeah scientists do need to use a lot of equipment or tools or machines to find and uncover things
        - yeah I noticed that you have very specific details on oxygen tanks, which is really cool did you just
        - awesome I love that you spend time to learn about science outside of STUDENT that's really impressive
        - yeah they do use a lot of equipment for many different things
        - You know STUDENT about space so cool
        - Alright, so they definitely use a lot of equipment and it's so cool that you've gone to NASA that's amazing
        - that's great you must read a lot about space, you must learn a lot about it
        - Okay, great, and if you have anything to add in about your background knowledge we'd love to hear it okay
        - that's right yeah so just like STUDENT was saying there's a lot of equipment when you're out in space
        - wow that's so cool so they have a lot of equipments, as you have mentioned, yeah
        - Well, so, as you just said about yourself you're really an expert in this, and I really appreciate that you um
        - that's amazing i'm so glad that you're bringing in your background knowledge
        - yeah that's super true
        - Yes, that is so true and STUDENT you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right
        - Well i'm excited for you to share STUDENT your knowledge with your other classmates
        - mm hmm yeah you're right yeah I think there haven't been astronauts on the moon, for a little while but they definitely NASA does send astronauts, I think, to the international space station regularly
        - that's really cool that sounds like an awesome trip Paris and thanks for sharing yeah STUDENT
        - Oh nice it sounds like you know a lot about the equipment that scientists are wearing on their bodies
        - me yeah no you're so right that sounds like a really cool trip to NASA and you're right that scientists at NASA use a lot of different equipment
        - and if you have STUDENT that knowledge i'd love for you to share it with the rest of us, so I really appreciate you being here yeah
        - Well, maybe you can help us out today I think we're going to need some help as we just take a deeper look at the text
        - Does that sound good?
        - That is great that you bring so much knowledge to this STUDENT Luis and hopefully your knowledge can help the group to understand more about space as well,
        - yeah so that's great you bringing in outside information and love that very exciting and can help us have a bigger picture of what we're looking at
        - Because we want to make sure that What we're talking about STUDENT has the same basis, understanding and you have outside understanding from NASA which is amazing
        - that's amazing so you will be able to help us navigate this question
        - that's great I love, how you have so much background information about NASA and what tools they use
        - yeah that's great again I love the background info
        - yeah that's definitely really cool and i'm excited to see that
        - Oh yeah I remember our conversation from last time, when you were talking about how much you know about space definitely well
        - yeah you're absolutely correct they do use STUDENT that equipment
        - Yes, I remember you talking about how much you know about NASA and space and you think you've shared some interesting facts with us last time
        - you're right they do use STUDENT of those pieces of equipment, I want you to not let's not answer out loud, but I just want you to think about
        - Oh, maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us?
        - Do you want to share one thing with us that you know about space
        - Oh i'm so excited you know a lot about space STUDENT you know I noticed that
        - Absolutely, I think that we could probably come up with a really long list if we used our brains and thought about every single little thing that they might need a might need
        - yeah that's great and so that fuel is really necessary STUDENT I know you know, a ton about outer space, and so you probably know that we need to fuel these rockets to get around outer space and so
        - Oh well, that's great so you can actually help our STUDENT and share everything that you know so that that's a great um you are a great addition to the group
        - yeah that's actually I love that you brought that background knowledge with you and we can definitely add that into our answer
        - that's pretty cool, then you can you can be the reporter slash facilitator discussion leader, for your small group discussion is that STUDENT right
        - um how about you just maybe stay with us as a mentor or a specialist
        - By 2024 yeah, that is, but I think it's totally possible
        - Well, Luis, if that's the case um you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space is that STUDENT right
        - Oh STUDENT, you know a lot of our space
        - Oh yeah it's so great you've been to NASA
        - Well, even then, then you can sit with us to help the other students help understand the text a bit more
        - I guess what, if you could use some of what you know about space and maybe share that with the STUDENT?
        - you I bet you could definitely add a lot of a lot of strengths this STUDENT, a lot of knowledge to this group
        - yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it STUDENT, so that's- Now, if the question had asked about your personal experience, then you could mention what you had seen at NASA, that would be very interesting for sure, ok?
        - You are awesome you know a lot about the stage and equipment yeah
        - But you STUDENT did a really, really good job because you have their fantastic knowledge about space and about moon
        - awesome i'm so excited that you know about space, therefore, you can share your knowledge with the STUDENT and help us grow
        - Beautiful I love that you have that background knowledge now we're going to try and take that back now rock background knowledge and connected to the text
        - and I would love to hear what you think about space
        - People don't either So even if you don't need help you can still okay tell us some facts about
        - Maybe help your friends oh OK
        - I haven't heard that so that's really interesting and that was that was good that you were like using what you found in this text along with what you already heard before so very interesting
        - You do okay well you know what that's good because I don't know STUDENT about space and i'm sure some of your friends don't either, so you can be here to help us
        - yeah no exactly, and that was really good that STUDENT brought up that they use on oxygen tanks, because it didn't say it in the text, but in order to be out in space, you would need an oxygen tank
        - Well that's actually really good that you say that STUDENT so since you actually know a lot about space, hopefully, you can help us in our peers get to the final answer How does that sound?
        - that's great you know it's at times it's actually good that you say that the more that you have knowledge on space, you know I think it's better to help us with
        - that's good that you actually went to NASA you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool
        - For sure yeah that's great that's great that's a great connection
        - Fantastic then you'll be able to contribute in ways that will move the rest of the STUDENT Thinking forward i'm glad you're here
        - yeah and I think I love that you're coming to this with some background information from your own life and
- intent: r150.1
  examples: |
        - So we STUDENT as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right? All right
        - Does that sound okay
        - Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah STUDENT
        - yeah so STUDENT we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis
        - Absolutely absolutely so you guys, STUDENT I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means
        - Does STUDENT have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples
        - Does that make sense to everybody does STUDENT have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def
        - Does that make sense?
        - Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we STUDENT understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is
        - does that make sense?
        - [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today
        - So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers
        - So we have a lot of different answers
        - So let's look back in our texts
        - Let's think about it
        - And let's see if we had the best answer
        - Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question
        - So did STUDENT talk about that? Let's see
        - Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said
        - So do you understand how we could improve your answer?
        - So that makes sense?
        - STUDENT have any questions about that question?
        - Alright, so I have gathered you STUDENT here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed
        - Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers
        - so and you STUDENT had varying levels of understanding
        - And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow
        - Um, Farrah and STUDENT
        - Did you STUDENT get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer
        - And I don't think you had
        - Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,
        - Guess that's STUDENT that I have unless you have some questions
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused
        - How Does STUDENT feel after you read that passage
        - Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right
        - So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?
        - But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have STUDENT those same answers about the water too
        - STUDENT, it's totally okay when you just-
        - So, that's okay
        - So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them
        - Do you know what that means
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?
        - What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?
        - There's always things you can learn
        - You STUDENT see that?
        - So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you STUDENT about your answers that you guys put For question number one
        - Yeah, I want you STUDENT to just look at the question
        - And I want you to keep that in your mind
        - Just a minute
        - Does that make sense
        - So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is
        - Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?
        - So what did we, what did we look at and very closely
        - Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response
        - Did you have questions
        - Let's look at that
        - Hey STUDENT, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me
        - So let's take a quick look at our responses
        - I think you may still be confused STUDENT
        - Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something
        - The moon and we are going to share our answers
        - So let's talk about your answers you already read the article
        - In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there
        - So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to
        - But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article
        - So you kind of see where we went wrong?
        - Today, Luis, and hopefully we STUDENT can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today
        - Thank you for your help
        - What was the Oh, pardon me, Chris, STUDENT
        - And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so STUDENT
        - So that's good
        - That's an area we can improve
        - And you think you've got it out
        - So there were some room for
        - Does that make sense
        - So hey STUDENT reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff
        - You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any
        - Does that make sense
        - Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question
        - Alright STUDENT, any more questions can be any other way
        - So I'm Chris or STUDENT, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer
        - So did STUDENT, did everyone read that with her
        - Did you read that STUDENT with her? Okay
        - STUDENT, id you read that you
        - STUDENT So maybe we could look at this together
        - Appreciate that answer
        - And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        - But let's talk about this for just a minute
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way
        - And so STUDENT corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today
        - We're going to talk about our
        - Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers
        - Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever
        - So we answered our last question
        - So we're going to move on to a new question
        - Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done
        - Alright, so let's look at the question, right
        - And let's look at your answers
        - Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer
        - Does that make sense?
        - Are there any more questions
        - Yeah, so I understand
        - And I feel like you guys were STUDENT around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer
        - That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text
        - So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for
        - Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading
        - What do you STUDENT have questions about so
        - So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example
        - So they're using STUDENT those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to
        - So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to
        - Does STUDENT see that sentence
        - So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking
        - Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a STUDENT, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different
        - So we are going to think a little bit
        - Okay, so, reflecting in our answer
        - Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject
        - Okay, don't feel it's wrong
        - Thank you for for your input
        - Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more
        - And you can connect that with what you are learning
        - Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA
        - Does STUDENT else have any questions about their answer
        - So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does
        - You STUDENT think so?
        - Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing
        - You STUDENT found in the article
        - And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today
        - So I really liked reading STUDENT of your answers
        - Yeah, you got it?
        - So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers
        - Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so
        - So remember back to our question
        - We just have to find convincing evidence for its value
        - And like you said, we've done that
        - We have tons of ways that it can be used
        - I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question
        - Does that make sense?
        - So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood
        - Think we STUDENT should be here
        - So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments
        - Okay, STUDENT, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer
        - And that's what we're doing right now in this STUDENT
        - We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers
        - Does that sound good
        - See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence
        - I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody
        - Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route
        - I'm going to look at your responses, real quick
        - In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time
        - And that's a good response so
        - So let's think a little bit deeper about that
        - And so, so we've decided and
        - we have a lot of good information
        - Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to Luis to you read and see if you can find something different than STUDENT
        - Does that answer your question, STUDENT
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit
        - And let's just see where we get
        - Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there
        - Did you read it for me
        - How about you, STUDENT
        - and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words
        - And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future
        - Well, we might can look just a little bit closer
        - Would that be okay?
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you STUDENT
        - Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use
        - That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track
        - So what machine discovered water
        - But we could have made it just a little bit more detail
        - So do you understand how your answer was right
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better
        - Does that make sense now
        - Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter
        - So really good job, you STUDENT, but there are some more that we can look at
        - We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it
        - Alright, so you have STUDENT shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here
        - That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn
        - Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn
        - So the question is asking us
        - So you've STUDENT shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question
        - Now, if STUDENT five of us can agree upon one response
        - Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole STUDENT response
        - So STUDENT five of us
        - We STUDENT have I heard some really great answers
        - Well, I think there's always room
        - To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses
        - Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was
        - And your responses
        - I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Do you know how you could have
        - Does that make sense?
        - Do you not remember reading that part
        - And so the water that they found is microscopic
        - Do we know what the word microscopic means?
        - STUDENT, do you know what microscopic mean? No?
        - But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more
        - Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it
        - And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space
        - I noticed we kind of had a
        - Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon
        - Very in range of responses
        - Some of STUDENT kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off
        - And then I noticed that you put the same answer as STUDENT
        - So does that make sense to you
        - And then we can kind of talk it through
        - I think that makes sense
        - Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses
        - Alright so this event and Divya What do y'STUDENT think is all kind of had the same answer
        - Does that make sense
        - Once we've talked about it some more, um,
        - That is pretty cool
        - You'll have to go home and show him this article
        - And so I'm going to pull back up your responses
        - So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers
        - Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article
        - I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?
        - Who told you that, that's not true
        - I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art
        - We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say
        - We were able to clarify that
        - That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information
        - That makes sense? Okay
        - And when you said a small machine
        - And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you STUDENT share with me your responses on the question
        - Does that make sense to you STUDENT
        - Does that make sense
        - Okay? Does that make sense?
        - Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a STUDENT
        - Does that make sense
        - Does STUDENT have any questions
        - STUDENT, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning
        - And that may be the case
        - I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question is,
        - If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer
        - So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?
        - OK, so the Lunar Orbiter
        - To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have
        - Okay, so she brought up
        - Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it
        - And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing
        - You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like STUDENT and I'm sure to the rest of you
        - We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered
        - The same thing discovers like a verb
        - You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today
        - And once you run it
        - And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb
        - A lot of you are doing it
        - It's going to connect you back
        - When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for
        - And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event STUDENT, sorry
        - So we, we read the text
        - Did STUDENT understand the text water on the moon
        - Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?
        - Let's great STUDENT Maybe you can share some
        - Some ideas with us about the article
        - Okay, so I'm happy that y'STUDENT are all here today and I was looking over your responses
        - And that's okay
        - We're going to look back at the paragraph
        - I know that some of STUDENT had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper
        - So we're looking over your responses
        - We just want to be able to give the best answer
        - So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more
        - That he gave us
        - I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits
        - Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that
        - So we got the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's work on formulate this sentence together
        - Does STUDENT have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment
        - So what other
        - That's good, that's good
        - And you STUDENT answered in your journal some questions
        - So we STUDENT, we all just read water on the moon
        - And I want to start
        - And I saw your previous journal entry
        - So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Does that make sense
        - Does that make sense
        - You can do it, I believe you can do it
        - But then your answer is gonna be awesome
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - So I'm going To the question and your answer really quick
        - Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new
        - You already know STUDENT about space
        - can we now see why that makes sense
        - I think you STUDENT have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there
        - Why don't you stick with us
        - All right, well, STUDENT
        - And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space
        - So why don't you stick with us and
        - See what you can learn today
        - Let's, let's look at those two
        - So if nobody has any other equipment
        - answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question
        - So does that make sense as to why
        - STUDENT, I saw your hand go up
        - So does that make sense
        - Give you just a moment
        - And when you're done, give me a thumbs up or raise your hand
        - So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one
        - Well, let's double check our answers
        - The way that it's asking us to
        - That way we know for sure that we have answered the question
        - There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers
        - Is STUDENT done reading
        - About 10 more seconds
        - So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to STUDENT look back to the
        - So you STUDENT have already came up with an answer to this question
        - And who knows, you might even learn something new, as
        - It doesn't hurt to learn a little more right
        - So I looked over STUDENT of your answers for the question
        - And I wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers
        - I'm excited to work with you STUDENT
        - So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers
        - Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text
        - But we're all in this STUDENT to work on answering some questions
        - Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space
        - Okay, Jazmin, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and STUDENT
        - So our question that was posed to us
        - We're going to take a look at that
        - Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person
        - Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text,
        - STUDENT are you looking at, paragraph two, there
        - Does that make sense
        - It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we
        - I have a favorite word
        - I want you to well fake it and see what happens
        - If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction
        - I don't want you to have those feelings in my STUDENT, even if you're not confident
        - Does that make sense
        - If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together
        - I hear that you STUDENT have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart
        - Well, the first three paragraphs, the answers in there somewhere,
        - What do you guys believe what do you think Farrah, and STUDENT?
        - Is the answer in there, or is that just a partial answer in there
        - Does that make sense you three
        - but I believe we've had just a little bit of misunderstanding
        - Does that make sense, just a little bit
        - We can easily
        - we just need to take it a little bit further,
        - I'd actually like if we stayed together as a STUDENT
        - I like the small STUDENT dynamic, would you mind staying with us and following along,
        - Okay, does STUDENT else have any questions so far?
        - Well, I think we're STUDENT going to work together to form a deeper understanding of the article
        - Does STUDENT have any questions remaining about that
        - And just for a second, let's examine what Farrah and STUDENT just said
        - Okay and STUDENT So you have read the text right the text that is water on the moon?
        - Okay, and you did read the text, right, which was water is a valuable resource
        - Alright, so STUDENT you did really well with your response and I'm with the text, but I have a couple questions when to help us further our knowledge and understanding of the texts
        - Are you STUDENT ready
        - Okay, but um and I appreciate that you know so much about this, but at the same time, we can always learn more
        - So why don't you stick with us and we'll see what we can discover together
        - I just want to talk to you about some of your responses
        - And let's see if we can dig a little deeper
        - And you STUDENT had some really great responses
        - Does STUDENT agree with this?
        - Well, it's always good to go back and review things that you've learned
        - Okay, does STUDENT else have any questions before we begin,
        - STUDENT right, we're going to learn some more stuff
        - Okay, so you hang with us and we'll learn STUDENT kinds of new things
        - And we want to make sure that we're using everything to answer the questions
        - I sometimes STUDENT is just in groups to kind of talk more about it doesn't mean you did anything wrong
        - But there's some answers that maybe can be just
        - Give more information to
        - What did you think
        - His answer is not that you guys answered anything wrong at STUDENT, just to kind of think more about it
        - Yeah definitely writing more and reading very close in the text and looking for because that was a very small piece of information that was very easy to skim over
        - And it was definitely tricky to find and it would maybe take even reading it a couple times to find that
        - is just a STUDENT to talk about the questions they don't mean anything specific
        - We're just going to try and adjust the sentences
        - Just a little bit
        - Does that make sense
        - So you're in this group because I wanted you STUDENT to kind of work together and hear each other's answers and kind of
        - Okay let's talk about it, then what to do right STUDENT
        - But I just want to talk with you guys a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that STUDENT understands the water on the moon text
        - To the text, but I want to talk a little bit about how STUDENT responded after reading the text and I just want to kind of ask one more time
        - Does that make sense
        - If you have any questions, let me know
        - yeah you do know a lot about space um and I don't want to say that this STUDENT is for people who don't know about space, because you all did a really good job, but this group is just to work on giving responses to questions from a text
        - i'll start with STUDENT
        - So i'm gonna go one by one and give you each some feedback on what you said to the response
        - Does that make sense?
        - hey you really know what you're talking about, and it also shows that you found your answer from the text
        - Does that make sense, STUDENT?
        - Does that make sense
        - Does that make a little more
        - hi everyone, so I really appreciate you STUDENT, giving your responses to our second discussion question which was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable, so I want to just talk through each of your responses
        - Does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused
        - Does hat makes sense, so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there
        - Okay awesome um so STUDENT do you have any questions about your response
        - yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes STUDENT
        - Oh no, it's not anything like that, I'm sure you STUDENT have your own great knowledge of space
        - Do you STUDENT remember the passage about water on the moon?
        - We're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage
        - So we're just going to go over so you STUDENT get a bit of a more clear understanding of this passage
        - So does STUDENT understand that now from the passage?
        - Okay, does that make sense?
        - So does STUDENT else have anything that they were confused about?
        - Does STUDENT else have questions on the passage?
        - But do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer?
        - That was a really good thing to - if I asked about anything you needed to go to the moon, that would be a great part of your response
        - Do you need a reminder of what the question was?
        - If you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment, we can come back to you and I can move on to STUDENT again
        - Do you understand that?
        - Um, so you STUDENT read a text water on the moon, and we're gonna be talking about what you said like your responses
        - That's good, that's good
        - Oh, well, you know, STUDENT learn something new, no matter how much you know about it
        - There's always something to learn about something
        - Um, STUDENT, anyone else have any questions before we start? Alright, sounds good
        - Yes, those are perfect things to add, um, do you have any other questions before we move on?
        - yeah it's good good good to hear, so I brought you STUDENT, and you know it's a as a group, because you guys all had very various answers to the prompts
        - Oh well, you know the the greatest minds in the world, always always now I learned something new, every day, so you know you try give it a shot, you know, keep an open mind to it
        - so do you have any questions for me on that well
        - um do you have any do you have any questions about that, so far, well, I just i'm gonna try to write it down, so I was trying to remember what you said
        - So we'll be talking about your responses to the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable um so first of all I your I like your responses all they're all different, and I like that so what's what's taught was start with STUDENT so you're your
        - Oh come on stick around for a while, but you can learn something new from this, you know some i'm almost 20 years old, and I was reading some of this and I don't even know about it
        - let's try to keep an open mind and STUDENT I feel you like this science stuff right i'm
        - It won't be boring trust me it'd be super excited
        - What do you confused about
        - um you're right, I did say to expand on your answers um and you know I try to thing everyone's answer can be right, I mean um
        - and see how it kind of thinking more on that helped you figure that out
        - um so yeah i'm to so to bring us all to you and your your your responses were great and I love, how you STUDENT saw more about it and added an extra sentence to it
        - And it can help you learn it better, as well, so i'd like to thank you STUDENT for taking the time to answer the questions as well, oh
        - Does that make more sense of how what I wanted from you, STUDENT
        - Did you enjoy reading
        - And maybe we can learn from it
        - So maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on
        - So the more we learn the better off we might be
        - You know, I think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge, but nobody can know everything about one thing
        - And then you can raise your hands
        - But from this point on, I think I'm going to need to finish with telling you STUDENT what's going on
        - that's awesome that you know a lot about space, but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space I don't think, have you been
        - And i'm sure, one day, you will get there, but until then let's try to focus on learning a little bit more, so all right i'll repeat myself just so you STUDENT remember
        - Alright, so I believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry STUDENT, how can I help you
        - Okay, well, I appreciate your thoughts, but i'm just going to ask that we keep listening and that maybe we'll find new knowledge okay so
        - let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're STUDENT respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until I come to you Okay, unless you have a serious question
        - does that make sense
        - Well that's great that you have some background knowledge, we're just going to build that in this STUDENT and expand your knowledge on the subject
        - So to start off, we're gonna start with STUDENT
        - So all of you STUDENT read the text and gave good answers
        - I just want you to look closer at the text
        - And since we're in a small STUDENT we're supposed to discuss it here for next time
        - Okay, so to start off STUDENT had a great start answering the questions um
        - Well it's always great to expand your knowledge, because you can always learn something you wouldn't have thought you needed to know before so it's always a good experience to build upon our responses and our knowledge of the subject
        - As I was saying you guys all started off great and we're headed in the right direction and we only need to build your response, a little more to fully answer the question so to start with STUDENT
        - Most of you have an answer
        - So just basically look closer and it stated in the text, but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start
        - um well there's always room to grow for STUDENT when answering a question or doing an assignment, so, for your answer
        - Always you STUDENT want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though, if you agree, or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions
        - Exactly, these are STUDENT great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on
        - Do we remember reading that
        - STUDENT did a great job
        - Alright, so, um, we remember the other day, we read the text water on the moon
        - So the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses
        - Remember reading that and digesting the text? So in the text
        - So we remember we read the text water on the moon
        - Does that make sense
        - And I just want to like we want to meet in a STUDENT, just so we can work on our responses
        - So, um, you STUDENT gave responses
        - Does that make sense
        - Does that make sense?
        - That makes sense? Good
        - So I know where STUDENT is at learning
        - So I can help you STUDENT further if you need it
        - Does that make sense
        - It's for good participation and I want to make sure STUDENT says their answer
        - And even if you circle the last sentence, I still want you to say something
        - Good, awesome so we just read the passage that is called water is a valuable resource
        - And the five of you had answered the question that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - And i'm going to tell you exactly what I, what I want you to do, and I want you to apply that
        - You may understand it now, but I still want to tell you my concerns just so you and I are both on the same page
        - So STUDENT of us are going to keep learning
        - You're going to join us, I'm happy for you to join us today
        - Well, that's OK because we'll STUDENT learn-- all of us are learning anyway
        - So that's OK if you're in this STUDENT
        - So would you think that would be a form of equipment used by NASA?
        - hi STUDENT so today we're going to be looking at questions from our readings
        - STUDENT know what I'm talking about?
        - So that's okay, you're going to learn anyways, I appreciate you sharing that
        - Oh that's Okay, because we're still revising our answers, and I know you had an answer to the questions
        - Come back into STUDENT
        - Okay, so I want everyone to come back to STUDENT for a second
        - I noticed from your small groups that you STUDENT are talking about, you guys are looking
        - It's okay, you can be in our STUDENT
        - that's okay Luis because we're revising our answers and we're STUDENT learning today
        - So I appreciate you sharing that
        - Hey STUDENT, I'm so I just heard your great responses
        - So can we work together to do that
        - But we, there's a couple pieces were missing
        - I just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding
        - We have a great start
        - I saw that maybe we could STUDENT help each other, get a deeper understanding of space
        - Okay, well I pulled you aside because me as the teacher
        - Does that make sense
        - I didn't see you
        - Didn't I just want to make sure that we're on the same page
        - I see your hand
        - Again, just make sure you have STUDENT those pieces
        - Oh that's awesome we're going to really dive into this material and you're probably going to learn something you didn't already know you knew so we're going to still stay in this STUDENT and work together
        - you can look over what you have and then we're going to come back together and we're going to answer the question
        - If you STUDENT have any questions at any point, you can just raise your hand and I can answer
        - and then we're going to come back together and figure out a really strong answer as a STUDENT that answers the question completely sound good
        - Hi guys, so I liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text, but I brought us STUDENT together, just because some of us
        - So I think that we STUDENT have a reason to be here together
        - Well, we're STUDENT here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text
        - So, just listen to what I have to say, please
        - So this was an activity where I kind of wanted you STUDENT to discuss the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so does STUDENT have any confusion about what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - So we're talking about how we just read the moon, is a desert, and I know that, yes, STUDENT
        - we're going to learn, even more so i'm sure you're in the right place
        - You understand why it's a microscope
        - And that's why me and Jazmin just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure Jazmin understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so STUDENT Do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did
        - It's always fun to be with groups
        - Does that make sense
        - You might know a lot about space, but we're gonna go over what you STUDENT read in the text
        - So it might be something that new that you might not know
        - So have you STUDENT already read the text
        - So today we're going to be reviewing
        - The answers to everyone's discussion question
        - That we recently did over water on the moon
        - I don't think even science, STUDENT like scientists that have studied space for years know everything about space
        - that's interesting thing to say
        - I don't think even scientists like scientists that have been studying space their whole lives know STUDENT about space
        - Space is so big
        - um However, I think that some some mistakes that I saw across the board in some answers, or maybe not some mistakes, but just some places that STUDENT can work on um I believe
        - I think you STUDENT can come up with better
        - I noticed that
        - you STUDENT just finished reading water on the moon
        - And I also noticed that you STUDENT tended to have some answers that weren't thought about as best as I think you guys can think about
        - Better responses to the question that I'm asking because I know you STUDENT are super smart and you can do that
        - I just want to make sure that you understand STUDENT of what what we just talked about and stuff
        - And what we read
        - This is just to help you understand, just a little more
        - because I know you have really good words and you can use them and you're able to tell them I know you can tell me
        - So i've just been reading your responses and I wanted to pull you guys into a smaller group, because I feel like we can all do a little bit of improving on our responses and that's Okay, yes STUDENT excuse me
        - Oh, I know you do we STUDENT, definitely know all about space, and I know you all wrote some well all a lot of great answers, but we just want to take the time to make sure that your sentences are
        - So we want to dig a little bit deeper than that okay
        - We I know that you can dig a little deeper than that I know you're smarter than that, and I know that you have more complete sentences that you can give me
        - does that make sense yeah yeah
        - And they all had great information in them, I just pulled you aside, because I think we can each Dave a little deeper Okay, yes STUDENT excuse me
        - I know you guys STUDENT know all about space, but I just want to make sure that you're capturing the reading and the question clearly OK
        - OK now i'm going to go through each of you individually, but before I do that, I want you STUDENT to do something first okay
        - Can you STUDENT do that
        - All right, i'm going to count and then i'll let you STUDENT know and time's up okay
        - raise your hands when you're STUDENT done reading okay
        - STUDENT right, we're all done yeah alright perfect now i'm going to go through each of you, so that we can try and build your responses, a little better okay
        - I just want to make sure that you guys are getting it and I want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so STUDENT are you ready to take your time
        - Does STUDENT have the article water on the moon pulled up on their tablet
        - Do you see what I'm saying?
        - Do you STUDENT see that?
        - but I it just means that you need to look a little bit further into the reading yes
        - Does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense?
        - does that make sense
        - Does STUDENT else have any questions or confused about anything?
        - Does that make sense?
        - But I just wanted to go over these responses to see if we can get some really great answers
        - So I love that because we have a variation of answers
        - And so your responses were STUDENT a bit little bit different
        - You don't need to use what you said
        - Or you could use maybe something you found on your own
        - Alright STUDENT, so we just shared our great answers for the question but I just-
        - As we're going over our answers, I wanted to think back and let's really look at the question to see what the question was asking
        - And you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece
        - Alright STUDENT, so we just answered the second question, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and so you guys had some great answers
        - That supported the question and I do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good
        - and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you, yes or now
        - Does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense?
        - not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable
        - It only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great
        - Right, I understand, but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses
        - I'm sure you'll have some great contributions today
        - Well, you know what it's actually really important to foster collaboration and listen to our peers responses to help build on what you already know
        - You know what then we can actually just build on your background knowledge in your understanding that you already have, I think it's great that you already know a lot about space, but it's really important to build on that knowledge
        - do you STUDENT remember answering this question?
        - So STUDENT does that make sense to you too?
        - There's always room to learn more, even if we think we're the best at a subject
        - There's always something new we need to learn
        - A good attitude to keep is that never know
        - Too much there's always more that you can learn
        - Okay, so hearing your responses, I do want to do a little bit of work, you STUDENT had some awesome answers, but I want to make them even better
        - I loved your STUDENT responses looking at it
        - Well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it STUDENT, you always have an open mind to learn more
        - OK, raise your hand when you're finished
        - Does that make sense?
        - Yeah, so do you remember what I said to STUDENT?
        - OK, so now, hearing back from STUDENT of your responses and everything, they sound amazing, but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text
        - Yes, STUDENT, I believe
        - So right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the The story about not the story the reading about the moon
        - Good to see you too
        - Well, I'd love for you to stay and share some of your ideas with the other friends in our STUDENT, I think that would be
        - You know a lot about space
        - So let's see what we can come up with together
        - Do you want to go through it together
        - Does that make sense
        - Is that a little easier
        - does that make sense
        - does that make sense
        - That make more sense
        - Hi boys and girls
        - And you guys STUDENT had wonderful responses
        - So we just finished our small discussion about water on the moon
        - But now we're going to go a little bit deeper into the text and really think about
        - I think that we can always learn from each other
        - And so I think we can
        - Oh, okay, I understand
        - What you can do is look at the responses of your classmates and see if there's anything that you didn't know which would be really cool
        - Well, the good thing is, we can STUDENT learn some more from each other
        - and we can help each other by doing that, by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer
        - Is there anyone would want to add anything to our conversation? Yes STUDENT
        - Someone to explain a little bit more on what they were reading about or what they thought was interesting
        - I would just want some more expanding of your answers like STUDENT can expand on their answers, but if you don't have anything to say that's totally fine
        - hey STUDENT so listening to your answers lots of them were very great really proud of you guys, I just have a couple of questions
        - Does STUDENT else, want to add into it or thought that they saw something interesting in the reading yes
        - Okay, so great job explaining um that you guys think or did not think that water could be valuable on the moon for astronauts but I guess STUDENT okay
        - Okay, well, there are a couple of other students that I just want to ask a couple questions and maybe clarify and we can all talk about it, too, and go over the answers um so STUDENT
        - So this one's a little tricky I feel so
        - OK, that's great that you know a lot about space, but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about
        - Being in this STUDENT doesn't mean you don't know about it, it just means that I just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought
        - So I agree that you did it correct your answer and I think we're really on the right track, but what I want to talk about right now
        - So I know that we just read the article water on the moon
        - And you STUDENT were supposed to answer a question right
        - Do you see why it's a better answer
        - That is a way better answer
        - Okay STUDENT so now we're going to work on question number two
        - Well, I want us to work on how we answer the questions, not necessarily the information we already know about the water on the moon um but just how we answer the question okay
        - Do you see how there could be some confusion there
        - Yes, I see that you know a lot about space, but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon
        - STUDENT takes their own pace
        - Does STUDENT else have any questions about their responses?
        - Yeah, Chris or STUDENT
        - Do you have questions?
        - And STUDENT, do you have a question?
        - All right does STUDENT, excuse me does anyone else have any other questions
        - Does that makes sense
        - Oh okay well if that's the case and that's perfect and like I, so I would have the same note for STUDENT as well
        - Does that make sense to you
        - , alright sound like a good plan?
        - Okay well why don't you stick around for a few more minutes just we can hear because I want to talk about your answer after Jazmin's done
        - Does that make sense, do you have any questions
        - Okay, does that make more sense?
        - does that make sense
        - does STUDENT else have any other questions
        - So we just finished reading Our texts water on the moon
        - Well, there's always more that you can learn
        - And if you feel that you are an expert on the topic, you can always share with your classmates, so they know more or just as much as you do
        - Does that make sense,Luis?
        - Alright, so I was hearing some really great discussions on being said and I just want to focus on your responses individually
        - Everyone so after reading STUDENT your answers
        - It seems that there's a little bit of confusion
        - You STUDENT feel very strongly towards the question of whether they would be or there wouldn't be and it seems that there is a divide between the yes and the no
        - Does that make sense
        - Does my suggestion makes sense would that have helped you
        - give a different answer
        - Does that make sense
        - Well, we're just going to go through your guys' answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it
        - I think you STUDENT have a pretty good understanding, but I want to make sure you know fully what's going on
        - Does that make sense?
        - It's not always more, but I want you to be able to see where the evidence is coming from
        - Because then, I know that you know where the evidence is coming from
        - Reading the text is very important
        - So we're all in this STUDENT together, just because I wanted to pull you guys and make sure that we all understand together and work through our answers together in a group so even if
        - We believe that we're understanding everything I just want to make sure that is clarified among STUDENT okay
        - Alright, STUDENT, so we were working on our responses
        - Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding
        - All right does STUDENT have any questions about their responses and how they can help to make them better
        - that's a very interesting question does STUDENT else have any questions or comments related to the question about what we were reading
        - And I know we are gonna dive into what we read
        - Hello STUDENT, I know when we are working on
        - Our tasks in discussions with water on the moon
        - we're gonna we're going to really dig deep into more detail and get you will get a good understanding of the text
        - So I just want to make sure that everyone knows what they're reading and how we can really bring out the best in all of you STUDENT
        - Oh, STUDENT, you know plenty about space, but I just want to talk about what we learned in the text and what kind of interested us
        - Do you understand what I mean?
        - You STUDENT have any questions?
        - um Luis  I saw you guys seen this group, because I think that STUDENT your answers showed really good understanding of space, but I think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions
        - Alright STUDENT let's come back together now and let's share let's share the words that we chose in our groups
        - i'm Luis I think that you guys STUDENT have it figured out, but I think that if we just look at it a little more in depth, we could just get our answers to that much better
        - And we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look deeper into that STUDENT
        - but we are going to look a little bit deeper
        - STUDENT right, well let's try to listen and maybe help our friends along the way okay
        - Try to think about why we have to use
        - Do you see that
        - Does that make sense
        - What about making is that making more sense to you
        - So does STUDENT understand?
        - But there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more, OK?
        - STUDENT, you are very smart
        - STUDENT else have a question?
        - So we just read a little excerpt about the moon
        - Did you STUDENT enjoy water on the moon
        - Yes, water on the moon
        - Did you STUDENT enjoy the reading
        - And I want to just go over a couple of your answers
        - And that's why I pulled you
        - Okay, STUDENT else have any questions before we dive into our answers
        - We're just going to look deeper into them and kind of, you can explain your thinking to me
        - So then I can understand better and we can help each other, understand better so that sound good
        - Well, we're STUDENT going to just go over answers and see if there's anything to make them even better than they are now
        - Because you never know, you might even learn something new too
        - Okay, STUDENT else have any questions before we dive into our answers
        - So I want you to reread your answer that you gave And then raise your hand if you have any questions or if you think your answer is good or if you want to say something while your answer or ask why we're going to be really looking at your answer
        - So make sure it answers that question
        - But do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water
        - Do you see the difference between that in the microscope?
        - Is that making sense to you
        - STUDENT as well
        - Do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water
        - Maybe the article can teach you a couple things to that'd be pretty cool expand your knowledge
        - You're going to help us out
        - So cool, you know, lots of books space
        - Do you see how we could use that information
        - Did you STUDENT read the assignment that I send out to you about finding water on the moon
        - I'm glad you're STUDENT here
        - Alright, so I would like STUDENT five of you to take your papers out and have it in front of you, because we're going to be using highlighters and the pages
        - To find information within the text
        - Can you STUDENT do that
        - So we do we STUDENT agree that The main point of the first paragraph is that there's water in craters on the moon
        - I'm seeing some nods
        - STUDENT right, let's move on to the second paragraph
        - Give me a raised hand to show me that you are done, highlighting the main point in the second paragraph
        - Who's ready to move on to the third paragraph
        - So you STUDENT read a passage about discovering water on the moon
        - Is that correct,
        - Thank you for asking
        - We're going to come together
        - We're going to make a much better one
        - And together we're going to come up with a really good answer that uses STUDENT of your really great answers
        - Some targeted feedback to help you work on re answering this question,
        - And I'm going to give STUDENT of you
        - So I see Farrah, and STUDENT had the same answer
        - And you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us
        - There is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before
        - Try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well
        - So we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to STUDENT of you
        - And one thing that I want to tell all of you STUDENT about this question
        - so you STUDENT have some really great answers, but I want to dig into them a little further
        - Great, are there any other questions
        - Okay, so we've STUDENT had some responses and I want to talk about them a little bit more
        - and you've STUDENT had some really good answers, and I can see you're working really hard
        - STUDENT of you have done an excellent job and I know that you all are great thinkers, I think that we can work a little bit harder to make your answers the absolute best you can
        - Do you have a question
        - You do STUDENT You absolutely do
        - And your answer was so good that I think we can make it even better
        - Are you willing to be flexible and think with me
        - Does that make a little more sense
        - I'm sorry if that was a little confusing for you, but yes
        - So today, we can do something really fun in this small STUDENT, we're going to be reading detectives
        - Okay, so I need us STUDENT
        - Nice to see you too
        - Cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers
        - Okay STUDENT Do you have a question
        - So today we're going to be reading detectives
        - You can, is that okay
        - connecting the information in your brain is also going to help you a lot, but I just want to make sure that you're getting the best answer
        - Were you listening when I was talking to STUDENT early earlier
        - I mean that is going to really be helpful
        - And then we have this stuff on the text
        - Right we have this knowledge in our brain
        - Are you ready to be a reading detective
        - And you know what that might add to that information that's in your brain, you might learn something new
        - So can anybody tell me what you STUDENT were just reading about
        - Can STUDENT tell me what this article was about
        - Tell me what was this article about
        - Does STUDENT else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article
        - Does STUDENT else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left
        - And there's always more room for us to learn more about space which is exactly why we're here today
        - I've been reading over your answers and I wanted us to take a second look at this text to see if there's any to see if we can make our responses
        - STUDENT I'm sure you do
        - Raise your hand if you have questions about what you're supposed to do right now
        - I don't see STUDENT raising their hand
        - This means that we understand what we need to do
        - Welcome to reading task water on the moon
        - Have you read it?
        - Did you have the chance
        - Hello, boys and girls I'm, what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy together, then you are going to practice it, and in a small STUDENT and I will come to talk to you a little more individually later if you still have some progress
        - Nod your head to let me know
        - If you understand what I'm saying, please
        - Great so do you Notice what STUDENT said?
        - Yes, so the machine is the Lunar Orbiter, do you agree?
        - And if you understand what I'm saying please know that your head to let me know
        - We're gonna talk more about space today
        - My name is Miss Teacher and I'm going to be working with you
        - Teacher : That's okay, STUDENT
        - Teacher : Does that make sense
        - That you know so much about space, but we're going to expand our knowledge today as a STUDENT
        - Are we STUDENT set, or do we need more time
        - So you have some background knowledge
        - So let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment
        - Can you summarize what STUDENT just said for me?
        - My name is Teacher, so we're going to be digging a little bit deeper into our discussion questions on reading about water on the moon
        - No matter what the subject and even if you know STUDENT about space right now
        - Oh yeah, I believe it, but there's always more to learn
        - So I like a lot of these answers, but why don't we, I think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers
        - My name is Teacher, and today I'm going to be helping you with our comprehension questions from the text that we read about the moon
        - Just a little bit
        - So we're STUDENT here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually, but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers
        - Do you have a question
        - We're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon
        - Does that make a little more sense
        - Does STUDENT else have any other questions to clarify this response
        - So you STUDENT read water on the moon
        - This particular text okay by this author
        - I just want to make sure that STUDENT understands this text
        - Oh, that's wonderful to have your background knowledge
        - It shouldn't take too long
        - If there's just a double, double check that you understand what I want you to understand
        - I just wanted to take some time today to reflect and make sure
        - So yes, we STUDENT revise and corrected our answers
        - That it's really our learning is really set in stone
        - Okay, so, um,
        - We are going to take a few minutes to reflect on our takeaways from our revised answers
        - We STUDENT corrected our answers and be revised it and I just want to make sure that
        - I just want to hear your takeaways and reflections
        - Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - Alright, let's just let's use the same approach we used for STUDENT, and then answer
        - Why should we look for you worked with Jazmin and STUDENT right?
        - So today in our small STUDENT, we are going to be discussing our reading that we did have about water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT want to add to that anything that they heard while I was reading
        - Does anyone else have anything they want to add to this discussion, STUDENT
        - What do you want to add
        - I'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you STUDENT today
        - Wow, I'm sure you know, tons about space, but we're always open to learning more and more so
        - Alright so what we're going to talk about now
        - Did you STUDENT get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon
        - Do you understand why I had you do this
        - Does that make sense
        - Okay, well, we're just going to talk a little bit more
        - Yeah, I do too
        - That's our we're gonna STUDENT talk a little bit more about this so that we can keep learning
        - Does that make sense
        - Is that makes sense
        - Does STUDENT understand these instructions
        - Okay, so let's continue reading through and seeing what else we found that we can add to our answers
        - I'm gonna keep talking to STUDENT
        - So continue from where we left off
        - You were looking at Chris's answer
        - I think the last one
        - So you were looking at Luis's answer right
        - I'm going to go back over to Oliver and savannas STUDENT
        - So keep working
        - How did we enjoy that text, the water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT want to share anything important that they read
        - I'm glad you liked it
        - STUDENT You said you know a lot about space, you want to share anything else
        - So I like that we were thinking, did STUDENT else want to add something?
        - Okay, so today we are talking about our article that we read about water on the moon
        - And I see that you've STUDENT answered your questions here
        - I want to go over a couple of things
        - So did we just read an article
        - Okay, friends, usually in my classes when students agree we go like this, but if you agree
        - You can raise your hand if you disagree with savannas thoughts and just keep your hand down and we respectfully agree and respectfully disagree
        - I love space to I want us to put on our science minds and only think about the article that we read
        - So in the article that we read a read it out loud for us
        - And I'm so excited that I got to hear STUDENT of your answers because together we can explore more about the moon and more about scientific tools and what scientists have used for their equipments to discover some moon aspects and I hear every student has a different answer
        - That's so important because what does that tell me
        - Thank you for sharing
        - So here, nobody is wrong or nobody is right, we're STUDENT going to learn together and we're going to explore
        - Why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries
        - You're going to listen and fully listen to your partner
        - The second task you have two minutes
        - For number one the first task you have two minutes and for number two
        - Let me know if you have any questions
        - Did you go back to your texts and reread paragraphs one and two?
        - Okay, so we're going to continue right where we left off, STUDENT
        - Okay, are you ready to share what you got what the new partner
        - Are there any questions
        - Are you able to add to your Answer
        - Then I'm going to work with you
        - Thank you for asking
        - We STUDENT have different ideas and together we can put our ideas and put our ideas together and have a whole list of tools that help scientists discover the water on the moon
        - Right, and no student is wrong
        - Good to see you too
        - I think that we should talk about our answers and relating to the text that we just read because I'm on getting the idea that you  May not have completely understood the equipment that was used to find that water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT understand that
        - Can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense
        - Does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked
        - Does STUDENT else have any more questions
        - Or need more clarification
        - I'm Teacher and I'm going to go over this question based on the text that we read
        - It's good to see you, too
        - When you know you can raise your hand and I will call on you
        - So I'm going to give you a minute to go back
        - And look for that word and see if it changes your answer in any way
        - So I'm going to give you a minute to go back and read
        - Ready when you have a new idea
        - You can raise your hand
        - So let's do that for another minute
        - When you're ready, you can raise your hand
        - The text will give us so many different examples
        - Ways that it can be valuable
        - If we look back in the text
        - So I hope that we can modify
        - I hope that we can change our answers
        - After reading the text because now we have sources of evidence
        - And can we find one more example because I want us to be prepared to re answer this question and in complete sentences, to the best of our ability and finishing our thoughts
        - It's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this STUDENT because we can have a better understanding
        - So right if you know things about space, but there's always more that we can learn
        - Do you understand what I'm saying
        - So today I would like to go over some of the questions
        - Two questions that you STUDENT have answered
        - It's just sometimes we can learn more when we work together
        - This STUDENT wasn't formed because you don't know about space
        - In small groups are like first of STUDENT to work together so we can learn from each other and work on bettering our responses to certain questions
        - STUDENT right now we're answering the question
        - Maybe they'll have extra time to talk about stuff that relates to a question
        - Oh, that's pretty nice
        - Okay, so once we answer the question and finish what we're doing here
        - For our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon
        - Oh well, let's let's talk about your answer because maybe if your answer so great, if we can probably help some of the others who are here
        - let's get back to the tax, have you found the correct answer STUDENT
        - So, have you found your answer
        - So today we're going to be talking about water on the moon
        - That is called the moon is a desert, right?
        - And we have a reading that I, I understand that you read it already
        - The moon is a desert
        - Okay, so let's just start
        - So raise your hand if you are ready, read the lecture there
        - That is cool
        - After reading these these lecture, I want you to
        - Okay, so tell me about it
        - Okay, so you are ready, you have the knowledge of ready
        - I want to know
        - So remember, um, I want to listen to STUDENT of your thoughts
        - So because of your, of your opinions are important in their contribution good information for this STUDENT
        - Um, because I really think that STUDENT your thoughts are important
        - So I want to hear STUDENT of your ideas
        - Nice to meet you too
        - I understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon
        - Am I correct you read it already
        - But I think that STUDENT the time
        - We can learn something new
        - So maybe you can learn something here and maybe we can help you to improve your knowledge or maybe you can help us to enter or knowledge or knowledge
        - Okay, so in the beginning, I just wanted to know if you have the main ideas, clear and then we can talk more about it
        - Okay, so we will also talk about it later
        - OK, so the you read the water on the moon text already, raise your hand if you read it
        - I'm going to be your teacher today
        - I'm going to work with you in two different groups Farrah and STUDENT
        - I'm going to start with you first
        - I know that you know a lot about space and I'm happy that you can bring that knowledge with you
        - I just wanted to work with the three of you to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into this question
        - I wanted to work with you three to look a little bit further into the question
        - Thank you for joining our group today I wanted to start off by reading the question to STUDENT and then thinking about what the most important part of the question is
        - So we were we were investigating the water on the moon text
        - First, I want to ask you STUDENT
        - Did you guys enjoy this test, did you learn anything from it, STUDENT
        - How'd you like it
        - The short text, did you STUDENT learn anything
        - Let me ask you again, actually, who did you STUDENT enjoy this
        - STUDENT want to share
        - See some head nods
        - STUDENT else take anything from the text that was the main idea, but anything anyone else notice anything or think anything was cool
        - I just want to come together and see if someone can give me A refined answer from what the what everything we just talked about, like, another answer maybe building on the original answer that you had to the question
        - I just want to, uh, before I wrap it up
        - Does STUDENT remember what we were working on before
        - Jump back into the text into what we were doing before
        - When I got STUDENT your answers back to the prompt, there was a couple of things I wanted to go back over just to make sure that we're all on the same page
        - So you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too
        - I appreciate that
        - And that we STUDENT can come to a solid answer for the prompt
        - So I'm glad that you're the expert
        - But I'm glad you're here today
        - And we've been reading some exciting news about water being discovered on the moon, of STUDENT places, right
        - And I know some of you are totally see it as
        - Hang on one second
        - I know some of you were really interested in that and had the same question I did like how did the scientists so far away, find water
        - Oh no, it's great
        - So that's why we're here thinking about when we're reading by ourselves
        - To find out more information about our answers
        - We're going to get together and think about how we can read even further
        - There's there's tools we can use to find out even more when we're interested in, in an answer
        - So that's what we're here today and it's good that there's a small STUDENT
        - Have you done close reading before
        - Is we can help each other and you can help me to kind of dig down into our article that's called close reading
        - So believe it or not, we can do close reading in Science right and social studies to find out, we're looking for
        - We're STUDENT here today to help each other and we need to have some materials ready
        - So I wanted to ask you
        - So to start, I'm so glad you're here today
        - Do you STUDENT have your article and some cut something to market mark on it with
        - This is early in the morning and
        - Put your hand up if you have it in front of you just do a check to make sure you have your article and a pencil or pen or something to mark up to put your hand up if you have that
        - OK, I see four hands
        - And let's make sure before we continue doing any reading
        - You can put your hands down
        - Let's make sure we're clear about what we're looking for
        - I'm so impressed STUDENT set to go
        - So one tool to help us is to make sure we look at the question really carefully that's going to give us some clues or some science to what look for
        - Do you remember that question from yesterday
        - Okay, I want you STUDENT to look at your at your you Oh, do you have that question in front of you
        - So you hit you see it STUDENT
        - Is it on your paper
        - Put your hands up and just show me that you can STUDENT see the question at the top of your paper
        - Okay, so, and here I put it
        - Here's my first job for you
        - Okay, you can put your hands down
        - Okay, so, Farrah and STUDENT
        - I'm going to start with you STUDENT
        - Alright, are we ready to go around and discuss a little bit more about what we read
        - Okay, so what we're, we will take a little bit more time and dig into that in a bit
        - Oh well, you know the great thing about being in groups is that you might know a lot about space somebody else might
        - And whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you
        - Well, you are right, but I also just want you to be able to you know, see the bigger picture and kind of say that was one part of the equipment, but
        - Does that make sense
        - Oh well, you know that's the great part about being in a group, we STUDENT have different strengths, we bring to it, so you may know a lot about space, but you know I think there's always something you can learn
        - Does that make sense
        - Does that kind of make more sense about where you're kind of going and what we're looking for with the question?
        - Does that make sense?
        - So even if you know all about space right I think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this STUDENT today does that sound okay
        - does that sound right
        - yeah I think so, what do you think
        - That feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you
        - equipment is the answer to the question does that sound good
        - so maybe you STUDENT can take a look at that does that sound good
        - Okay Luis well, I think that we are STUDENT here to learn from each other we're all here to learn from the article
        - You STUDENT read the the article about water on the moon, is that correct?
        - so make sense STUDENT?
        - But part of why we're here really yeah thanks is is honestly to understand you know one another's perspectives and maybe there's something that say Chris can share, about space that you know that I don't know or that STUDENT doesn't know and vice versa,
        - So I think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that STUDENT
        - yeah totally so let's let's dig into that now
        - i'm so pleased to work with you today, I always learned so much from each of you, so I wanted to let you know, so why we're here so based on the responses and I i've identified some areas that I think that we can revisit The text together to just really strengthen our understanding
        - As I mentioned, I learned from you guys every day so we're here to work together to just deepen STUDENT of our understandings on the text
        - And, based on the responses that each of you provided, I do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon, and about water on the moon that sound okay
        - That is precisely it you know what it's extra difficult when something is unfamiliar to us and
        - but for a lot of us and spaces just totally for, and I mean let's be honest, none of us have been there before right
        - I brought you here because I would love to discuss with you, your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - So I wanted to let you know that I brought you into the STUDENT because there's always opportunity for us to grow our understandings of a topic, even if we know a lot about them
        - does STUDENT understand that
        - To really comprehend what's going on there,
        - So Please go back and read it again and then find out something you may find something new
        - So you STUDENT just got done with reading the moon, is a desert
        - So we just read the water on the moon passage in STUDENT right?
        - but we are talking about the moon specifically today and I just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we STUDENT understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good
        - yeah awesome Thank you so much, and we know that the moon is kind of one big rock so it seems like there's a lot of geology that's going to happen going on in the moon, huh?
        - Yes, and that's how they found the water on there right
        - do you guys have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by Farrah and STUDENT that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before?
        - awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is Teacher you can call me Teacher if you'd like um and I wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you guys read yes STUDENT
        - Do you understand the difference
        - does that make sense to STUDENT
        - so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the Lunar orbiter
        - Oliver or STUDENT, I know you also had had your hands up was there, something that you either one of you wanted to share
        - i'm really excited to meet you STUDENT too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher, so I thought this was super cool did you guys read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage
        - yeah I think so too i'm really excited to get to talk to you STUDENT about this text today because i'm a science teacher, so I thought this article was really, really interesting so let's dig in a little bit to our question today
        - hang on Chris i'm going to give you guys all second to go back and revise then I want to hear from STUDENT and to else haven't I heard from yet, I think
        - i'll give you guys STUDENT a second
        - STUDENT have I heard from you?
        - STUDENT can I pause you for one second
        - we're going to hear what Farrahs was thinking and then we're STUDENT going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay
        - Excellent they use the Lunar orbiter to discover it
        - Oliver, you said the same exact thing as STUDENT
        - Does that make a little more sense to you?
        - Does that makes sense STUDENT?
        - Well, that I mean we STUDENT have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about, but I just want to make 100% I just want to be 100% clear that we all have gotten it and understood it
        - Well we're just going over our journal answers to talk and discuss in maybe learn more from our friends who are in our STUDENT with us
        - okay any questions before I say go
        - That you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense
        - does that make sense
        - hi it's nice to see you STUDENT again and I am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon
        - does STUDENT have any questions
        - Is anybody else confused um I don't know if you guys can do, and I agree sign, but we that's that's what I do in real life so i'm STUDENT
        - So while we're using space as a context for this actually our classes more about learning how to extract information from readings so it's more of a reading exercise, rather than a space exercise
        - And while you reread that Luis out i'll move on to STUDENT
        - Does that make sense to STUDENT
        - Oh that's great and what did you think of it, oh yes STUDENT
        - Okay, so who can tell me what the article is about
        - What else do you remember from the article
        - Okay does STUDENT else have any questions before we get started
        - You think you could do that?
        - Well you don't need to necessarily have background knowledge about space, so you read the article
        - Hi class, so I just got through looking over your responses and I just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so STUDENT look at yours again
        - Thank you STUDENT for sharing
        - Why don't we start with Oliver and STUDENT
        - Do you have a question for me?
        - Alright, so I heard some great ideas from the STUDENT
        - So I saw some - actually before we get there, STUDENT you have a hand up
        - So right now, if STUDENT has their texts in front of them
        - Can I get a thumbs up or a yes, if you have your text still in front of you?
        - So now we have microscope and lunar orbiter
        - Thank you Luis and we got that straight from the text where STUDENT just read, for us
        - Jazmin was really nice and that she respectfully disagree disagree dwith Farrah and STUDENT
        - Anyone disagree or want to push back on that? Or we STUDENT agree that these two words can be used as synonyms?
        - So does anyone have questions or want to disagree with that statement? STUDENT, you have a hand up what are you thinking?
        - So it's really nice to have you all in a small STUDENT together, I know you just read your passage on water on the moon
        - oh yes STUDENT
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does that help clarify?
        - hi Farrah and Jen and STUDENT and Jazmin he said i'm excited to talk to you today, we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so Chris Oh yes, even What would you like to say
        - Here, because sometimes other people know more about other things than us, we want to make sure that we STUDENT hear each other out there Jazmin had a great answer and you just expanded on it, so we all get to work together here, which is awesome
        - Alright, students, so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon, and I think we need to- yes STUDENT
        - If you think it's the Lunar orbiter raise your hand
        - if you think it is the microscope raise your hand
        - OK, I see two hands two hands awesome okay you can put your hands down
        - love the um does anyone else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for Jazmin house and the STUDENT are you good
        - um so did STUDENT if you read the other three passages, but for the moon, is a desert
        - Very good amazing OK, so now that we have a fair idea of what equipment means let's try to read let's try to figure out the answer this question in context um so before that that me
        - Beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well
        - And I love to hear from two other scholars and you, you can also comment on it, and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um
        - um why don't you um let's just hang tight for a minute okay
        - Great Okay, so you STUDENT just read a very short article
        - yeah because you STUDENT were right on the right track, we just had to make that one little jump
        - You STUDENT did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming
        - So before we start can we, oh STUDENT, did you have a question
        - hi everyone i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small STUDENT, so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon
        - Great i'm really glad to hear that so we're going to talk a little bit more about this and ways that we can go even deeper into our text
        - In a group of small, a smaller group, instead of our whole entire STUDENT as one
        - we are going to try to go a little bit deeper into our text today
        - You can shake your head, yes or no, if you can
        - But but let's go back to talking about the Lunar orbiter because I just thought that was so interesting
        - Is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and I wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates
        - And we're going to continue yeah definitely I really like it we're going to continue talking about legos as a way to help us understand what we're talking about in this article so STUDENT what's the difference i'm sorry did somebody say something
        - Does that make sense?
        - Does that make sense
        - So today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about NASA
        - Well i'm glad that you're really interested in space, and I think that being a part of this STUDENT you'll learn from your
        - STUDENT why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say, and maybe we can learn some new things
        - does that make sense
        - i'm here to give you the feedback that, for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin, are you STUDENT ready to begin?
        - Oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is Teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback
        - Does that make sense
        - Well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and I noticed some very interesting patterns, so the aim of our discussion today is to Oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah STUDENT you have a question
        - stick with us and let's see what we can learn from each other as well
        - So, are you guys ready to share back with the STUDENT
        - STUDENT, so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you
        - So, at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail, yes STUDENT
        - because we are right now looking for a very specific equipment in response to a question
        - So do you think STUDENT of you have a clear answer now, do you think our response has evolved to we can Can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement
        - Alright, so can we look at some of the questions that you answered about what you've read about the moon?
        - STUDENT do you understand
        - Great, thank you for reading for us
        - do you have more, a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now?
        - You got it now, STUDENT?
        - um you know today we're just going to have a little conversation and yeah i'd love for you to bring in STUDENT that outside knowledge, because
        - what do you think
        - awesome it's great to see you STUDENT, so you guys just read that article write about water on the moon
        - And Farrah the reasons why we wanted to in this STUDENT, so that you can bring your expertise to talk about that microscope for us okay
        - So we thank you, we appreciate you for that STUDENT else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us
        - how do you feel about that
        - Some responses on your questions and I wanted to work with you guys, to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes STUDENT
        - yeah so Oliver it's so important in this space for us to know that STUDENT is doing their own thinking, and I know that you have such a valuable thinking to offer in this space
        - Great and there's a second part to that question that says circle, do you see that part
        - yeah great question and Oliver, I really want you to pay close attention to what's STUDENT and I are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as Farrah okay
        - I actually chose STUDENT of you, because I think all of your insights are very valuable and I really want to hear a lot more about what you're thinking
        - STUDENT right, thank you so much, so what I wanted I want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering
        - STUDENT right, what do we think do we think that investigating is a similar kind of thing to discovering
        - that's really fascinating and makes me think that maybe sometime later, we should have a discussion about
        - i'm your teacher and i'm excited to talk to you today meet for a little bit to discuss what we all just read from water on the moon, which is pretty exciting hi yes STUDENT you have a question
        - Oh well, that's really that's helpful, but the reason we're in this STUDENT is, I wanted to explore a little more deeply i'm really interested in what you understand about this article overall right and how how the whole process works
        - What they use to look at it was microscopic does that makes sense
        - does that make sense
        - Does that make sense
        - Does that make sense STUDENT yeah yeah
        - Yeah, STUDENT, I see you raise your hand, what can I help you with Luis?
        - Good morning everybody- I guess it's afternoon now! so you've STUDENT just shared your answers with me and they were awesome answers
        - I think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today
        - awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does STUDENT have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct
        - does that make sense
        - does that make sense
        - and revise our responses
        - Does that make sense
        - Alright, everyone, so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question, right now, so I want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question, to see if we can all come to an understanding yes STUDENT
        - Alright, everyone so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses, because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know, the more everyone seems to have a different response yeah STUDENT have a question
        - Alright, so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and I want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so STUDENT has really good specific details and different questions yeah even
        - But I want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole STUDENT, and then I want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole group applies to your question does that sound good
        - amen so look at your response and then think about like does your the response that you wrote answer both of those two things
        - You on musk such a card all right let's come back to this question up front right so STUDENT sort of has different answers
        - And STUDENT has really good parts of answers and some parts that we can work on, so I want to give you a strategy that I think would be really helpful for us to like make our responses more concise and find out what we're looking for
        - So, now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am
        - maybe even could could we get started looking at your your answer and maybe we can work together to try to see if that worked with the text and we can STUDENT learn from each other how's that sound
        - So okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text
        - Sound good STUDENT
        - So um did you STUDENT read the text about water on the moon?
        - So today what we will do is to probe into this comprehension question and to have a classroom discussion
        - So what we are going to do first is to work, individually and then we will go into free discussion and some elbow exchange
        - so could STUDENT like to have a dialogue about that
        - But we are just going back over this question, we want to get as much out of this text as possible, even if you already know STUDENT about space
        - they're still lots that we can learn from this passage, I promise, so if we could STUDENT just look
        - that's a really good point anything I think that's a great explanation does that make sense
        - So STUDENT are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better
        - Well, we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a STUDENT, come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay
        - My name is Teacher and i'm excited to be here
        - So we're talking about this article about water on the moon right?
        - hi STUDENT i'm so excited to meet you
        - Oh yeah that's great um so Luis i'm glad you're here because we're gonna be talking a lot about space, this is not a STUDENT for people that don't know about space, this is a group for people that are excited to learn more about space
        - hi STUDENT okay so we're going to keep talking about equipment
        - Oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two
        - um but after after hearing them, I think that some might be too specific and some may be too general, I think that you're STUDENT just slightly off
        - um and I think STUDENT although your response was very interesting, I think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay
        - So I think that um do you guys want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses STUDENT that yeah def
        - deb Thank you so much for that response you guys did a wonderful job today Thank you STUDENT so much
        - I love that you STUDENT Thank you so much, and if, when you come back next time, try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience
        - awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs
        - um do you STUDENT have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon
        - that's awesome well I bet there are a few things that you don't know so i'm excited as you grow your learning today
        - On not yet I think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what STUDENT had for his answer
        - hi alright, so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article, we read about NASA would anyone like yeah STUDENT
        - hey also Farrah Chris and Luis have shared some revised responses and will we kind of need to go through them a little bit just as a STUDENT, to see where we're at
        - Does that make sense
        - Well we're still going to go through the rest of STUDENT else's So if you could help us like us, are thinking and pay attention to the other folks is they waited for you, that would be really great
        - So you might also help us be able to think a little bit deeper
        - That feels like a really thorough answer to me, does it feel like a thorough answer to you
        - So we have the Lunar orbiter in there, which is specificity right Luis right STUDENT we were talking about specificity earlier great
        - Okay Thank you STUDENT for sharing i'm going to ask you to think a little about your answers and i'm going to ask for a little more detail from each of you
        - STUDENT of it, I think we can always learn more
        - Okay well we'll start with STUDENT and then we'll come to you how does that sound
        - Quick does STUDENT know what a crater is
        - we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part
        - The great thing about reading is that you can always ask more questions and deeper questions
        - I think we can push it a little more
        - Did anyone else have anything that they found very interesting? STUDENT
        - and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you, how does that sound
        - Alright, so hi STUDENT, so I pulled the five of you aside just because I wanted to take a closer look at our answers to the first question for this reading
        - Alright, did STUDENT have enough time?
        - we're gonna figure it out together
        - yeah so let's let's keep talking about it so
        - hi everyone thanks for joining me here today, so we just read a short passage about water on the moon, and I got to read STUDENT of your responses and I just wanted to see if we could
        - How does that sound
        - Okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that I can assist you with
        - Okay sounds good, well, maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound Okay, so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right
        - i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why I felt like we should all be talking together in a small STUDENT to learn from each other, does that sound okay
        - After that we are going to give each of you some time, maybe two or three minutes to revise your response, and then we will share with our small STUDENT does that sound like a good plan
        - Can I get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay
        - okay does that sound good
        - that sound good i'll give you about a few minutes to do that, while I go talk to another okay
        - And after you have shared your answer with me, I am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right, and I want you to think about their thinking, as well as you're thinking yes STUDENT
        - Well, we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so, even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us, and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right STUDENT
        - Okay, so, while you work on that i'm going to go ahead and move to our other friends does that sound good STUDENT or do you have any questions
        - Does that make sense
        - that's funny I have heard about that I heard about that, on the news so that's great that you know something about Pluto I think today we'll talk a little bit about water on the moon, because that's what we read about in our article
        - Okay um so yeah I think the one thing I noticed when I was looking at our answers to today's questions is that I think we've got a little bit of room to expand our understanding of the text
        - So I think if we chat together and put some of these pieces together we're STUDENT going to end up with really improved answers, so I think for this first question
        - So maybe if we kind of glue STUDENT of this, together, we can come up with a clear answer so, can you raise your hand if you said no, that the water on the moon is not valuable
        - because I was wondering if we could raise our hand if we said that no the water was not valuable
        - does that make sense STUDENT
        - And so, in our first question we were talking about different types of equipment scientists use you STUDENT seem to know a little bit about that now
        - And now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water, might it be valuable for our future scientists, STUDENT go ahead yeah
        - Okay, so STUDENT had such great ideas and responses to the question and I loved hearing everybody's
        - Now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a group discussion of your responses to see whether or not you guys can figure out like which yeah, of course, STUDENT
        - You STUDENT have any more questions
        - Well, that makes the response more complete, I guess, in a way
        - You you, you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that
        - hi Farrah high Oliver hi Chris hi Jazmin hi Luis So do you STUDENT want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question
        - do you understand what i'm saying
        - does that answer questions the one
        - and STUDENT that I believe that kind of answers your question right
        - is that STUDENT right
        - hi class so i'm Mr Z and you guys are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and STUDENT here to answer any questions, yes
        - can you do that for me STUDENT
        - And I loved your responses and I just want to know a little bit more about it because i'm looking at the text and i'm a little confused too
        - STUDENT right, so I think you all you all just shared your responses and you all have sparked some thoughts
        - okay? um so i've heard, so I'm going to review your responses out loud
        - This is what I've heard
        - Just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking
        - Oh okay wait so sorry, you said you shouldn't be in this group, because you know STUDENT about space?
        - Have you STUDENT read the test, I did you
        - Well, so do own to talk about the question
        - You were a lot about space right
        - Help us to understand this test, so we are going to get an answer, based on this test
        - but let's focus on this test
        - To help us understand the context of the question, so now i'm going to read the question again and then we're going to keep what Farrah and STUDENT gave us um for us to understand the context of equipment
        - So I put us to sit in this small STUDENT, because I really liked you guys's answer, but I wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers
        - I know, but we're just talking about it,
        - Cuz you answered it
        - Exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer
        - Okay does STUDENT else have any questions
        - Okay, so we're going to go through and i'm going to ask you STUDENT a little bit more about what you said, for your answers so once again, the question is
        - So, not a problem um does STUDENT have any other questions about it
        - Great so I know you STUDENT had a good mix of answers which is really good because it actually helps us get down to the root of
        - The actual answer that we're looking for right
        - STUDENT right, let's come back in 321
        - Alright, so before we go back to her desk and just a moment let's make sure that we all come to agreement on a on a STUDENT answer okay
        - we want to make sure that you can combine the park, so you guys can STUDENT get the full answer does that make sense
        - So I know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right
        - oh how's that sound?
        - We've STUDENT read the article
        - Are we good to start
        - sure when and remember this is not really a STUDENT for who knows about space and who doesn't this is more just, have we written an answer that completely answers this question
        - So, again it's not that your answers necessarily right or wrong there's always a way to make something better though right so let's take a look actually your is end of
        - does that make sense
        - who thinks that this is answering the question being asked raise your hand
        - so i'm curious to hear some of the ideas that we've come up with to help explain why water might be valuable there on the moon
        - does that sound good
        - does that makes sense
        - Any other questions as we're updating our answers
        - Great fantastic so you just read water on the moon
        - Right fantastic Okay, so you read the article water on the moon
        - You circled evidence in the text, you can use to answer the question
        - Can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence
        - So Oliver and STUDENT i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first
- intent: r130.1
  examples: |
        - that's that's totally correct I think we'd STUDENT agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope And that microscope was used so actually sorry um
        - So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things
        - Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        - But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon
        - You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - It is semi right
        - And that is very close and
        - But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage
        - However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits
        - Then once they figured out that there was
        - Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there
        - That there was water on the moon
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope
        - It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment
        - And STUDENT you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - But we're going to look for one more thing
        - Could you tell me what word another word that you circled
        - Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word
        - Other key word in the question so STUDENT
        - And that's absolutely something that was in that reading
        - That is absolutely true
        - STUDENT scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here
        - One is kind of a version of the other slits
        - Think about it
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct
        - Yeah, and that's right, they do use that
        - So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon
        - If it were astronauts on the moon
        - The astronauts use STUDENT that you are correct in that,
        - So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in
        - So, that is correct
        - STUDENT, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again
        - Okay, I read STUDENT of your answers and I think that you have very good points
        - They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question
        - And that was right too
        - But that was not enough for that question
        - STUDENT says that NASA sent a small machine
        - Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but
        - So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response
        - Um, I think that we can do even better
        - You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me
        - Luis So what we can do is you can kind of learn from STUDENT here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you
        - We're almost exactly where we want to be
        - That was really, really good
        - But we're so close now
        - We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there
        - So thank you for your
        - That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope
        - And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question
        - So let's look at your answer
        - Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do
        - That's very knowledgeable of you point that out
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a STUDENT that's awesome dead
        - And we're going to dig deeper
        - Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer
        - You are right, they, they set that small machine
        - And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        - Okay, Farrah and STUDENT, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely
        - Well, yeah, that's what they STUDENT have to use just to be there
        - That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?
        - and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more
        - So if we put Jazmin's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer
        - Okay, so that's that's part of an up
        - The answer is that we could have more space having more room
        - And let's see
        - So that's a good start on your answer
        - STUDENT had a good start on his too
        - Well, it's not completely wrong
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close
        - Um, so yeah, good job
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope
        - So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer
        - That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing
        - Because yes, they would use STUDENT of that  but
        - You just need to elaborate a little bit more
        - No, it's not wrong
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon
        - That NASA sent a small machine
        - Does that make sense?
        - It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space
        - I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction
        - So I want STUDENT to look at the text
        - So you've got part of the answer, right?
        - In the polar craters
        - You've got a piece of it
        - Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was
        - They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it
        - But what you have is a great start
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now
        - And that is correct
        - So you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,
        - They do need that
        - So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe
        - Okay, so they did find
        - Craters water on the moon,
        - You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong
        - And STUDENT, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water
        - Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer
        - And because STUDENT just responded with, he thinks he knows just about everything about this
        - And so, Hey STUDENT I did want to tell you that I really enjoyed reading your answer because you talked about the way water is split and you said to split into two parts, hydrogen, oxygen, that is correct
        - So the scientists would have to use an oxygen tank to breathe up in space
        - Okay, yeah, you're right
        - And your response to just didn't specifically, answer the question
        - Yeah, maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question, but you were correct
        - And those astronauts didn't have to oxygen, oxygen tanks like STUDENT said
        - So looking at your responses
        - I will say this, STUDENT
        - You were probably the closest and getting the correct answer with your response
        - STUDENT, you put sounds is filming craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, they did find craters with water
        - All right, now STUDENT, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right
        - So maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it
        - Because if you look, if we listen and look at all of your answers STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - But they did find water in some of those places
        - That's not entirely true
        - We're so we use microscopes to discover things just like you STUDENT said it is a tool that we can use to help us to discover things
        - What tool they this, the scientists used so you can use a microscope
        - So I think both of you were, you were right in the fact that they do use the scientific tool, but we just need to clarify what that tool
        - So great job
        - So you were right in that it was a small machine
        - So it's the moon isn't ready for us to live on yet
        - So you're absolutely right
        - Those are STUDENT tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon
        - There's definitely no oxygen in space,
        - And that would be that would be correct
        - It's part of the answer
        - Okay, well let's um so you're you were able to find out that there was that they used a small machine
        - That is, you know, very good job, you were able to discover sort of what the answer was
        - And STUDENT, you are you are you know you were correct to you, you're able to find out where they were able to find the water
        - Well, they would definitely use that equipment, especially to You know, breathe and sort of operate within the space around the moon and on the moon
        - So, good job
        - I'm not totally sure we could have, like, maybe the entire moon being covered by garden
        - Did you look at discover
        - It's not that it was the wrong answer
        - It could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question
        - They're using a microscope to see the water
        - So you both are on the right track here in the equipment
        - You might have made an observation about the scientists finding craters, which is very good that you're noticing the craters, and that's where the water is
        - So you you are partially correct so you're right in the sense that NASA did send a small machine
        - NASA does use STUDENT types of equipment that these boots, they have special, special articles of clothing that they were, but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things
        - So those things, they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions, but for this, they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about, to find out about the ice deposits
        - So, you are correct
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and the Lunar Orbiter, it wouldn't need the microscope
        - So you're partially right when you kind of say that the
        - I don't know if that's the truth is, I mean, I don't know, like that's the like a truthful, like a
        - Oh, that's really interesting
        - Let's talk about it, STUDENT
        - So your answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and that may be true, but um let's
        - I can tell you read part of the text
        - So again, that's true
        - And you're talking about water which is the questions asking you to talk about water
        - STUDENT right, but you're definitely on the right
        - You STUDENT are really thinking and I like where you're headed
        - STUDENT and Oliveron, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon
        - And you STUDENT are both on the right track
        - Yeah, yes, that absolutely would be equipment that NASA would use
        - Those are some great observations
        - But let's refer back to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I think you we're on the right track
        - And the scientific tool
        - Her perfect so STUDENT, you were absolutely on the right track
        - You're absolutely right
        - So a lot of equipment is huge
        - But what we have to do
        - I think you STUDENT did a great job and you were on the right track
        - Yes, that is in fact true, but let's focus on what the question is actually asking
        - Yeah, it said you would if you were to look closely, but how they discovered or how they found out that there was water on there
        - Was not with that microscope
        - So, you are correct on how scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I think that with STUDENT of her answers
        - We're STUDENT getting on the right track
        - You are getting to the right answer
        - They use the microscope to look closely at the water
        - Yes, I know what you mean
        - They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that
        - Well, that's very good
        - So the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right STUDENT
        - They need the oxygen to be able to breathe
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks
        - Okay STUDENT Let's look at your answer
        - You know, when they are in space
        - That is very true
        - So the scientists, they do need to use other other equipment so like the oxygen tanks when they go up into space that does help them
        - Yes, small, but it's actually smaller than small, microscopic is a really big word that means very, very small, small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool
        - That's a great question
        - When we say that you did actually use a microscope to see the water
        - You're partially right we're not entirely there, you're very right
        - That's absolutely right, but we're only Halfway right it's as if we have, you know, we're, we got a foot in the door
        - But we got to get the rest of the way in
        - So we are halfway,
        - so Farrah and STUDENT, yes, you absolutely use a microscope to see to actually see The water
        - I bet they absolutely did have to use some a lot of equipment to get to the moon
        - So absolutely use a lot of equipment to get up there, so you're not wrong in that regard
        - I can't imagine just you know stroll up to the moon
        - Yeah, they should probably do use oxygen tanks when they go to space
        - They need to breathe
        - And you're right, whenever they go into space, there's a lot of equipment they have to use to get into space, to get to the moon, to land on the moon,
        - They need that water to be able to drink, be able to survive
        - So your initial answer was correct
        - What do you STUDENT think
        - But what Miss STUDENT just read and what's advantages told us
        - It makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see
        - Yes, they did use oxygen tanks to find water, you know, but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for
        - So even though it wasn't, even though that they didn't use the oxygen takes to help them in their mission to find those samples
        - Okay, so looking at those
        - Yes, you wouldn't need those for space exploration
        - They do us STUDENT a lot of tools like that
        - We just had a fun one more tool
        - Well, it was right
        - You had one thing, but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right
        - Do you have any audio
        - So STUDENT helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope
        - But we're still trying to figure out what other tool even
        - So even you had said
        - So we found one tool
        - It says, what other what tools
        - OK, so the microscope
        - Is it wrong, but we've answered one part of the question
        - So now we want to
        - We want to find the other tool so microscope was correct, but we want to find the other tool also in our story
        - So you have one of the items we they needed to find water on the moon
        - Let's see if we can find the other item that I needed on the moon in the
        - No, I think you STUDENT helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time
        - It's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right
        - So your answer wasn't completely wrong
        - You did mention how NASA did send a small machine
        - I would love for you to use the actual your, your answer was not completely wrong
        - Yeah, so that is a pretty good response because the lunar orbiter is definitely a small machine and it is what they sent to the moon
        - And that is a really awesome response because that is definitely true scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Yeah, no, you definitely did and I do like that you used the oxygen tanks as the equipment
        - I appreciate that
        - So you kind of focused on that microscope that was at the very end
        - So again, your response isn't wrong you just focus on a different section of the text
        - Okay, so that is a really good thing to bring up Oliveron
        - That's a great answer
        - But the real word that we want to do to find here was in the last paragraph
        - It is a small machine
        - Yes, and that's great
        - That's what a microscope is
        - But it would, it wouldn't be the thing that found the water
        - Okay well after we asked the question, your answer maybe didn't include what the question was looking for
        - So, Jazmin and STUDENT also found different paragraphs
        - So there are multiple answers
        - yeah there's multiple pieces of equipment that's why I have you STUDENT answering any
        - The lunar orbiter is another equipment on and then, as their fellow classmate also mentioned in her sentences shall be getting to sort of them said microscopes yeah
        - um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up, but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence
        - You are correct STUDENT but not the answer is exactly looking for
        - That is true, but it's not fully insured
        - If you were to go up to the moon you got STUDENT that equipment
        - As I said, STUDENT else, your answer is correct, but it's not exactly the answer I was looking for
        - know your background knowledge is correct, but he's not the answer, or the way that I would have where did the answer
        - because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for
        - wide range, you could have multiple answers like how Farrah said they use the machine to get there, well, they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right, so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me, yes STUDENT
        - Alright, so STUDENT as I was saying there's multiple tools that were used to find the water, because we had to get there in order to find the water right so that's a really good answer
        - STUDENT, you started off your response really well
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA sent a small machine, you're correct that NASA was mentioned, so you got that part of it, but um
        - So your answer it's not okay you're not it's not wrong you're just not fully there okay so
        - So you're right about like a small machine is a piece of equipment
        - um your you, your answer was NASA sent a small machine
        - but there are some more evidence that can be used and also you said how you can't survive without water
        - Which is right, we STUDENT know, that's a known fact
        - but you didn't answer the question
        - But that it doesn't really explain why water being on the moon would be valuable
        - Well it's wrong in a sense that we're going to get to in a moment
        - Yes, yes that's a good point but we're focusing on the equipment they used to find the water
        - Not what they wear
        - You just need a bit more
        - So you're on the right path
        - So, that makes sense
        - so Farrah you have one part and STUDENT had the other part, and we need to add it together
        - STUDENT you are um you are on the right track, you do mention the microscope
        - yeah, so we are, microscope is part of that
        - yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer
        - Our answers are a little bit just -they're in the right direction but they're not exactly meeting expectations
        - I'll read it to you
        - So what's your, your response
        - Was NASA send a small machine, which is true, NASA did send a small machine
        - You need a scientific tool called the microscope
        - We also need
        - All right, STUDENT you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start
        - And that is very true
        - They use those equipments so many times a day in many different things, but it's not actually what they used to discover the water on the moon
        - Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use
        - I just think that I could see a little bit more room for improvement
        - You do? Well Luis I bet you have a ton of background knowledge on STUDENT of your science equipment, but I think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge, but more for you to look at the evidence from the text
        - but for this question it didn't necessarily ask for background knowledge, so what you said was probably would be used potentially to find water on the moon, but
        - For the question to look in the text to use the evidence and I don't think in the text, it talks about oxygen tanks
        - So your answer wasn't wrong
        - You said that NASA uses a lot of small machines they sent a small machine
        - I think you had a really great start to a response there
        - There both right, because in the text it actually talks about both of those things that were used to discover the water on the moon so
        - They did need that
        - STUDENT was right about that one
        - They use that, as well
        - It was just like I was telling STUDENT
        - So we want to also look at the question because sometimes we might find something that's in the text and we might say it, and it's very true, but it has nothing to do with the question that was asked
        - Also, sometimes you might answer and your answer is not wrong, but it's not answering the question that was asked
        - Yes, yeah, those are other tools that scientists use
        - It's good, it's okay that you chose the same answer that shows me that you STUDENT are highlighting the right answers in the passage
        - you're absolutely right that they found water on the moon
        - That's what our passage told us
        - you're absolutely right, so, while your answer is right that scientists do use oxygen tank sometimes when we were talking about water being found on the moon
        - but I don't think it answers this specific question and you understand
        - Exactly there's a possibility that the Lunar that there's a Microscope on the Lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon
        - Your answer is a great start okay oh
        - Yeah, it's really - it is really important
        - And but just because they didn't talk about it in the reading doesn't mean it's not important
        - so you weren't wrong I just think that you could build upon your answer to add more to it to make it even stronger
        - So I don't think that your answer so like I was saying that your answers are necessarily wrong if you're sitting in this STUDENT, I think your answers in the work that you did could use some improvement
        - and give you the same note that I gave STUDENT, although the answer is correct, I think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to Oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is
        - Your answer is correct, I just when i'm looking at the answers I know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong, it just can be stronger
        - I part of what I think with your answer is that although you stated they used a microscope,
        - So STUDENT your answer, although it did come straight from the article and the reading that we had
        - Well, there is a couple of answers
        - And then STUDENT, we're going to look at your answer
        - And it was really great, and I think that you really understood the text, but I'm not sure you quite understood the question that we were asking
        - Can you tell me what equipment they use so Farrah and STUDENT, you're not completely wrong
        - But that's not the full answer
        - A microscope is a piece of equipment
        - Do you remember reading that
        - Right, and then STUDENT and Deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water
        - It just wasn't correct for that question
        - It wasn't a bad answer
        - You thought through that
        - Your answer was correct
        - Right, so they might have used a lot of different equipment to get to the moon to survive on the moon field a walk around and breathe
        - They have to get us use the spaceship to get there, but we're talking specifically about to discover the water just like it says from the Reading
        - There's another scientific equipment that was used to specifically find the water because the microscopes going to help them maybe look at the water closer or look at other things, maybe just magnified
        - But they didn't use that to specifically find the water
        - I want to take a look even closer STUDENT
        - So wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it
        - STUDENT, just something you'd like to add
        - So the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators
        - What I just the only thing your answer is great because it's right from the text and it's saying why having water up there is important,
        - So yes, they did use some equipment to go to the moon, but let's focus in, on the other, bit of what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - But let's go and see if we can find anything specifically related I think you're STUDENT on a really good path, but we're not quite there yet
        - So that is one part of the one part of the answer
        - Okay, so there is another tool in there
        - And I completely understand that
        - So I love that you answered the question because your question is
        - Your question was right or your question was spectacular a plus
        - I'm going to say your question was right
        - If I had to say
        - Your question was wrong
        - So that's like, okay, you know, but I want your question your answer to be spectacular
        - The microscope is a tool that they use
        - But I think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use
        - Thank you for that answer STUDENT
        - So they used a lunar orbiter to discover the water and then they used a microscope in order to be able to see it closer, since it was so small
        - Teacher : So you were almost there
        - Your answer wasn't totally wasn't completely incorrect
        - Step number two
        - But now we need to put it STUDENT together
        - But you were missing step number one
        - So, STUDENT did a great job of explaining
        - Step number one and you did a great job of explaining
        - We need tons of equipment that we don't use down here, right
        - Oh, I'm sure that's absolutely right
        - They to go up into space
        - So we need to, there's two parts of this answer
        - And her answer with what STUDENT said in her answer, there's two parts
        - So we need to combine what STUDENT set
        - STUDENT, so it does
        - Wow, that's a great start
        - So you are right, they probably would need a microscope to see anything that's so tiny that you can't see with your naked eye
        - You're right, you wouldn't need the microscope in order to look at the water, but in order to find the water
        - So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks
        - I do think those would be helpful
        - But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water
        - But if we Investigate a little bit more into the text we might see that there was something that they used before they got to a microscope
        - We do use water to grow things
        - I'm not sure that that would work on the moon
        - You're exactly right
        - I don't think that we could
        - Um, I don't think that we could grow plants per se but water has other uses on the moon
        - Yeah, I think you're right
        - I think that it might take scientists, a long time to use that water, but that doesn't mean that it's any less valuable because I think that there are lots of different
        - Yes, that is true that the water on the moon is microscopic but as the first with the first step that we did with reviewing the question
        - But that's not what's really being asked of us
        - Did they say, did they ask about how do they see the water know they asked what was you to discover water
        - So yes, that is true that the water is so small you need a microscope
        - And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, STUDENT
        - So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon
        - That that's not quite really answering the question, like, as we go on
        - We are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine,
        - There is there is a part of the equipment
        - And yes, you're right
        - You say that the microscope is part of the equipment that they used to discovery water
        - But that's when they
        - You're right that oxygen tanks are equipment that sometimes they need to go to go to the moon
        - When they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there
        - Your answer isn't wrong because It answers the question, but we want to see if there's maybe a better answer
        - Sometimes there's two answers and one of them's a little bit more specific
        - so actually like that at this moment that's not exactly what the the object that they use is called
        - And STUDENT, you said NASA sense a small machine
        - Okay, and you know it you're actually correct
        - That's a great place to start as and thank you
        - even though I did like your answer
        - I think we can do even better job of answering the question
        - That would be like the best answer I can ever ask for
        - So I think if you included a microscope in your and your answer with the Lunar Orbiter
        - And if you want it bad microscope, you can
        - But it's important that we add that we have both things
        - So you are right on track to finding the right answer
        - Well your answer is actually not wrong it's just half of the piece
        - So yours was more of the smaller picture
        - exactly right, and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because, by the way, that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon, however, the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze STUDENT what's up
        - Oh unfortunately I don't think they use a oxygen tank in this time
        - you're right STUDENT when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right
        - yeah exactly Okay, so what i'm hearing from you STUDENT now is, we have two different tools that are really important in this
        - But what I really want you to focus on right now is what's important for the water right because it's true we we like I said when STUDENT we need those oxygen tanks right if we need to breathe
        - so I would kind of pair you a little bit more with STUDENT saying you're on the right track
        - But let's find the paragraph and tech the scientists like sentence and where it corresponds, because the answer was not oxygen tanks and I didn't see that, from the paragraph, so your job is to find a paragraph
        - So now we have two pieces of equipment right, so we have the Lunar orbiter that STUDENT talked about and her response and the microscopes man that you talked about in your response
        - You talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the Lunar orbiter and STUDENT you talked about the Lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment, because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery
        - Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and STUDENT talked about to discover the water
        - Okay scientist, or I can see a better one
        - yeah that's part of it, but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right?
        - You know I think you're I think you're right on track is there, if you look at the article, do you have the article with you
        - I think you're on the right track,
        - Okay, so it's possible that it's one of those two pieces of equipment they, thank you for sharing your thinking
        - yeah that's a really great point so for each of you what i'm noticing is that, like we may have spoken about one piece of equipment or maybe the other one
        - let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that, but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us
        - I think that is a great response, but I know that you could go even one step
        - Okay okay well that's it that is good that there's oxygen tanks, but to discover this water they're going to need more than oxygen tanks right probably going to need more
        - Okay, great so that's almost there I think if you had circled that whole sentence and they investigated the Lunar orbiter and then, if we put that together with savannas answer
        - Okay, so you would also use a microscope
        - So you're right you're both right that a microscope is a tool that scientists use to help them look closer at things
        - Oh, your answer is not wrong
        - They did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use
        - Alright, so we've got the Lunar orbiter and the microscope as our equipment
        - You know, I think that, in combination with what STUDENT just said um is the best answer
        - Well you're actually both right, so they use that machine called the Lunar orbiter to get to the moon, to investigate and see if there was ice
        - So you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water, but then, in order to see the water they use a microscope
        - huh yeah so I just want to say you're right NASA did send a small machine, but I want to push you to expand your answer
        - but they they weren't using the microscope to discover the water
        - so, for example, and STUDENT the answer Luis was talking about using oxygen tanks and it's true that scientists use oxygen tanks, but they did not use oxygen tanks
        - is something you would use to find water on the moon
        - Your answer is not wrong, actually, but it could be even better
        - So let's think about this
        - Do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water?
        - So I think if we consider what Jazmin said, and we add what STUDENT said, we might get a more complete picture of what scientists need to find water on the moon
        - So I think the three that we've identified so far, all together, will will lead us to a great answer and I think, specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text STUDENT do you want to say something
        - so that the machine necessary is the Lunar orbiter but the scientific tool that they want to use is a microscope So these are two parts of the answer to the question
        - um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better
        - Actually I think it's partially right
        - Great job, STUDENT
        - mm hmm right so that's partially right it's not a wrong answer but it's a, we could get close, we could get an answer that's more specific right? Okay, so I wouldn't say it's wrong STUDENT right, I think you're on the right track for sure
        - Right and so that's also getting to part of the answer right
        - So you both had part of the answer you said, to put it together
        - yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts, like the small machine when I began to investigate and I noticed ice deposits, but since they were so small, or to look at them, they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely
        - One second STUDENT, I will get right back to you, and they use a microscope they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate, so there was a couple of different things, yes, Chris?
        - yeah so that's what we're going to find out, right now, so based off of your answer it's just it's not that it's wrong it's just that we have pieces missing from the answer, so we got part of it right, but we want to get the whole thing OK
        - Right so in the same way, like how I spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you guys just STUDENT had parts of the answer correct
        - I think that might answer another question of how can they see the water
- intent: r110.1
  examples: |
        - And STUDENT I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.
        - hi Jazmin I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to STUDENT and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you
        - yeah awesome so you identify and equipment
        - Yes, ice and ice deposits, yes STUDENT
        - Yes, good the investigation part is good, let me look at the question again
        - Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah
        - STUDENT right, i'll let you think about that question, while I work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay
        - yeah that's a great answer STUDENT
        - STUDENT can I have just a second
        - yeah they do STUDENT
        - yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords
        - Absolutely, what about you STUDENT
        - STUDENT, what about you
        - But let's get back on topic
        - Um, well, you're right
        - Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question
        - STUDENT, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope
        - That would be really cool
        - A, then, what were you gonna say
        - You did some great reading STUDENT
        - Let's just hang out for a minute
        - Let's talk about some things
        - Okay hold on just a moment
        - He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - STUDENT right, thank you for your answers
        - You're right, you're right
        - I appreciate you guys coming in today you've STUDENT done a very good job
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And that question and you answered it
        - So you STUDENT did really good writing down an answer
        - I'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph
        - STUDENT right, well, that's awesome
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what STUDENT had said
        - I'm so glad you're ready to help
        - Yes, there is a lot of equipment that gets used
        - Yes, that was really interesting
        - I love that
        - What a good observation
        - That is really cool
        - I love STUDENT of those answers
        - Yeah, that was a big question
        - That's a really good observation
        - I love that
        - Okay, I like that answer a lot and STUDENT, would you like to add anything to that
        - That's very true
        - STUDENT, what would you like to add
        - Oh, let's wait your turn, please
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - You're doing a great job of listening
        - Thank you for clarifying that
        - Okay, let me let me talk with STUDENT for just a moment and I'll come back to you
        - Is that what you put
        - I have written, I have that you put scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay, while are you looking for
        - I'm going to talk with the other four
        - I'm really proud of you STUDENT for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - Oliver, you put the same thing I STUDENT
        - What I have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close
        - Okay and I'm going to talk with Chris and Jazmin and STUDENT
        - I saw you, that you put NASA sentma small machine
        - STUDENT in your answer
        - So very good job, um,
        - And I do want to give you STUDENT a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers
        - Just looked at your revised answers
        - So we'll talk about that here in just a minute
        - Yeah, NASA does have
        - Thank you for your input, Luis But I just asked STUDENT a question
        - Would you mind letting her respond?
        - Ah, there we go
        - Very good, thank you
        - Thank you for sharing now
        - So that is the answer that we're looking for
        - That is correct
        - And I think, Oliver you had said the same thing is STUDENT
        - Then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that Astronauts use
        - You said that they use lots of equipment
        - STUDENT Thank you for reading that again for us
        - So you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely
        - Well, that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer
        - And Deb, you had the same answer
        - Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah
        - That was something super interesting
        - That would be really, really great
        - Ooh, that would be awesome
        - Yeah, that's a really good question and answer
        - The next STUDENT about that topic, but I think that, yes, it's a very good topic
        - Maybe, maybe, maybe we can read another article
        - That's a very good answer
        - Yes, that's a really good answer
        - Yes, mean you are right
        - STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon
        - That's very good
        - I'm proud of you
        - Luis you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and STUDENT knocked it out of the park
        - Um, and I think another real benefit here
        - Chris and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like STUDENT had there and--
        - So, STUDENT, what's up man, how are you
        - I appreciate it
        - That means just paying attention
        - That's very smart picking that up,
        - STUDENT right, good job
        - And I know that's that's
        - That's, you know, that's interesting way to think about that question
        - Let's go back to Jazmin and STUDENT over here while you're looking at that
        - That'd be pretty cool huh
        - Oh that is just around the corner
        - On Musk is doing great things so
        - You know, they're working on it
        - Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope
        - So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found
        - So you found that the craters are full of water
        - Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water
        - Yes, and survey, Anna
        - So I want to go back to what STUDENT was saying
        - So you STUDENT were the same
        - So when you def
        - So let's go back to what STUDENT Do you have a question
        - Tell me about your answer
        - Let's STUDENT, let's go back to each for just a minute
        - Keep your thoughts, just for a moment
        - Okay STUDENT Let's hold on just a second
        - STUDENT, can you hold that thought for just one moment
        - That's a good answer
        - STUDENT, what would you like to add to the conversation
        - What was that question that you had?
        - Okay, Harisson, what, you had your question, a question just a few minutes ago
        - They did send that
        - So we could drink it
        - STUDENT said we could break it down to oxygen, hydrogen, we could breathe it
        - We could use it for rocket fuel
        - Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, so that could be one thing that's useful
        - I really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it
        - So let's go ahead and talk about it
        - Alright, thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers
        - And let's see, STUDENT, you talked about needing us scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, well if you hold on to that
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        - You said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - It's right on to that
        - Hold on just a minute and
        - Um, and now that we've talked about it
        - Alright, so let's see what STUDENT wrote
        - He recently wrote scientists found craters full of water on the moon,
        - It is important
        - We do agree on that
        - See that I'm glad you're still staying with our STUDENT, because that is some good insight
        - STUDENT right, let's see
        - Um, I think that would be valuable to
        - Um, yeah, I think, I think you have pretty good answer
        - Well, I think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here
        - So you did have the small machine is what you said
        - Your answer was actually really close
        - so like Farrah and Oliver you STUDENT said that you needed a scientific
        - tool called a microscope
        - Oh really, that is awesome
        - Well, I am glad that you know a lot
        - And you're right, and then also STUDENT also explain how the hydrogen oxygen can be split
        - So you guys you in depth said no and then Jazmin and STUDENT said yes
        - And then STUDENT kind of gave some details
        - Well, you might not need help, but you might be able to help me help the rest of the STUDENT
        - A very good way to look at that
        - Well, that's really cool
        - Oh, that's really cool
        - And I think that three of you Chris Jazmin and even I think you STUDENT had said yes it's valuable and you gave one of their reasons, and I think that was great
        - Okay, thank you for that input
        - And that was one of the tools that they are using what
        - Okay, well, I would love to hear that information that you can give us from this question that we've kind of want to talk about now
        - Yeah, that's really cool to STUDENT, what about you
        - That's really interesting that I'm glad you brought that into the discussion
        - I haven't read that, but I'll be sure to look it up
        - I said the wrong name
        - Yes, that's great
        - So and in your answer, you'd said that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - That's the sentence I want you to read
        - That's really good
        - Thank you for contributing that
        - STUDENT of you guys, I appreciate all of you guys volunteered to read, and you've all done a very good job
        - So let's get through, if, do you STUDENT have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil?
        - You could even say like
        - And or another way you could say that would be, that's a very good answer
        - Okay, so I'm going to start by talking with Miss STUDENT
        - So you said
        - Yeah, that would be awesome if we could do that
        - Well, can you tell me what the title of this was
        - That's really cool, STUDENT
        - They do have to use those spacesuits but well yes they do have to use them
        - And that's the only way they can be out there in space looking
        - I love how you found that in the reading
        - Okay, but I'm glad reading the text and you notice microscope was in there
        - I love how you were reading closely to the tax STUDENT, what did you find in the text
        - I love how you are also reading very closely and looking at the details in the story
        - That is okay
        - At least you were looking closely at your words why you were reading
        - Good job STUDENT
        - Okay, very good observation
        - While you were reading
        - Will you hold that in for a little bit and thinking about those spaces, maybe we can talk about that later
        - Very proud of each and every one of you
        - But each one of you did a fabulous job reading and looking at STUDENT the information and taking it in
        - So really good job STUDENT
        - Okay, well, there may be somebody here that does so let's STUDENT just take our turns and we'll see where it goes
        - So once you reread it, you found a different answer correct?
        - Okay, who would like to read the second one
        - Who wants to read the last paragraph
        - Okay so STUDENT, you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So I noticed STUDENT that you talked about a microscope in your answer, that right
        - You're good to go
        - Who knows but that would be really cool now
        - And you said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Alright STUDENT, I've heard some really great responses
        - Um, let's see
        - You STUDENT are doing a great job working together
        - They, they have to use a ton of equipment
        - So STUDENT, you said that they found craters full of water on the moon
        - And you said that they use a microscope so
        - Yeah, and it was similar to what STUDENT said
        - Well, you are correct on that
        - All right, STUDENT
        - I really enjoyed reading your response
        - They don't have to carry it in ships anymore
        - All right, STUDENT Chris you your response says water is heavy
        - So it's good
        - I hope STUDENT thought it was pretty interesting
        - Well, first off, I want to say thank you for for y'all STUDENT reading water on the moon
        - Like I said all of STUDENT did a decent job
        - Hang on one second
        - Let me ask STUDENT, what do you, what do you ever say, buddy
        - Well, looking at your answers
        - Uh, so, for example, a STUDENT, you put that you need a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Yeah, we'll go around the room and when I get to you
        - I'll let you ask your specific question
        - Mostly the same stuff
        - STUDENT right, good
        - So you could have the water to drink, but if you look back at the sentence STUDENT gave us
        - Savanahh, hold on, let STUDENT finish, but that's okay
        - Well, congratulations, you should be very proud of your dad
        - Yeah, so it's it's certainly mentioned that
        - STUDENT see that
        - Yeah, so that was certainly one, one way to do it
        - No, and so why don't we, why don't we answer my question first, and then I'll get right back to what you asked, okay?
        - STUDENT right, so great connections
        - I love this
        - Okay, that's a good response
        - Okay, so that's, that's right
        - So you said that you would need a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, so you noticed the mention of craters and so with water on the moon
        - Thank you very much
        - STUDENT for sharing
        - So thank you
        - Thank you for contributing
        - Right, so that's a good point
        - And you've seen lots of equipment that different astronauts and NASA scientists use
        - So you said you've been to NASA
        - So I do want to address that
        - I think that's a wonderful response, um,
        - STUDENT Luis said that NASA sent the Lunar Orbiter to discover
        - Faster gate to investigate
        - They don't talk about the lunar orbiter in the third paragraph, but we have Luis's answer
        - STUDENT, you are correct
        - You did you had that they used
        - That they use a scientific tool called a microscope
        - And that what the story tells us
        - STUDENT said the Lunar Orbiter
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter was used to investigate
        - It was my first scoffing
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter investigated
        - Hi, So I saw your answers and, STUDENT, it really looks like you're onto something there
        - That's a really good question
        - And you STUDENT gave us some really good answer
        - So let's see what STUDENT
        - STUDENT, so your answer is NASA send a small machine
        - Okay, STUDENT, so scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - And STUDENT, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So that means something that probably interest you a lot
        - I'm glad you said you know a lot about space
        - You said, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So now I'm going to help another student
        - And that's cool, you know that
        - NASA send a small machine
        - Well, first of all STUDENT I would just like to say, that's awesome
        - And then your answer
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So, water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - That's what you said
        - Yes, STUDENT, so on
        - Again, that you that you're reading about space
        - And that's awesome that you're excited about that
        - Well, I'm so glad that you already have some prior knowledge of space
        - But let's talk about the equipment that the scientists have used to discover water on the moon
        - So I can't wait to hear about what you know about
        - Hi guys, first of STUDENT I want to say thank you so much for your hard work and all your responses
        - You're exactly right
        - Thank you so much and I will see you later
        - Well you STUDENT did awesome today
        - Give me, give STUDENT just a moment
        - I think you're on the right track
        - So we have a small machine called a lunar orbiter so Jazmin's answer  Was was right
        - So with the Lunar Orbiter
        - That's true, but, that is true
        - So with the microscope--
        - Okay, we will get to that in just a second
        - STUDENT Can you hold your question for me for a couple minutes
        - And STUDENT even pointed out in your part that scientists found craters will have water on the moon
        - And so, Farrah and STUDENT your answers are the same so you both said that they, the water is microscopic right
        - That last sentence there
        - But thank you, STUDENT for that now
        - The for part three
        - Is he really we'll have to talk to him after school about STUDENT this stuff that you're learning about
        - That's a great idea
        - We'll have to do some more research about that another time
        - I wonder if that could happen
        - What did you underline and paragraph two?
        - Thank you for sharing
        - All right, Miss STUDENT
        - thank you for that
        - That's good thinking STUDENT
        - Yes, I can see
        - Are you can you say that
        - STUDENT Do you have a question
        - I could see how you could come up with that answer
        - Yes, that's correct
        - I could see how you could say that yes
        - I could see how you say that yes
        - Okay, fair enough STUDENT you have a question
        - And STUDENT, you read your response was that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Who wants to read the second second paragraph
        - We will get to that in just a moment
        - Give me a moment to identify some of these words because, I don't know about you STUDENT, but some of these are kind of difficult to understand at face value
        - I'll get to you in just a minute
        - So you're not just standing there Holding it up the whole time
        - STUDENT I see your hand, you can put it down
        - We'll use will use that enthusiasm here in just a minute
        - So bear with us for a little bit
        - Thank you for using full sentences full complete sentences, full of correct grammar and STUDENT that nice capitalization
        - I appreciate that
        - they're going to come back to that in just a minute
        - Let's move on to the name is tiny STUDENT I believe I'm reading your name right
        - Is that right,
        - See you said you circled the same thign as STUDENT
        - Allright class just to recap for my own sake I believe we went over Farrah and Oliver and STUDENT
        - You hopped back in believe STUDENT, you just had a question
        - STUDENT hold on just one moment
        - Yeah, we were on your answer
        - And your answer
        - Yeah, that's where we were
        - I'll read it verbatim scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - STUDENT, put your hand up for just a minute we'll get to you in just a moment
        - So let's go back
        - Your next up
        - but for time we're gonna move on over to STUDENT
        - I'm going to read it for STUDENT so we can remember says scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - actually let's go on to your answer
        - I'm going to go over to STUDENT, since we're low on time, Jazmin
        - You had your hand up
        - What were you gonna say
        - Luis Let's move back over here real quick before we hop over to STUDENT I see your hand, you can put it down,
        - Yeah, so I think that's really good information
        - I want to bring us back to the question, though
        - And I appreciate you sharing with us
        - They said that scientists need a microscope to find water in the craters on the moon
        - And in fact, yet
        - STUDENT You keep on looking for that
        - And I know that STUDENT, in fact did mention microscopes in her answer
        - And you said that they use the microscope so Farrah, I'd like to turn to you and STUDENT You keep on looking for that information
        - I'll turn to STUDENT Farrah
        - See, we have to use a microscope to be able to see those
        - So you STUDENT are completely right about the winner equipment and the microscope,
        - It would definitely be valuable, but not something that is feasible on that moon
        - So that's something valuable about this water on the moon right even though it's microscopic
        - So maybe you have something you can contribute to this STUDENT
        - You don't? Well, I'm, again, this is a more of a discussion based exercise
        - So we'll, we'll, we'll come back to that here in a minute
        - Okay, so we have, it's heavy
        - And we have the we believe us not valuable yet STUDENT
        - You can use it to grow things
        - So rocket fuel will be a use and STUDENT, you could drink it
        - Okay, and like STUDENT said, oh, we can use them for rocket fuel
        - Right, so you all now know here, STUDENT
        - So I'm not real sure we would have to read more on that and see exactly how they used it and what they felt, maybe they discovered with it
        - So we might read another article and see what we can find out
        - So STUDENT, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to work really closely
        - Okay, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, so you, you said that they found the crater for water
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, so
        - So, STUDENT, you said that NASA spit seeing a small machine
        - I love your answer that,
        - So you STUDENT did an awesome job of looking back in the story
        - Dave, you said you circle, the same thing as STUDENT
        - STUDENT, you said you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely I lock that answer
        - And here's an use its scientists film craters full of water on the moon
        - Men Jazmin, you said NASA send a small machine and then STUDENT You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - I love how you said you needed a scientific coats tool called a microscope
        - Okay, so I love how you did that
        - So, STUDENT said NASA send a small machine
        - Alright, a microscope
        - STUDENT, you said that I sent a small machine
        - Right so STUDENT did an awesome job
        - Exactly, so we can always write that too, I think your answer right now is just as good though
        - that's a good point
        - So good answer to or like how different everyone's answers were and I felt that you STUDENT explained what the tools were used for in a perfect way
        - So, STUDENT, you said that NASA send a small machine to the moon
        - I'm STUDENT I want to talk about your response
        - You said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So looking at the other responses
        - Um, but I think I'm going to talk about STUDENT's response really quickly so Chris, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - awesome that is a really great response so
        - That sounds great
        - So you're right
        - Yes, you are completely right that there is, there's a lot to kind of dissect in this
        - But you did
        - So that was good
        - But still really great thing to think about because not STUDENT thought about that intheir response
        - Good, I'm glad I could hear your own words
        - Good job, STUDENT
        - It's one of the right answers
        - Yes that's one example, that is an example of a piece of equipment
        - That is a good question
        - Okay, thank you STUDENT we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes
        - We will go over your answer in a few minutes right now we're focusing on STUDENT but i'll have time for you to explain your thinking
        - alrighty then you'll be able to explain your thinking to me as soon as i'm done talking to Jazmin STUDENT right
        - Thank you alright STUDENT so, you said that NASA sent a small machine now
        - So yes, so tell you told me that
        - um you need oxygen tanks to be on the moon
        - And that is a piece of equipment yeah
        - We'd love to have you, STUDENT
        - So we'll start with STUDENT I your response was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Your response was, scientists found crators for water on the moon
        - STUDENT So you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen, oxygen tanks your responses
        - That is correct
        - excited you know everyone forgets once in a while even I forget i'm so we'll move on to STUDENT
        - Good good good job I like that I like that could reply STUDENT I see your hand up
        - Sometimes i'm used to mess up but i'll go on to yours and your responses, yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water on
        - That was a great response so see how
        - That would be amazing I will do anything to do that
        - Okay, yes, good way it's super important
        - That's a good feedback
        - Yes, you can
        - Okay, I like that answer
        - I dont know, maybe
        - that's really cool and i'm sure we can circle back to that when we finish our discussion then we're just going to finish up first okay STUDENT
        - Alright, so we'll come right back to you STUDENT, how can I help you
        - Okay, okay, I'm moving on to STUDENT
        - First, STUDENT, I see what you were saying
        - When you said, the tool the scientists needed for water was a small microscope um
        - I understand that you had a similar response to STUDENT
        - Exactly that's a great observation Nathan, and a growth strategy to continue with
        - yeah exactly and similar to what I said to the other two students
        - Oliver, I remember you said that you have the same answer as STUDENT
        - Also another thing that I noticed
        - You said that use the
        - And then so STUDENT, you gave a really good response
        - You, you said they use the scientific tool called the microscope
        - Okay, so in order to do that, like in your response
        - And then STUDENT, you talked about how they found craters
        - So for now STUDENT for you, you said that scientists found water found craters full of water right?
        - So STUDENT back to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon correct yeah?
        - And Oliver for you, you just said that you have the same answer as STUDENT
        - Okay well give me one minute i'll keep, I'm going to tell STUDENT what I want her to do and then i'm going to come to you
        - so going to you i'll go to you next and then STUDENT, I can talk to you
        - OK, well, if you think your-- if you had the answer, then someone else who didn't have that answer want to try again
        - But that's not really quite part of our reading but that's really-- it's something interesting to share with the STUDENT
        - Yeah, that's really interesting
        - Yeah, that's really interesting
        - I'm really glad you shared that
        - So you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look more closely
        - And Oliver, you said you circled the same as STUDENT
        - So you said NASA send a small machine
        - They do use a lot of other stuff like that
        - Um, so your answer
        - You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - They did so we're going to look at the next paragraph after that paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth
        - It doesn't totally relate to water, but that is a really cool fact
        - yep 100% true STUDENT
        - Perfect so now that we've taken the oh yes
        - And Oliver, I noticed that you said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - So so so Oliver I noticed that you said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - i'll get right to you in just a minute
        - And then I want to talk, I also wanted to talk to STUDENT, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - perfect and now STUDENT, I also wanted to talk to you, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Alright, thank you so much
        - I would yeah just to reiterate what I said
        - So STUDENT, you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely
        - You indicated that we would need a tool called a scien- a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely
        - Alright, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - STUDENT are you ready i'm ready awesome so, you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - know STUDENT your response was you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly
        - Perfect I will get right back to you after that okay okay perfect
        - You are right about that
        - That is perfect clapping for you, that is awesome Thank you perfect alright STUDENT
        - Alright perfect you take a minute, while I go over to STUDENT
        - STUDENT that's awesome that's perfect that's a great sentence and you got great answers
        - That is a perfect response
        - Yes, it is excellent
        - that's excellent Oliver so glad that you're listening and paying attention in STUDENT
        - So now let's look at your responses
        - So Farrah you circled the same thing as STUDENT, and so, you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now I mean
        - So I noticed STUDENT, as you said that, um, scientists use this specific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You had agreed with STUDENT
        - Really good job
        - You STUDENT did a really good job
        - Good job, and they're awesome you STUDENT
        - Thank you STUDENT for sharing those specific equipment with me
        - The first time
        - Your answer is great
        - You did a good job
        - You did an awesome job to that
        - Those are awesome answers, and I was great job, knowing that i'm waters chemical was h2o that was awesome STUDENT what's up
        - So she's will me that NASA send a small machine STUDENT
        - I'm going to ask STUDENT, a question first
        - So, STUDENT said NASA center small machine
        - You told me you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Let's see, you're right
        - Is tell me that we need a microscope to look really closely so
        - All right, so STUDENT let's talk about the answer you gave me to the question, so your answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - yeah you're absolutely right, so we talked about that
        - Absolutely, and that shows me that you really understood the text and what everybody's saying and before we move on intimacy you have your hand up, but before I answer you
        - I i'm so glad you're having so much fun, but what I want, I want to talk about your answer, so you told me that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - I think that's a great question and I don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it
        - You guys have lots of great questions, and I think you know a little bit more than I do, even about what's going on up in space, but they definitely my I think that's in like I said for STUDENT that's a great question to write down that we can look into as we talk more about
        - Exactly STUDENT could you now respond and tell us your answer?
        - Great awesome good job i'm so
        - yeah you STUDENT you did awesome great okay
        - that's a good start so um maybe
        - In the craters, perfect
        - You can definitely ask the teacher
        - that's really good information
        - Right, so you told me that we can split up
        - Water into hydrogen and oxygen right
        - So the as that
        - That is a really good answer
        - So you said that they needed a specific tool called the microscope
        - that's a good point, yes, and last paragraph, I see I see um
        - Okay, so you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen and what I like about
        - STUDENT, let's start with you
        - So you said scientists found craters are full of water on the moon
        - Now Oliver, you said that you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - So STUDENT said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Let's have STUDENT the chance to answer his question
        - You did a great job
        - I'm glad you were listening STUDENT
        - Okay so STUDENT You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - I think that that was a really great answer in response to the reading and the question
        - So you said that you need a scientific tool called the microscope to look really closely
        - So Oliver so what I noticed by saying you know by you saying that I circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - yeah and you you're correct STUDENT you did do that um
        - Alright so STUDENT, you mentioned in the text that scientists use a tool called a microscope
        - Okay, great response STUDENT
        - I feel like you have a little bit of surface up
        - You happen to know what the lunar orbiter is
        - Water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen
        - Really? So i'm trying to clarify Luis's answer, but I will move right on to you after okay
        - By 2024 wow that is very interesting, we never had a base on the moon ever
        - So you and STUDENT both had very good answers
        - So your answer was really, really, really great
        - And I really enjoyed it
        - Okay, good job, I guess, I can write that down okay
        - STUDENT, do you want to share too?
        - It's a dark, dark place
        - You need tools to see them
        - STUDENT right, so you said that NASA sent a small machine to the moon
        - Alright Farrah and great job and are you STUDENT worked as a partner
        - All right, so let's start with STUDENT Farrah, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - awesome that's a great answer
        - Okay and Oliver, you said that I, you said I circled the same as STUDENT
        - and then Davy said NASA sent a small machine and STUDENT said, scientists, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - equipment awesome you're right, you're right
        - A lunar orbiter awesome
        - so let's look
        - Right you're right STUDENT
        - Right, and that's STUDENT That was your point
        - That might be a good idea
        - You get alright so let's look at some of your answers and we have that STUDENT and Deb, you had similar answers right you both said  You need something like a microscope to look really closely
        - So, I'm sure, that'd be something you'd be really interested in learning about
        - Thank you so much
        - Was very nice answer STUDENT
        - Great job, STUDENT
        - That was awesome
        - So can STUDENT add on to what you just said
        - Thank you for that information
        - Well, STUDENT, who do you agree with
        - Thank you for sharing your thinking and for telling us what the text is mostly about
        - Thank you for your connection Jazmin and for adding more detail and STUDENT
        - STUDENT I see your hand, will call on you next
        - Um, thank you STUDENT you are very close
        - Teacher : Okay STUDENT reread and then I'd like to see if you can get a different answer
        - STUDENT do you have a question
        - Okay, so you still think that lunar orbiter is a good job
        - Okay so Oliver and STUDENT than right he got the right idea
        - Very, very cool
        - I love that you mentioned the Lunar Orbiter,
        - That's a very good point
        - Okay see nods from STUDENT
        - Okay, so I love everyone's answers to these
        - You're right, they do use tons of different equipment
        - Yeah microscope is like a tool
        - And then I'm gonna get back to you
        - Wow, that's very interesting even but I'd really like you to focus on The article right now and then you can tell me more about that later
        - Who else would like to share
        - Who else would like to share what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, maybe I guess we'll have to wait and see
        - Right, yes STUDENT
        - And I see that you answered scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Teacher:Okay Luis I want to hear what you have to say it's so important, but I was still asking STUDENT if she could build to her answer because I want to know if there's more to the article than just water on the moon
        - Awesome, thank you for sharing
        - Thank you for sharing
        - Wow, thank you for sharing
        - I'm happy that you were able to learn from each other
        - That your answer reads, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - I want you
        - Awesome, thank you for sharing
        - And I will be so happy to hear
        - Let me just finish up with STUDENT first
        - I'm going to work with you independently in one minute
        - STUDENT There's so many different ways that astronauts can use water
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        - It's such a valuable resource
        - Thank you so much
        - Thank you, STUDENT appreciate that
        - Thank you, STUDENT, for sure
        - Thank you for that
        - That's also a good point
        - Thank you STUDENT
        - Yes, convincing evidence
        - That's very important
        - But yes, your first portion of the answer that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - I agree that that's that's crucial piece of information for us here on earth to you, none of us can survive without water for sure
        - that's true I agree that's a super that's really helpful for NASA
        - I love that then we could have moon flowers
        - equipment great that's an excellent word to circle Thank you
        - Water great that's another awesome word in our question
        - discover great that's definitely our action word discover
        - I think, can you just let the STUDENT finishes answer and I will get back to you later
        - yeah i'm glad you find the differences and
        - So yeah, we're going to discuss more of this later
        - Oh yeah, you're correct
        - Yeah, there is another important we're in this question
        - Thank you STUDENT
        - So coming back to you STUDENT
        - Yeah, there is another important word in this question because we're, we're talking about finding water on the moon
        - So that's the main idea
        - That's the main equipment that we use but STUDENT has excellent ideas and now I know that everybody read this text and everybody has knowledge about this
        - So I am very impressed with your, with your answers
        - So STUDENT, you said you end up both said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, you said that scientists found craters full of water in the moon
        - Yeah, they're definitely studying it in order to find the water, um,
        - STUDENT I will get back to you in one minute
        - You can reread the passage right now
        - STUDENT I will answer your question in a minute
        - Those are two important aspects to focus on
        - It's, it's, um,
        - Thank you for pointing that out
        - I wanted to speak with you about
        - I'm thinking about how
        - Yeah, that's, that's definitely something that could happen if there was enough water on the moon
        - Yeah, so that's one of the purposes that they That they pointed out
        - Yeah, so really cool thing
        - Hmm, that's a good answer
        - Does STUDENT else have any any any ideas about that before we get into talking about it?
        - So I'll go back to submit
        - So that is the answer the question for us, but I'll come to yours
        - So your answer was, I'm going to look back at at the answers you STUDENT bad
        - So she said, you need a scientific tool called a Microsoft to look really closely
        - That's a good answer
        - So yeah, I think you guys did a great job with the text STUDENT
        - Great memory, word for word exactly what the question was
        - It is a tool, you're correct
        - I'll keep that in note and I'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had
        - So let's right let's write that down
        - But thank you for volunteering
        - You STUDENT are doing great
        - I love the participation so far from STUDENT
        - Think about it for 15 more seconds, then I'll come to you
        - Yep, just give me a moment STUDENT
        - I'm going to have STUDENT
        - We can talk about your experience and you can share that with the STUDENT
        - And maybe at another time
        - I think that they would learn a lot for me
        - Alright class, so I heard STUDENT your answers and I thought you know I really liked how you put a lot of thought into it
        - yep exactly you said it perfectly yeah
        - So I liked your answers STUDENT I liked the line of thinking
        - Definitely um yeah, STUDENT
        - huh yes and a couple of you STUDENT did revise your answers and you did a great job with that revision
        - yeah great job STUDENT
        - Oh wow that would be really cool
        - really great and Would you mind sharing with me is your name pronounced Hosni or STUDENT
        - Thanks for thanks STUDENT I appreciate that
        - Very good that's exactly right
        - Absolutely you're totally right,
        - that's correct the microscope is not on the moon
        - that's Okay, and I think we will get there, but um yeah I really appreciate you trying
        - Oh okay Oh, I see, let me hear other other people
        - yeah they use a lot of equipment, so the research on things to find
        - I believe so, yes
        - yeah that's a great observation good job deb Thank you so much that's exactly the kind of answer we were looking for when we are trying to figure out
        - What equipment scientists use to discover the water on the moon, but STUDENT of our other observations were also really close so
        - yeah STUDENT, I had a similar, but I did not know that they could find water on the moon
        - STUDENT, I completely agree with you, I also was very surprised I did not know that there was water on the moon, so this text was very illuminating for me that I learned something new
        - STUDENT that's a great word, you know i'm gonna write that down to make sure that I remember that discover
        - so I think you circling discover is a great Just a great choice for yourself
        - I think that let's see what some other of your classmates circled as well, but I do think that your answer made complete sense when I was reading over the question,
        - so thank you for being our first brave volunteer to share thanks STUDENT
        - yeah that was wild Chris,  STUDENT else read something that I thought was interesting
        - Okay, so here's what i'm hearing so much about your experience going to NASA and I definitely want to hear more about that
        - All right, thank you for sharing that STUDENT let's dig into the question a little bit, then
        - yeah that's definitely interesting to think about
        - yeah that's pretty important
        - Okay well let's dive in a little bit, thank you, thank you STUDENT, both for repeating the question, it's okay that it sounds similar
        - Yeah thanks for sharing that
        - yeah that's definitely what's so important about this right STUDENT thanks for sharing that
        - um let's move on to Chris, and then STUDENT I'll come back to you if you're still confused by the end of it okay
        - I see, that I understand
        - Jazmin let's give STUDENT one more second okay so Chris double check that
        - that's a great definition Thank you so much STUDENT
        - that's also a really great idea Thank you so much STUDENT for sharing that with us
        - Alright, I see some head shakes
        - those are both really great definitions that we got from Luis and STUDENT
        - the microscope is a really great tool that lots of scientists use
        - that's awesome um so how about we just like put a quick pin it, we're going to come back to this microscope idea
        - yeah that sounds great
        - Could you let it STUDENT finish his sentence and then you could go next
        - Right so perfect STUDENT
        - Right that's very true
        - that's very cool that's very interesting
        - Oh that's a great answer STUDENT
        - yeah oh yes you're right why why we need to live on the moon
        - awesome and Oliver and I know that you and STUDENT were working together Oh yes, I see your hand go ahead
        - Great job STUDENT getting us started with that retell of the passage
        - Alright, so I want us to take a pause
        - hmm um what are you thinking STUDENT
        - STUDENT, let me just get back to you quickly
        - Good so in this question whatever you're looking for STUDENT i'll get back to you in a minute one second okay
        - excellent job you, you really enjoyed you really, really great you really impressed me with your answer I love, how you
        - yeah i'm so proud of you, you would that really impressed me okay
        - STUDENT i'm sorry, have you to wait for a while, so go right ahead, you have any question
        - STUDENT, what about you
        - So thinking about the tools that the scientists use to discover water on the moon, I know you STUDENT mentioned lots of different equipment the oxygen tanks the lunar orbiter the microscope sometimes they just found it in craters
        - that's exactly right that's exactly right, so you know we have this lunar orbiter yes STUDENT
        - i'm going to come back to you and i'm going to come back to you to STUDENT
        - They do the they do use oxygen tanks uhmm
        - Thanks for adding Luis yeah I don't I think they have to use a bunch of different tools to look and so thank you for contributing your opinion STUDENT, do you have a question
        - yeah that's very true they use a lot of a lot of high tech tools like computers and
        - Farrah and STUDENT I know you said that it
        - STUDENT you, you had a similar response, you said that no it's not not ready yet so maybe
        - Oh yes, that is where exactly it says that the ice deposits are very small,
        - yeah they definitely use a lot of equipment, though
        - yeah you so you feel you're STUDENT good
        - And I really value how STUDENT has talked about water being really heavy and it cannot be carried on ships anymore Chris, would you like it, yes samana
        - Okay yeah discover good
        - You know STUDENT about space?
        - yeah I see you have great observations and can we think, can we help Farrah and STUDENT figure out their answer first?
        - Sure, thank you for your patience
        - So, Farrah and STUDENT, you find out -circled the microscope, right?
        - So STUDENT you told me that NASA sent a small machine right?
        - I think that is, I think that is an excellent definition and that actually makes me think of something different that maybe helps my understanding
        - I agree, and STUDENT did you want to add to that well
        - yeah that's perfect in fact that that brings us over to eton's point in in STUDENT your point about science is finding craters full of moon on the water
        - Okay that's that's an answer, how about you STUDENT What did you say
        - Okay, and how about you STUDENT
        - yeah STUDENT go ahead
        - STUDENT noticed that in the passage is didn't mention astronauts
        - is called know the Lunar Rover I think
        - Alright, so thank you so much for those responses, thank you for the hard work that you put in
        - Yes, equipment for discovering water
        - There's one more piece to that
        - Farrah and STUDENT, you circled the part about the microscope
        - So let's go back to the text
        - Great john Chris, awesome teamwork STUDENT
        - All right, thank you so much for sharing that Farrah did I see you raise your hand STUDENT
        - that's a great point STUDENT so thank you for pointing out why it can be kind of tricky to answer questions like this
        - And so we've done a really great job going over the answers to the first question,
        - that's great so that was good that as as a STUDENT
        - Right, so that was a good lead STUDENT so thank you
        - yeah from the story that we read exactly STUDENT
        - STUDENT What did you pick
        - discover that's also a good word
        - Okay does anyone else have a response, thank you STUDENT
        - So let's hear from one other person, and then we can talk more about your concern, is that okay?
        - how about the rest of you did what did we say for this question that we'd like to share with the rest of the STUDENT
        - how about let's hear from somebody else anyone else, want to share out there and to our STUDENT
        - Oh yeah that's really interesting STUDENT do you want to quickly share what you have said
        - that's true okay so that's a very interesting fact
        - Oh scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Water great okay that's a great idea STUDENT
        - Great another great keyword
        - equipment that's interesting okay so STUDENT circled equipment
        - let's talk about what STUDENT said before she said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great point a microscope is a great scientific tool
        - Well that's fair yeah that's definitely fair okay
        - Hello friends Thank you so much for revising your responses to the question what equipment did scientists us to discover water on the moon so Farrah Chris and STUDENT, thank you for sharing your revised responses um Does anyone want oh yes Luis
        - I love that and your response was very interesting and we're going to we're going to talk about each one okay
        - awesome I think so too yeah STUDENT
        - Her mm hmm okay
        - yeah yeah absolutely that's great
        - Okay we'll leave that there STUDENT you have a question or a comment
        - Okay, that sounds great
        - Good good final answer
        - So if we could start with STUDENT he said NASA send a small machine, could you tell someone
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - Thank you for that information, yes, I agree with you, I think it
        - They definitely need something to collect the water that's excellent STUDENT,
        - rocket ships, they definitely need rocket ships
        - you're off to a great start
        - yep exactly STUDENT a lunar orbiter good job
        - yeah I agree it seems like STUDENT of the all of the words in the question are really important
        - Thank you for sharing, though, and thanks for being a team player
        - yeah um I think that you mentioned that
        - Someone mentioned oxygen tanks in their answer
        - yeah, of course, and that's going to come back again later, when we talk about our next question
        - Oh okay um so maybe, could you hold off for one sec STUDENT
        - yeah I mean it's really incredible to think about the progress we could make and STUDENT the discoveries, we can make
        - yeah that's exactly right that's what i'm thinking to face is pretty incredible so we'll have to wait and find out what these scientists come up with
        - Okay Okay, so we have a microscope that we can look at to see the teeny tiny water
        - Okay, thank you, thank you for sharing
        - cool and you STUDENT are just on time
        - yeah Thank you so much STUDENT
        - Oh, your answer is NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, very good, very good
        - so STUDENT you mentioned that there's a microscope
        - Yes, very good so again, it would be but
        - yeah if that's what how the scientist goes and discovers water, yes, but again
        - STUDENT, you said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right? Okay, Oliver, I think you said you had circled the same as Farrah, right?
        - Okay, thank you STUDENT um okay so let's start
        - Okay STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon, great
        - And STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - And STUDENT you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - STUDENT right, that is true
        - Okay, good job STUDENT
        - yeah you did a really great job
        - That you thought that they need a scientific tool called microscopes look really closely
        - so Jazmin I know your answer was that they had small mush oh yes STUDENT
        - Okay, well, thank you STUDENT
        - It was it no, it was used to investigate
        - exactly they use those to find them on the moon
        - We can start with you to say, you said that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - We would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, so you said that you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Right that's also a good point STUDENT
        - All right, well i'm going to start with STUDENT and then we'll come to your answer and we'll take a minute to take a look at it
        - Farrah I see you i'm going to come back to you once i'm done with STUDENT
        - Jazmin and Luis i'm going to get to you in just a second, I see that Farrah and STUDENT have their hands up
- intent: r310.1
  examples: |
        - awesome so Farrah and STUDENT get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points
        - amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you STUDENT have collaborated on Even better answer
        - and I love that you STUDENT are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to
        - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well
        - I love that you brought in that background knowledge STUDENT that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
        - Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story
        - yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
        - yeah so STUDENT I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
        - yeah I love, how you summarize that are STUDENT, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris
        - yeah STUDENT that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so
        - yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
        - So um STUDENT what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
        - right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon
        - Absolutely yeah no, these are STUDENT great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece
        - I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
        - So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
        - Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space
        - Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that
        - So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
        - That's a good way of thinking about it, STUDENT
        - You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
        - And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that
        - That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
        - I like your revised answer and that you STUDENT work so well together
        - But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also
        - I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see
        - And I appreciate that answer
        - You did a great job using your background knowledge and using STUDENT the information that was in our text
        - That was one of our right answers
        - It was a right answer
        - Well, I appreciate that
        - I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that
        - And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
        - So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
        - Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money
        - Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy
        - I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind STUDENT that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
        - Um, so I can see STUDENT I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source
        - You did a good job
        - Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence
        - Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,
        - That's a very good point
        - So you could circle convincing evidence together
        - Yeah, that's a great idea
        - And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
        - Even if it's not valuable right now
        - Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
        - Now, but in the future
        - So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable
        - It would be
        - I love that STUDENT, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if
        - I love that you cited where you found it in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true
        - Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
        - And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing
        - You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
        - I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from
        - Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true
        - STUDENT, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out
        - And I'm really proud of you for finding that
        - Oh, what a nice way to explain that
        - Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small
        - Which is great and you STUDENT refer back to the text
        - You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
        - Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use
        - Thank you for that
        - That's a some awesome prior knowledge STUDENT
        - So I can add a bit of background info here
        - Um, so, STUDENT Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space
        - And you offer a lot of insight,
        - That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from
        - Well, maybe I phrased that poorly
        - I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
        - I think that's very good
        - I like your use of detail there
        - And that's, that's very good
        - I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
        - You give really good strong details on that very specific part
        - So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
        - Okay, that's, that's great
        - I think you've got the main idea
        - And so at the heart of your answer there
        - And that's really exciting
        - We found some water on the moon
        - Thank you very much for listening
        - Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
        - So I appreciate that
        - That was very good
        - What I said there
        - Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
        - That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out
        - But when we look back at the question
        - Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as STUDENT, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking
        - And that's a good skill
        - I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and STUDENT were able to look specifically in the text
        - To use our background knowledge like STUDENT used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right
        - We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
        - Now I can see since you already have a lot of prior knowledge about space, how, why you would come up with that answer
        - And that is a great answer, our passage
        - I can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope, you would use a microscope to see it
        - Well, I can, if you went to NASA and you actually saw STUDENT of those things I could, I can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned
        - And I see why you would say that,
        - I see where you get that answer,
        - I like your thinking that is awesome
        - You use details from our text to support your thinking
        - So, that's awesome
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking too so awesome job using evidence from the text as well
        - It is like a tool that scientists use when they are discovering things
        - So, that was a really good explanation and definition of what equipment is
        - Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience
        - What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
        - Good thinking, because we are talking about water
        - We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more
        - Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us
        - So let's see
        - Water is a valuable resource right
        - One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
        - Because that has the words we were just talking about
        - So that was just the right place to look for that
        - And you did find some evidence, didn't you
        - All right, let's see, when you STUDENT are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look
        - So you guys are STUDENT given really good details
        - So you STUDENT are given really good details for that
        - I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
        - Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment
        - So I think that you justified your answer and
        - So I think that you and Chris and Luis STUDENT said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable
        - And I spoke to STUDENT
        - So he justified his answer
        - So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
        - You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right
        - Um, I think we STUDENT had our reasons and justified our reason
        - I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
        - But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated
        - Of the water and how the water could be used
        - you summarize very well okay and about the craters
        - You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer
        - That is great
        - I like that answer
        - Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading
        - And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get STUDENT the information
        - That's absolutely right
        - I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, STUDENT
        - They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
        - And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
        - But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
        - What about you,
        - I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - You are good
        - That's exactly right
        - So like you said your answer
        - And it looks like you've done that in your answer
        - STUDENT, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why
        - So great job
        - Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right STUDENT
        - I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water
        - But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool
        - That was very good
        - I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that
        - Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text
        - And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
        - I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
        - Yeah, yeah, you're right
        - So try to think about
        - Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer
        - I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
        - Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters
        - You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
        - And you also found that they both talked about water
        - Now what did the question ask us to find about water
        - You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good
        - They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,
        - I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know
        - So right after that the paragraph
        - We want to be in, you're exactly right
        - Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes
        - Okay, so you did find some important information where
        - So, you made a really important
        - Good, I agree that they're not ready
        - No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know
        - They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
        - They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question
        - And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence
        - Yes, that was very good
        - I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good
        - And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
        - And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it
        - Okay, so we'll keep going
        - Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,
        - So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it
        - Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine
        - So you're in the ballpark
        - So you found the equipment
        - And I like that you use that wording scientific tool
        - I like that you use that word scientific tool
        - Great, great job there,
        - And I really appreciate you explaining your answer
        - I do understand what you mean
        - Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer
        - And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right
        - I agree with you
        - Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there
        - I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready
        - So you guys have STUDENT shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good
        - I really liked that you STUDENT tried to pull your evidence from the text
        - Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you STUDENT did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text
        - Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff
        - That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space
        - So that's a great job be able to identify what that means
        - So you STUDENT did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
        - And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable
        - Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer
        - Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,
        - Okay, well, you know, good job
        - Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen
        - STUDENT you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly
        - that is very good job
        - Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it
        - Alright, so let's first look at the question again
        - And I was very impressed about how STUDENT took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking
        - A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective
        - Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon
        - You made a connection a detective
        - She used like a STUDENT use that his dad was an astronaut
        - So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive
        - So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope
        - So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer
        - So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong
        - And so I love that y'STUDENT are all thinking about the story and are using
        - Using the text to help support your answers,
        - I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together
        - That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon
        - You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like STUDENT
        - And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion
        - STUDENT, and that was perfect
        - I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later
        - So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you
        - You know that answer makes perfect sense
        - You do a great job of talking about the question
        - As far as that goes
        - So you obviously understand the question
        - So again, we're just going to that
        - So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important
        - So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence
        - You do a great your answers
        - Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - You can't survive without water
        - And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion
        - what I would really like you to do, though
        - Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it
        - Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things
        - You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence
        - That is that is a great piece of text evidence
        - That was a great thought process, putting those two together
        - Okay so convincing evidence and valuable
        - And that is correct
        - And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction
        - And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer
        - So I appreciate you looking at your
        - Answer and asking why
        - I like how you're making that connection
        - Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question
        - I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section
        - So, good job there Oliveron are deaf
        - Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that
        - Good job, they're reading into that
        - Yes, that is true
        - I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you
        - I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer
        - He did a really good job
        - I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us
        - That's actually very well done,
        - And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
        - I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,
        - Yeah, that makes complete and total sense
        - That was a good job connecting the dots there
        - It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter
        - So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific
        - And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as STUDENT
        - Your thought process is a lot deeper as well
        - First of STUDENT, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail
        - Great, that's, that's really good STUDENT
        - So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found
        - Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question
        - It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon
        - And you're right
        - You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope
        - I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit
        - Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits
        - Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters
        - Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen
        - And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water
        - Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen
        - Right, well, and I love that you STUDENT were able to close your eyes and see that and help you Oliverelop that
        - So you found that directly in the text
        - That's really good
        - Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer
        - Okay, I understand that
        - but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation
        - And I just like that
        - That was your example
        - Okay, so just like STUDENT I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be
        - um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to
        - So STUDENT you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is
        - awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks
        - And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like STUDENT is saying
        - he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text
        - Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question
        - That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um
        - And you were able to find that in the text good job
        - Great job pulling that out of the text
        - So I strength so far from that was, um, you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good
        - I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence
        - For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question
        - Do you think it's a good investment um I thought I thought your answer was great because, like
        - You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said
        - You um I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and
        - um so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of
        - Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county STUDENT messed up if you know what I mean well
        - STUDENT your response is actually really good
        - I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
        - That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for
        - Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there
        - I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,
        - So it was a great response
        - You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text
        - So what you said related to the text really well
        - And STUDENT, I think you had some great vocab sorry, did you have a question, Jazmin
        - yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of
        - i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was
        - But you use great academic knowledge
        - nd great academic vocab in your response
        - So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good
        - But you used great academic vocab in your response
        - They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two
        - And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers
        - I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful
        - Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better
        - Awesome you got that right from the passage,
        - mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water
        - So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,
        - STUDENT, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback
        - awesome so I see what you did,
        - and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer
        - awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,
        - awesome So yes, that included the important details
        - You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,
        - let's look at the last sentence, because I like what STUDENT brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money
        - And STUDENT I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon
        - I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon
        - You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?
        - So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon
        - Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon
        - That's a really good strategy
        - STUDENT, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer
        - Thank you for pointing that out, STUDENT
        - And thank you STUDENT for explaining your answer and using the text really well
        - answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's
        - You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where
        - Um so STUDENT I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading
        - It talks about specific things that the question asks
        - and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um
        - A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um Farrah and Jazmin you STUDENT really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate
        - So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use
        - And she answers NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine
        - Yes, thank you, that is
        - is really, really nice way to phrase that
        - that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer
        - I love, how you comprehend the reading so well
        - and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one
        - And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water
        - I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did
        - you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but
        - Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you STUDENT read the reading and understood it
        - I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you STUDENT interpreted interpreted the reading,
        - I definitely can see how you would find it confusing
        - and i'm glad that you STUDENT didn't notice that when you guys read,
        - I do agree that it does say other equipment that Thank you
        - Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great
        - They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from,
        - Oh, even you bring up a really great point
        - I saw that you use your background information when you
        - Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver STUDENT did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great
        - Good so Chris and STUDENT you both found specific information for the text so that is great
        - so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,
        - Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but
        - Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that
        - And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary,
        - And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response
        - Now you you've built on your response
        - So that is a great response
        - i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool
        - awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three
        - I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer
        - awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response
        - The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment
        - awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used
        - Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you
        - Thank you so much for sharing your responses to me
        - I want to particularly point out, Farrah and Jazmin's responses you STUDENT did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use
        - Naming the exact specific examples of equipment
        - I pointed out, Farrah, and STUDENT, both of you had done a really good job from the beginning
        - Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that
        - And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that
        - Luis, I know that you were talking about STUDENT your knowledge
        - OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you STUDENT used in your responses and that's amazing
        - And you did a really good job with that
        - So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?
        - So that's what you did
        - You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted
        - It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean
        - by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,
        - See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good
        - We do use that in science STUDENT, but
        - That was actually really good
        - One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things
        - You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right,
        - I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon
        - that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that
        - Just not a great connection
        - mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article um,
        - You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you
        - Right, I really like that, just like STUDENT, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text
        - I really like that answer
        - I like that you gave reason to why you think that um
        - um that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer
        - um which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there
        - That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you
        - So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like STUDENT I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions
        - Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer
        - I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text
        - You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text
        - And STUDENT that answer was really great
        - um yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear
        - That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that
        - That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point
        - And I'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence
        - I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from
        - is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job
        - did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing
        - I like that you did state yours like your agreement or disagreement in this case, you would did agree, and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon, and they could drink it so your answer, you had a very good answer
        - I like that was very clarifying
        - I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information
        - And I like that you really pulled that from the text
        - Great so I love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment, we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer, that is a great job
        - yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph, and I understand where you would get that answer,
        - I love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about NASA and that they sent a small machine
        - STUDENT, your response was really awesome
        - STUDENT, your answer was really awesome
        - I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific
        - And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article
        - Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before
        - yeah I understand I understand your confusion
        - How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you STUDENT
        - STUDENT that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon
        - STUDENT it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously
        - And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article
        - So that's great that you were able to point that out
        - It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article
        - So a microscope is a type of equipment
        - That's very smart
        - That's a very good thing to point out
        - There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon
        - you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely
        - So that would make sense
        - And some of your science classes, maybe
        - So if you use one before
        - I love that
        - Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great
        - So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence
        - Good to look really closely
        - So I like how in your answer
        - STUDENT, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon
        - Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy
        - And it takes up a lot of space
        - You have put the steps together very well in your brain
        - They need things to even be in space
        - That is very, very, very good
        - STUDENT and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer
        - I like that you expanded your thinking
        - STUDENT, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well
        - And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good
        - I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence
        - That there isn't much water on the moon
        - STUDENT, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer
        - Right okay good, so I, like STUDENT of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text and use your best work to get to where you are
        - So I can see where you would say microscope oh go ahead
        - That was wonderful thinking
        - I loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better
        - And I wanted to say, STUDENT
        - But I did
        - I loved in your first answer that you agreed with STUDENT, because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking
        - And that's really important and learning
        - I like your second answer better because you put it in your own words
        - And thank you so much for using that sentence starter
        - That is a great answer
        - So both of you found your answers somewhere in the text, you were, it was clear that you read the text and I really love that you were looking at the text, you definitely read it, or at least looked at it, which is great
        - Okay, Deb, I just want to say I really love that you listened to STUDENT and listening is such an important skill as a student
        - Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her
        - That's a really great skill
        - And even I value STUDENT that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing
        - I love that you've used your listening skill and you listen to Farrahs answer
        - STUDENT That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text
        - Thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said, it seems like you're asking, How come you didn't get full credit for your answer
        - I like that you gave a specific tool
        - It's great to read our answers directly in the text
        - I like how you took your answer correctly from the text
        - So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly
        - Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text
        - How you even expanded your thinking just now
        - Yeah, I really appreciate appreciate that you were looking carefully at the question and exactly the words is equipment
        - Yeah, I really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question
        - You really gave us the evidence you found in a text, the importance of water
        - I really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question
        - Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for STUDENT the passage when you answer the question
        - Yeah, I like it
        - You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer
        - Teacher : so I could see you, how you got confused there
        - Teacher : Right, so I could see where that would get confusing
        - Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great
        - It gives us almost like a little step ahead
        - But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better
        - It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that
        - And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great
        - So you have text evidence from the text
        - I like that you use the background information, though, STUDENT, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more
        - I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is
        - I love that you went and use a specific example from the text, right, that was
        - No need to feel bad
        - Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text
        - So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater
        - I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use
        - I see how you got that answer
        - I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine
        - So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon,
        - Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see
        - So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon
        - Looking back at the text and adding more detail
        - But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking
        - Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story
        - I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important
        - Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew
        - Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon
        - I'm really glad that you that this STUDENT was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences
        - That's a really good skill to be able to have
        - I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water
        - So that's what's called like texts to real world connections
        - Where we found that from is from outside now
        - So that's a really good skill to have
        - Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great
        - So I can definitely see where STUDENT got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk
        - The ice is found in the crater
        - so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that
        - I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information
        - And I really like that you brought up that point
        - You are absolutely right
        - I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us
        - Now let's see some other answers STUDENT
        - I really liked that you noticed that NASA had sent a small machine
        - So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, STUDENT
        - And I love how you pull that answer for number two
        - And I love how just like STUDENT You're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important
        - And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it
        - I love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool
        - Thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer
        - Thank you for that STUDENT
        - So you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding
        - That was that's a much more specific detailed answer
        - They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did
        - and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer
        - yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff
        - awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space
        - awesome great and I love how you're STUDENT looking back at the text
        - Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my
        - Locating this into the second paragraph
        - And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts
        - Okay, so, um, I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words
        - Answer is not wrong
        - Okay, that's great evidence to support it
        - You STUDENT brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that
        - That's a really good point
        - Yeah, so I see both of your points
        - So I like that answer
        - but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text
        - I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive
        - And what it did was it three great things
        - He told us what equipment they use and what it was called
        - That was awesome
        - Thank you for that
        - I love your answer
        - And you use that to make a complete answer
        - And so, so while you're here
        - So I like that you found some details in the article
        - Let me talk to you and STUDENT
        - um yeah Okay, I see what you're saying
        - awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me STUDENT
        - That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it
        - um that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that
        - yeah it does seem like that would be really important
        - hmm I definitely understood that um you were looking for different
        - Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details
        - that's great STUDENT and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic
        - And STUDENT you have your hand raised before
        - Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think
        - Yes, so STUDENT I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of
        - I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering STUDENT
        - And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing
        - And that's a really great question that's what I bought to STUDENT, but when I read about the
        - yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your
        - Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text
        - yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but
        - Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from
        - So just using that one sentence STUDENT and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job,
        - yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon
        - but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes STUDENT
        - Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track,
        - Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right
        - that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is
        - I like you added STUDENT that in there and accessed your background knowledge um
        - mm hmm so the miscroscope is the equipment that we might have had more experience with
        - You might have seen it or heard of it, so I can see why you would have picked it out from the passage
        - But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it, so I love it you like expanded that an understatement That was good
        - But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic
        - Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text
        - awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use
        - scientists definitely use microscopes
        - That was a good connection
        - Okay STUDENT I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move,
        - Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if
        - makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that
        - lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that
        - and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so STUDENT why don't I just start off with you
        - Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job STUDENT However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so
        - yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, STUDENT right, you did you did either disappear job excellent
        - awesome well, I really enjoyed your response STUDENT because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and
        - I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there
        - So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me STUDENT that are really, really great job
        - OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly
        - awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent STUDENT go right ahead
        - yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and
        - I love how utilizing STUDENT the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed
        - That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good
        - that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the STUDENT and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class
        - Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,
        - I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead
        - yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing STUDENT this thoughts great
        - yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay
        - yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it STUDENT right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead
        - that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there STUDENT that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it
        - It's always a great idea
        - Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure
        - got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you STUDENT really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - That would be easy for you to sign and come back to
        - I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text
        - That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own
        - so STUDENT used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is
        - that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point
        - I love love love that you brought up that example that's that's what's called an analogy, and it is a great analogy STUDENT
        - I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text
        - It is, I see how you mean that connection
        - Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part
        - yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any
        - but I see how you came to your conclusion
        - I think i'm I see how you got to your answer
        - yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest
        - Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable
        - Yes, I see how you found found you got to that
        - Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting
        - Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting
        - now let's take deeper STUDENT I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon
        - Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you STUDENT and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern
        - Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about STUDENT the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration
        - Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest
        - Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response STUDENT I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end
        - Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, STUDENT, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water
        - Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because
        - And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment,
        - Oh yeah that's a good idea
        - I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um
        - yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text,
        - And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his
        - And STUDENT I was curious with your response
        - I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope
        - yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science STUDENT i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class
        - Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used
        - Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon
        - Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but
        - And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing
        - i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills STUDENT so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay
        - yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking STUDENT yes
        - I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that
        - Yes, STUDENT I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge
        - awesome so I saw in your answer STUDENT that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon
        - Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing STUDENT is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge
        - I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes STUDENT
        - That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information STUDENT that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job
        - Hello everyone, I just want to say thank you so much for sharing your answers with me, I can tell by everything that you guys put down that you really understood this passage and done a great job looking in the text, for your answers STUDENT
        - that's a great point STUDENT, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky
        - But I think we STUDENT did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question
        - Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that,
        - I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense
        - Oh really great point STUDENT Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does
        - And then for Chris and STUDENT I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part
        - Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question
        - ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right
        - ooh really great detail with your Farrah I loved how you did STUDENT those three steps right, you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does
        - it's in the text right you're exactly right STUDENT great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm
        - Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because
        - Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete
        - I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer
        - that's a great point
        - that's a great point STUDENT
        - Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and STUDENT so
        - Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there
        - yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used
        - Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is
        - because sometimes readers, even if they don't have STUDENT the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking there
        - Okay, I love that you STUDENT brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses
        - Okay, so I think that you STUDENT did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter
        - Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing
        - STUDENT I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with
        - You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great
        - Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your
        - So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm
        - that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand
        - That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem
        - I like that you found relationship between the words
        - It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you
        - I think that you you STUDENT circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space
        - Okay, I think that's a great strategy that you're using so yeah, so I think that is an important part of the question, what blah blah blah like does that or what equipment and then what are we looking for with the equipment
        - Nice, I, like the way that you're using the strategy to kind of pull apart the important parts of the question
        - yeah so thank you yeah so I like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water um and great
        - Nice yeah so thank you so you're right, it is equipment, which is what we're looking for and you found it in the third paragraph I like I use the text
        - yeah so I definitely like the way that you're going about this about answering this question is you're thinking about equipment and they're thinking about equipment us to discover or find or look for the water
        - yeah so I also see the Lunar orbiter in paragraph two
        - yeah I like how your second half, got a little bit more specific after our conversation
        - yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools, so that was a great revision
        - Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy
        - Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with STUDENT, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy
        - and I really value how, in your answer you STUDENT directly talked about a piece of equipment
        - I agree yeah oxygen tanks, is an important piece of equipment for astronauts so I really like that you included that in your response
        - Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because
        - STUDENT right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words
        - Great well, I really appreciate how you STUDENT chose to look for a piece of equipment
        - awesome, and so what I really like about what you said STUDENT is this word machine that you mentioned,
        - Great yeah and STUDENT when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned
        - Yeah great, so I think STUDENT I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine
        - STUDENT you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable
        - The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you STUDENT use textual evidence in the text um, but how do you think
        - Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um
        - um I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation
        - um you STUDENT located the information in the text very, very well um
        - I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?
        - And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope
        - Ok? Great job
        - Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way
        - that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading
        - mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good
        - That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections
        - good job STUDENT
        - Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job
        - Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found
        - so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools
        - yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used
        - Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer
        - Great and then STUDENT you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks
        - So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here
        - And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be
        - Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope
        - So I see that you got your answer from the first paragraph
- intent: r210.2
  examples: |
        - So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember
        - It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense
        - Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean
        - Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that
        - Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof
        - Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer from that source
        - Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it
        - So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - We're not trying to look at it, STUDENT, did you have something to tell me
        - We're trying to discover it
        - What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right
        - And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that
        - Yeah, STUDENT those things are really important
        - But in this article
        - So what does equipment main STUDENT
        - So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water
        - Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question
        - That means the same thing
        - Does STUDENT know a synonym for the word investigate
        - Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking
        - They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right
        - We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So when we look back at our text
        - So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object
        - You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment
        - So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters
        - But what tool where they using?
        - It's telling us to talk about what equipment
        - But if we look back at our question
        - So we need to find the equipment that they used
        - They did find water
        - But the question wants to know what equipment did they use
        - But what equipment did they use to find it?
        - That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        - But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon
        - It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used
        - It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment
        - What are the ways that it's being used
        - Or how can it be useful
        - If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking
        - That would be your question
        - What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it
        - And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment
        - So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?
        - Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,
        - It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon
        - But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph
        - but we said when we circled in the second key word
        - In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word
        - It's something that they did
        - But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you STUDENT to find was evidence and valuable yes def
        - So we know where it was
        - I wonder, it's asking about the equipment
        - So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it
        - But now we're asking about the machine
        - So they're synonyms of each other
        - So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym
        - You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool
        - do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking
        - So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?
        - Finding it but planning it for the first time
        - And remember, we're looking for equipment
        - So we're discovering water on the moon
        - but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it
        - Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon
        - We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist
        - Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of
        - Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for
        - Did they use to discover the water that's what STUDENT is saying
        - Yeah, so that's a really good question
        - Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like STUDENT says the equipment that's used to discover the water
        - Equipment discover and water
        - So you STUDENT picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover
        - Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and
        - Do you STUDENT know what discover means
        - Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon
        - He is to discover water on the moon
        - So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist
        - So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon
        - But let's look more at that question
        - So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?
        - but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment
        - Did they use to search for water on the moon
        - They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment
        - They're looking for quick the equipment
        - So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon
        - let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars
        - Can you remind me what the question says,
        - But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering
        - I'm glad we're able to see that
        - A STUDENT Do you think that's a good idea
        - It talking about more than one piece
        - So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there
        - It could be more than one
        - But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural
        - And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water
        - Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water
        - So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water
        - So putting that together
        - Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable
        - It has the potential to be valuable
        - That means it may it that is going to be valuable
        - The water on the moon
        - What am I doing
        - So when I think of that word discover
        - And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something
        - What are we doing STUDENT
        - When I first discover something
        - I'm looking for it
        - So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water STUDENT
        - I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it
        - I remember STUDENT said when we discover something I'm finding it
        - So what what might they have used to first discover
        - So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right
        - Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon
        - Did they used to discover
        - Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things
        - But the key was what equipment
        - So, so we needed to find the equipment
        - So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it
        - So the key was what equipment
        - Did they use to discover
        - So we looked at discover because that was one of our key words because there was a lot of tools that the scientists used that they talked about in our text
        - So what does discover mean
        - STUDENT, what is discover mean
        - Yes, that is a very good question
        - So they were focusing more on what they used to find the water specifically
        - Okay, so what do we think valuable means
        - So we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it, but our question says, Is there evidence that the water could be valuable
        - What do you think that means
        - So this is asking could water from the moon be useful
        - Okay, awesome so valuable means that it's useful
        - So do we think that water from the moon could be useful to our scientist
        - You think yes or no
        - So, um, do you know what equipment means? Do you know what that word means?
        - So when you are reading this text, you're looking for an equipment that this text is discussing
        - Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms
        - Who remembers what term
        - There's a term
        - And the question that we're looking for
        - So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right
        - Water is important
        - Yes, because the question does ask about water
        - There are key words
        - And there's one more word that we use a lot in science
        - STUDENT right, I'm convincing is good
        - Okay, so what is evidence
        - So STUDENT those equipments
        - But we was looking for the tool for water
        - But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water
        - So yes, you're right
        - Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them
        - So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage
        - So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage
        - Teacher:I feel like the way the question was phrased
        - They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um
        - I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water
        - I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water
        - You might have STUDENT that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water
        - You know why its valuable
        - It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons
        - In the actual passage
        - So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable
        - That would be very beautiful, very
        - Did you find that in the text STUDENT
        - So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon
        - So is there convincing evidence
        - So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article
        - That water on the moon could be valuable
        - What it says directly
        - Now this is a tricky question
        - Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word
        - So what is the meaning of valuable there?
        - So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?
        - Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water
        - But how did they discover the water
        - I know they can look at the water with the microscope
        - Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space
        - So in the question asks us
        - But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space
        - It says what equipment
        - Where did they find it so
        - Did they use not
        - But in the question
        - So I agree
        - They used to look at water is it what they find the water with
        - Is it talking about how they water or is it talking about
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence
        - And I want to specifically look at the question
        - So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves
        - So what does it mean to be valuable STUDENT
        - And let's see, I wanted to talk with with um
        - And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank
        - We're talking about water on the moon
        - Do you have any really important words in that question
        - Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So when you discover something you're looking for it
        - They have to investigate
        - Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?
        - What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?
        - But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find STUDENT that water because it
        - In the story, which Chris brought up so that STUDENT had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found
        - And they also talk about craters
        - How to find water on the moon, don't we, yes STUDENT
        - So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question
        - The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water
        - Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you STUDENT about
        - We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water
        - So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct
        - Did they use to discover water
        - So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment
        - So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage
        - And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water
        - How about the word evidence and the word value
        - So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out
        - Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question
        - There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them
        - So you're going to be looking for our
        - but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology
        - Did they need to discover that water
        - When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that
        - About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it
        - But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand
        - So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon
        - What, what are you looking for?
        - Okay and machines and tools that do what?
        - So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water
        - Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading
        - Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of
        - Water on the moon
        - That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water
        - What did they use to find that
        - So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon
        - but what did they use it first to discover it so
        - Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use
        - So specifically, what do they use not their suits
        - But what they use to find the water
        - Does that make a little bit more sense
        - But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Want to know what did they use to find that water
        - But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is
        - Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover STUDENT right there
        - What do you think buddy
        - In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon
        - Okay well equipment is the key word
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment
        - I agree with you
        - What do you think buddy
        - Those are all very important words STUDENT
        - Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable
        - OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important
        - Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,
        - So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable
        - So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense
        - How can water be valuable
        - But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our key word here is equipment
        - So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that
        - So our key word here is equipment and discover
        - And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does STUDENT can answer
        - Now, what, what does it mean if something is valuable
        - Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable
        - Right, something that you can use
        - Okay, that's great
        - This question is
        - Another way to say or state
        - It's just asking
        - Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence
        - It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things
        - So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water
        - So what equipment do they used to help them discover water
        - So that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe
        - So we think of convincing evidence
        - What does that mean to you, STUDENT
        - What does convincing mean
        - Okay, STUDENT what does convincing mean?
        - STUDENT what is convincing for you
        - So we're talking about convincing evidence
        - Evidence means information that supports the statement being made
        - So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports
        - And that is a great answer
        - Can STUDENT help me explain what the word discover means?
        - But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important
        - Within within the actual text
        - What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon
        - but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them
        - But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters
        - Okay, let's talk about evidence
        - What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be STUDENT
        - Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?
        - And we're going to discover evidence and proof
        - She's exactly right
        - Alright, so, STUDENT
        - Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope
        - Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon
        - It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question
        - And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me
        - Back, here on earth
        - So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?
        - Okay, that's the question
        - Does STUDENT here know what the word equipment means
        - Those are STUDENT types of equipment
        - And so what about the word discover
        - Do we STUDENT know what the word discover means
        - So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon
        - Excellent Harris and that is when you find something
        - So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon
        - So to answer your question, STUDENT and deaf so far
        - Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon
        - It's not the question is not asking necessarily about
        - The way they found the water because the water is very small
        - The key word is
        - It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water
        - Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use
        - So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon
        - But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water
        - We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for
        - So it's a new
        - It's new to you
        - That's absolutely true
        - It's new to whoever finds it
        - So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - What is that question asking?
        - We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water
        - So this is an argument piece
        - But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value
        - So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable
        - Can STUDENT give me another word for equipment?
        - Does STUDENT take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment
        - Well, first of all, can STUDENT tell me what equipment means
        - So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about
        - Absolutely, you are on the right track
        - So can STUDENT give me a synonym for the word equipment
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - First of STUDENT, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means
        - Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, STUDENT, I want you guys to
        - turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask
        - what that question is
        - Asking, What are those important words
        - So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment
        - So what kind of things
        - So first of STUDENT, I want to make sure
        - So can you give me
        - I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon
        - Because I think, judging by some of your responses
        - Another example of a word for equipment, STUDENT
        - What does it mean, what does it
        - So let's look it specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped
        - The scientists find water on the moon
        - What do you think the most important word in that question is
        - Very good and STUDENT
        - So we are looking specifically for equipment
        - And so when we look at our text, we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water
        - Right so discover is our most important word in that question
        - My question for you is, what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space
        - We already know about the different types of equipment what keyword
        - Okay, so let's look at our question
        - Again, we have what equipment we used
        - In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment
        - The question uses the word discover which is the same as find
        - So what we need to look at in our, in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time, right
        - Alright so what I'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth  Investing in
        - Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon
        - Okay, so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it,
        - Keywords something important to help us find it back in the text
        - So we are going to use the same strategy, the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question
        - Have we already found from this heading
        - So what key word from our question
        - What's the word in that question that gives you a hint at where to look in the passage
        - STUDENT when you hear the word equipment, what comes to mind
        - Good, so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object
        - And then we need to find the equipment
        - So when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - We know that water has been found on the moon
        - So when we read this passage
        - So when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment
        - What words did you STUDENT underline
        - I like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two key words to help us answer this question, Chris and STUDENT
        - That's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question
        - So the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so
        - Well, that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon
        - Discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question
        - Okay guys, so let's come back together as a STUDENT
        - I like how you said discovered that is correct
        - It's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word
        - So those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment
        - To help us answer this question
        - I think that's what it's mainly asking
        - Okay, so we STUDENT did
        - So we know that scientists discovered water on the moon
        - So we know that part already
        - So now we get to figure out with the equipment was
        - So the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon
        - It's asking from the passionate itself
        - I like that you Circle the word equipment that will really help you find in the passage, what the answer
        - I like that you circled the word equipment, just like STUDENT because that'll help find the answer in the passage will have to look for the word equipment and see if you can find the correct answer
        - Very well done
        - I like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the Moon
        - The what the designed to send to the moon to find the water do you can you find that in the text
        - What did they use to find the water
        - Right now we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon
        - But that's not what we're looking for
        - But right now we're looking to see how they found the water
        - What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon
        - So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks
        - They did need the microscope as Farrah, and STUDENT mentioned
        - They did need the microscope as Farrah, and STUDENT mentioned
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - But that doesn't help them find the water
        - So if we go back up and we see that
        - However, if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's our buzzword right there, discover the water
        - So the three of you STUDENT have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water
        - You also said that discover and investigate were really similar
        - And although it was microscopic
        - Um, let's see what NASA sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you guys think are really important STUDENT, would you like to add something
        - I think that um, you know, earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article,
        - Does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon
        - And that and what do you think about that
        - And what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope?
        - But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it
        - Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules
        - If you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or Oliverice specifically used for that purpose
        - In a way, yes
        - But this is also why science questions are a little tricky
        - We are focusing on the specific action of locating water
        - Now for this particular article that we're looking at
        - This question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable
        - But it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is even
        - This question was specifically looking for
        - it's kind of a two part question, if you think about it, because you're weighing out what would be valuable about the water to the astronauts like
        - And so, some would say yes, and some people would be no
        - Well, to me, when I think of the word valuable, I would say that I think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question, the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future
        - Okay, so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon
        - now if you go back to the question, the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water
        - now, they did find water on the moon, but what equipment, did they use to find that water
        - That okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay
        - And that's okay um if we think back to Jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and, if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water
        - So equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to
        - The moon so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there
        - So it can be taken in multiple different directions, some people could be very like how you guys each said, one thing, but if we bring it STUDENT together, we have all the equipment, we need to find the water on the moon
        - Okay yeah no problem, so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water
        - So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for STUDENT five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage
        - And then look for equipment that helped to discover water
        - So those are your key words
        - As i've been saying to STUDENT those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really, really important when finding the answer in the passage
        - um So the question is, is there evidence and you said no, not for a long time, so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage
        - So the word evidence, what is it what is evidence, can you tell me what evidence is?
        - So and then is there, so is there facts that can show if water is valuable
        - what does the word valuable mean?
        - facts yeah yeah so it's facts, information, details that can help
        - So valuable can also be something that we need
        - Yeah, so when we think of value most of the time we think of money
        - Helpful is another word instead of using valuable
        - It's something that's helpful to us
        - So something that can be helpful
        - So is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit, so it can be easier to understand, because there are some big words in there, like evidence and valuable So is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us?
        - Okay, so the two words that I think are the most important that I heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover
        - Does STUDENT know why discover would also be an important word in the question?
        - It's an action word, yes, because what, what are we doing? What is the question asking?
        - So they're trying to discover the water, does STUDENT agree? So now I want everyone to look at the reading
        - STUDENT of these answers are correct, but I want to look at the word equipment and the second one, I noticed no one circled was discover
        - Does STUDENT know why discover would be an important word in the question?
        - Excuse me, sorry I was confusing
        - Because it's an action word, because the scientists are discovering water, but how does -sorry discovering it
        - That's the action word
        - Okay, so I see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable Do you know what the word valuable means
        - so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water
        - So i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself
        - That's true, but the question is asking what equipment
        - So, what tools do they use to find those craters
        - But we're asking what equipment was used
        - So craters full of water means what they found
        - What did they use to find the water
        - The to look at the water
        - So the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Equipment usually means tools or systems
        - So let's think about the words in this
        - So find something or know that it exists on the moon
        - And then discover is another big word in there and discover means, how did they find water
        - However, the question is asking, how did they find the water
        - So they use it to look at the water, but what did they use to find the water?
        - So breaking down the question does STUDENT know what the word equipment means
        - So does STUDENT know what the word equipment means?
        - Can someone raised their hand and offer to explain it for us?
        - Equipment is just some tools or machines that we use to decide to do an action
        - So yes, that is what equipment is
        - So, for example, in the text we can say that some of the
        - equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text, but just in general astronauts use helmets
        - Okay um well just by going over the word equipment, I wanted to make sure that STUDENT knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not everybody understands the question and then sometimes
        - Can somebody explain the question to me real quick?
        - So STUDENT understands the question
        - yeah So what we can say what tools or what
        - Instruments did they use
        - But that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and I know you circled the same thing as STUDENT, but I want to hear from you
        - Well, I think that the question was asking was sort of asking that if you knew that NASA used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking, would you say that's good equipment is
        - But the question is,
        - Did the scientists use to discover the water, not where is the water found
        - But what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon, and maybe use your texts to answer that question
        - But I was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax
        - So i'm going to reread the question and once I finish, I want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer
        - So the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what do you STUDENT think the question is asking for
        - Right so in the question, it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing STUDENT of this
        - What you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water, the key words in here, I think are equipment and to discover water on the moon
        - But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found
        - But for this specific question, we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon
        - So um first let's go over it, so the question can anyone tell me what off the bat the question is asking? yes STUDENT
        - Okay so STUDENT, then, can you explain to me what the question is asking?
        - mm hmm So what is the question looking for and it's answer
        - Good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not
        - Next, STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but how what equipment did they use or in the text
        - What equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon? Do you know?
        - But what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon,
        - that's STUDENT right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when I say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources, something that we can use, so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water, the water that's on the moon
        - Does STUDENT know what that means?
        - Does STUDENT have any ideas of how we can share evidence? Sometimes we can use a quote
        - It could just be anything that's written on the text
        - You can quote someone that said something, or you can quote what the author says, what the text says
        - It doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text
        - But maybe, we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that, OK, you know what this says, we need to focus on the tools, we're going to focus on the tools
        - And this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine
        - So we definitely use the microscope to look at the water, but the question asked which equipment, we use to find the water first
        - The evidence that we put out here is wrong, it is valuable, but then, how do we get that water is also another question, we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing
        - Chris just something else to add to the STUDENT
        - We still see that as valuable, so I think that, just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right
        - Do you remember what equipment do you use to find it?
        - I think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools, help them discover more water on earth, excuse me, not on earth
        - But for this, we're wondering what they're using for the water, you know? So we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use, we're thinking what are they using for the water
        - So they do use oxygen tanks
        - but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking
        - STUDENT right, and what's, the key word that they're asking for
        - So we could reward that you find in the text, what equipment they used
        - Anything keep the craters We just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay
        - yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water, but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know
        - So, for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt? So when I look at that question, there are a couple of very important words that question
        - The other words and the question don't really have much meaning
        - What makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what, but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt
        - The important words in the question, are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read, so you want to look in the question and see
        - Alright Chris Jazmin Luis and why do you like to share the word that you STUDENT chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share
        - I think that's a really great response you STUDENT I think equipment is one of the most important words in the question
        - so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what is one important word and that question STUDENT
        - Okay so STUDENT your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - I had a they did find craters full of water
        - But the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - But spending the money, building the equipment, and doing the research, do you think that it would be worth it? Is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for NASA to spend the money and do the research?
        - Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So who can tell me what is discover mean?
        - We're talking about discovering the water
        - The key words in the question where to discover the water
        - What did they use in that one, that one tool
        - that were discovered was the key word we were looking at
        - So they they said right in the question convincing evidence that means we're going to use right
        - But our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility
        - Our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable
        - Listen to the word, and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So you weren't convinced, but the question
        - It'll be a verb
        - Indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking
        - Yeah, this is going to be a lot of fun
        - So I first want to go over the question, the question that was asked was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Can somebody tell me what this question is looking for
        - Can I challenge your thinking, what is what is equipment mean do you do, you know,
        - Are we going to look to our friend
        - So again, where are we going to look for the answer
        - Are we going to look around the classroom
        - Where do you think we can find our answer STUDENT?
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use
        - I mean what equipment or Oliverice they are using to discover the water
        - Now, we need to figure out how they find it
        - But the question is asked her as to find what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water not observing the water
        - Um, but the question is asking you to find the equipment to discover the water
        - Not for the oxygen, right?
        - Okay, so first one off of the key words that are used to cope
        - Discover, yes, great this the word in the question and this is the action that we are looking for in the passage
        - Perfect that is exactly right and equipment can be some kind of  scientific tools
        - Yeah, great sometimes we look at the question
        - So did STUDENT circle the words in a question that was important to establish equipment
        - The word, but the question is talking about that is also an important a word
        - And if we look at an action
        - Excellent word in the question and it's the action, we are going to look for it
        - But how did they find that ice is the question
        - So I guess if we rewrite the question, what we would say
        - Is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine, it was still a piece of equipment right that they used
        - I was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that I was looking at is what goes on with equipment
        - That's a good point, that's definitely an important piece of the question
        - So we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use
        - So we're looking for the equipment used
        - In an equipment, like you said, STUDENT is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon, right
        - The particular equipment that they, the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment and scientists used to do what, what is the purpose of this equipment Oliver or STUDENT, can you go
        - Okay, so you have the equipment part, you know, that part is important, what action which which equipment
        - Right, what specific equipment
        - Did they use to discover water on the moon
        - So, although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text
        - This one is asking for us to see in the text, what tools were used
        - But when we're looking at our question
        - What exactly did NASA use?
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Well, so we're looking for what equipment
        - But we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon
        - They said something about investigating what did they used to investigate
        - So let's just say for this question
        - It says, What equipment do we know what equipment means
        - So they're asking what tool
        - Scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, it's kind of like a tool
        - And our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - So if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope
        - What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon, not which equipment was more important
        - But the question that I'm asking is what What piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different, um, they used a different source of equipment
        - So it's a different source of equipment
        - But the question was, um, what what equipment was used, so that they could find the water to begin with
        - Yes, the answer is yes
        - I'm the question, however, access to think about, um, is there convincing evidence
        - Can someone tell me what evidence means
        - What's the evidence mean
        - Yeah, it's still valuable, though, you're right, value can mean money to that value has a double meaning, but in this sense, the valuable in the question means
        - Is it a good resource and why
        - Is it a good resource that water on the moon
        - And if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable
        - The fact that water on the moon is being discovered
        - So now that we know these two things we know what we're looking for a while reading the text
        - So thank you for that
        - We know that we're looking specifically for equipment and the equipment is used to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you for answering the question
        - But STUDENT Do you remember what our key action word in our question was
        - discover great and STUDENT Do you know what another word for discover might be
        - Yes, exactly so discover means to find
        - Yeah, like whatever you think that was equipment to discover water
        - We have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment
        - Okay, so what is another what is another main word of this question
        - So what is another word this question, STUDENT
        - But there is another another word that I want to talk about it
        - What is the verb of this question
        - So now we have discover water and equipment
        - Okay, so thank you
        - Okay, so let's think about it
        - So now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon
        - The discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on
        - So was the tool that they use to discover the microscope, or was it maybe the Lunar Orbiter
        - So if we are trying to answer the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What part of the question, did you pull out as being the most important part
        - Jazmin and STUDENT What did you pull out as being the most important part of the question
        - So while we're working together
        - I want you to to you STUDENT to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced
        - So remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile
        - What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things
        - So we have equipment we have water we have discovered, we put STUDENT those things together
        - I think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you guys STUDENT said: equipment to discover water
        - So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water
        - Discover that might be a very important word too
        - okay so STUDENT is a circle of equipment and discover
        - So the first thing is, um,
        - Okay, well, you know, I think these words are going to really help us when we're looking
        - We're looking for this information in the test
        - But the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water
        - what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read, so I want to turn now to some of your responses
        - Okay, so friends let's think we STUDENT seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's A couple of words that I really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something?
        - So um, for example, if I was going to start if I wanted to discover a new element or a new planet STUDENT we've been learning, you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right So if I, what do you think that means?
        - yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something
        - I want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right, we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically
        - I want to focus on the word valuable specifically
        - so to be valuable is similar to what STUDENT said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways
        - But, did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why STUDENT circle, the Lunar orbiter the small machine
        - Right, the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water, the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water
        - Yes, I think equipment is a great word to circle
        - We're not asking how they got there, we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well, what equipment didt the scientists use?
        - Yes, exactly because equipment, again, that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find
        - And the water, of course, that is the object that they were, that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know
        - What equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said STUDENT is what they were looking for So yes, i'm also going to write your word down as well
        - Does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words?
        - Well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased
        - so when the Lunar orbiter actually got there
        - what was the question actually asking us to determine about this NASA mission?
        - Right so maybe there's not a lot of water
        - And now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water?
        - I want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment
        - So you gave really great responses to this question
        - So STUDENT, do you want to try answering that question for us, what does equipment mean
        - So these are tools, people can use
        - So STUDENT brought up a great point what equipment means
        - so before we dive into the question I want to ask one of you, what is your understanding of the word equipment, what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights
        - Right so who knows, just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about
        - You got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do
        - it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article
        - Well that's Okay, now we know that the question, the key word was the equipment,
        - Well, there you at the end of the paragraph, it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable
        - And maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's STUDENT about your opinions as long as you support it
        - Okay, so now we have STUDENT of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it
        - So our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon, which is how they found it at first, right?
        - But before we even look at the article again and start our discussion, what do you think are the I don't know, maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking
        - and I mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there, maybe one other yes STUDENT
        - kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon, and then you named it, I think that might be that might be
        - that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using
        - That helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer
        - In this context, it looks like the specific question you STUDENT identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so
        - Thank you, so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how Jazmin's
        - Alright, so what is it really asking for, what information does it want to know
        - Are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use?
        - that's true what kind of equipment, or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for
        - What is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place, what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death
        - Now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for
        - Okay, so let's talk about this Jazmin your answer was that NASA sent a small machine right, and I think we can STUDENT agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right
        - But, as you and STUDENT also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is
        - That is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment, which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down
        - And I want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water, so do we think that, looking at water and discovering water are the same, are they different
        - STUDENT right, i'm seeing some nods, so I think we're really onto something here, and I agree, I think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can Somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for
        - The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water
        - So something I want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and STUDENT you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so
        - I want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment, so what might be a synonym
        - A word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now
        - So we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now
        - And here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists
        - circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question, so we need to make sure that we identify a specific piece of equipment that scientists used, and then the equipment is used to discover water on the moon
        - So when we're answering this, we want to name the equipment and we want to make sure that it's used to find the water
        - yeah sorry about that, let me remind you, so what is another word that means the same thing as discover
        - but once again thinking back to the question itself, what do we want the specific equipment to do
        - With the word equipment, because that's what we're looking for right, we want to make sure we include a piece of equipment
        - And then Farrah to go to yours, I think that's also a key word because that's telling us the action that the equipment is doing so, we need a piece of equipment that's going to discover and to pull it all together STUDENT, we need to discover water right
        - So in our response we're going to look for a piece of equipment that specifically us to discover water
        - let's think back to the question right, what do we specifically want our equipment to do
        - Okay, so the question is asking us about discovering water on the moon, and where are we going to find the answer
        - Okay, good so if there's a question about maybe where or what is it asking us really
        - But the question right is about the purpose there's a specific kind of equipment right that the equipment, what are the equipment, help them do
        - When I discover something right did I know where it was before that
        - Okay, to discover right discover
        - Okay, for the first time right and is it always obvious like Oh, I know exactly where that is
        - Okay Jazmin I noticed that yeah so first of STUDENT, you on finding up the keyword discover is really great
        - which I think is an awesome keyword because, although discover and water are also great keywords
        - But remember how we circled we did circle equipment, but we also circled the world's water and discover so we're looking for pieces of equipment
        - Great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely
        - Does anyone want to talk about those keywords again who's got a key word for me STUDENT
        - yup STUDENT, do you think there are any other words in the question that you would circle, in addition to those
        - But I have a question for you so we're talking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT know what the word equipment is? or do we want to talk about that a little bit more?
        - Does STUDENT know what the word equipment is?
        - yeah STUDENT, what do you know about the word equipment?
        - yeah exactly so I brought a few examples, so if you were a baker some equipment that you might use would be a whisk
        - And if you were an artist, maybe some equipment, you would use would be a marker
        - So equipment is a tool that you use to do your job, and if you were a scientist, you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right?
        - Did STUDENT hear that we're looking for one piece of equipment
        - huh what can someone tell me what what is equipment, I was saying it's my mouse and keyboard and we were talking about our supplies, but what what is equipment to you
        - Okay, so um let's see I also wanted, before we begin, I really wanted to clarify that the word equipment means a necessary item that is used for a specific purpose, such as discovering water on the moon
        - because the question's asking what what equipment the scientists used and I want you STUDENT to find that in your response okay so go ahead and circle that
        - I want you to so i'm a little concerned that the question you need to answer is asking about the equipment, okay, so we really want to make sure that we can find that equipment in the text um
        - And so, for this question because we're talking about what scientists used to discover water
        - Sure, it was easy to find so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's what's the important word of that sentence, do you think
        - So what I would like to do is take a minute to think about the WHO and the what and the how so who do we need to focus on?
        - In this text and thinking about the question, who do we need to focus on? STUDENT
        - Sure, well let's let's think about it
        - So what does it mean to discover something?
        - So the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But do we know how they discovered and found the water is there a place in the reading where we know what Oliverice they used to find it
        - yeah so as far as we know, in the reading the tools that we have our microscopes and lunar orbiters and the question we're answering is which tool to the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - And so, based on this What could we guess what do we think what piece of information is this question asking us to find
        - but what are we looking for for this specific question?
        - We decided that we were looking for equipment that is used to discover water on the moon
        - yeah and so let's take a look at the question again, what is the question asking us to find
        - So what what do we think the question is asking
        - yeah so we're looking for equipment that you should discover water on the moon
        - do you think you can rephrase that question and put it in your own words
        - Great so what what is the question asking for, are they asking for um what was found on the moon, or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon, what do you think
        - yeah I agree, so I think that that's exactly what the question is asking it says what equipment, did they use
        - what are some key words
        - but i'm going to pick the one that STUDENT mentioned about equipment
        - So it looks like you STUDENT have come to the understanding that the question is asking what equipment did scientists use
        - can either you STUDENT tell me what discover means
        - because that's what the question is asking for it's asking for a piece of equipment STUDENT, did you have a question
        - great and so if we think about what we read in the text and we try to consider this word equipment that might give us a little clue for what we're looking for and so
        - STUDENT I really like how you found the word machine in the text because I find that that word machine is kind of similar to the word equipment
        - because I think of machines and equipment and in us in the same way, I think that those words are synonyms um
        - yeah that's very good Farrah so as you just said, you STUDENT are looking for the water, so if you go into the text and find the similar word to looking for or discover it's going to be investigate,
        - Oh that's interesting um do you think you understand the word investigate
        - investigate can be somewhat equivalent to discovery right
        - The equipment is used to discover water right?
        - that's I, and this is the thing about the question that we're going to get into, which is what is the wrong or right answer in this question because the question just kind of asked us about equipment right?
        - What equipment is used right?
        - And so, if we're thinking about equipment, what piece of equipment is used, based on the answer that you gave?
        - so and which equipment did they use?
        - Okay they're not in the story Okay, so this is a good, this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right
        - let's go back to the question, which is what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question right? so what part of those instructions kind of help you remember, oh I got to use the text or useful knowledge?
        - when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind STUDENT
        - So what does that mean in terms of what scientists are using to get water, what does the equipment mean def
        - so when we think about equipment and we know that scientists used equipment to get water off the moon, what does that mean to you
        - you're right no very good job and having it split, how can that help, how is that valuable
        - So I see from based off of our answers Farrah Oliver and Luis you guys STUDENT did a great job of understanding that you know from our question you know where we're looking for equipment
        - we're looking for specific equipment that will help us find one on the water right and Jazmin and Chris, I also noticed that you STUDENT did that to
        - Right good so using those keywords like using building alright, so we got two parts of their so STUDENT said
        - tools is another way that we can help us find the word and then Jazmin said that we're also going to look for clues like digging and building, so that we know that we're using the equipment right STUDENT else anything else
        - Okay, so how about I build off that again So what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using
        - STUDENT right, so in order to so we already have our background information, we know that we're looking for equipment or tools that's going to help us find water on the moon
        - so also build enough that remember the tool that we're looking for specifically it's supposed to find the water, you know it's supposed to help us collect the water search for the water, and so you STUDENT mentioned the cups
        - Good alright, so we see we have different pieces of the context of what we're trying to find here, so the main part of the question is what equipment, did they use to find the water
        - And it seems like there's almost two parts to this question right what tool was used and how was it used What did it do
        - so let's think about how does this answer the question about is it valuable, is it helpful right um
- intent: r410.3
  examples: |
        - Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon
        - yeah you you so maybe I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope Go ahead
        - STUDENT when we are asked to answer a question
        - It's very important that we go back in the text
        - We're back to number two
        - You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - There's where STUDENT found her answer, but the microscope was just to be able to see the water they found it
        - They would have to use a combination of STUDENT those things
        - But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use
        - And what we can do with the water once they found it
        - but they didn't say, full of water
        - You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting
        - A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon
        - I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested
        - I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading
        - but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon
        - So, that is right, STUDENT
        - They do need a lot of equipment to get there
        - But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process
        - You know, a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters
        - However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text
        - The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?
        - I just want to kind of add some detail to it
        - They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable
        - Yeah, they definitely need space suits to be in space, but I think they might have used a specific tool in the text to see if there is water on the moon
        - But what we're looking for is more of what's in the text
        - So talking about the microscope or the lunar
        - However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading
        - But in your answer
        - Does that make sense
        - I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon
        - But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon
        - And they definitely do need to use a microscope
        - Does that make sense
        - But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part
        - This did use a lot of equipment like you said what you use your background knowledge, instead of the evidence from the text that you were supposed to eat like I wanted
        - And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water
        - STUDENT, you had a great response
        - So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us
        - It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for
        - With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough
        - Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay
        - And based on your answer
        - STUDENT I remember in your response
        - Like STUDENT talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text
        - But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text
        - You, you talked about how they use equipment
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good
        - And STUDENT, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks
        - So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage
        - But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions
        - Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading
        - And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind
        - But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it
        - but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered
        - But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water
        - I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question
        - However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find
        - They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon
        - So we did use that, STUDENT
        - You're totally right about that one
        - That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like STUDENT, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic
        - But they never said they need to use a microscope
        - But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope
        - Okay, so let's start with you
        - STUDENT So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon
        - So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks
        - They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage
        - but I just -did you -this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used
        - So did you have questions about the passage?
        - I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely like did you did you have questions about it?
        - Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?
        - Because we want to make sure that when you are working
        - Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of
        - and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as STUDENT in this case
        - So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know
        - I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading
        - You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then
        - Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right
        - that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just
        - Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says
        - um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object
        - person it's really great job i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert
        - Does that make sense to you
        - I want to know that you understood the reading that we did
        - But I want to know
        - But I'm a little bit concerned that you're not finding the answers in the text
        - If you'd like to follow along with me
        - Teacher : But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks, but it does say in part number two
        - I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water
        - So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading
        - That's an important information and it's good to know what is a microscope, a microscope and but there is another equipment that they use in the beginning for this Discovery
        - Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it
        - Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question we focus on what we see in the reading
        - I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like STUDENT said is microscopic
        - I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned
        - That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon
        - You know there's actually very little water really on the moon
        - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text
        - but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,
        - or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth
        - I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye
        - That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it
        - It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water
        - that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?
        - So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,
        - right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it
        - but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water
        - You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it
        - That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters
        - On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope
        - when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size
        - but they didn't they didn't send a microscope up to space okay
        - So in this particular experiment they didn't send that they didn't have people go up
        - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage
        - Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so
        - Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters
        - So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four
        - So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention
        - One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about
- intent: r420.3
  examples: |
        - Can you and STUDENT work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?
        - and we're going to keep our eyes open
        - I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text STUDENT
        - so, can you look at the text STUDENT and see what the machine does
        - awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay STUDENT i'm ready for you
        - awesome well STUDENT I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis
        - At least here in this case so STUDENT and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment
        - So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys STUDENT circle one word
        - So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example STUDENT yeah
        - who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that STUDENT do you have a  question
        - So I want STUDENT to look in your text at paragraph two, yes
        - Okay STUDENT, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water
        - But let's look back
        - It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something
        - Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage
        - And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment
        - So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable
        - Can STUDENT look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be
        - So, STUDENT I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable
        - Can you do that
        - so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable
        - Can you go back in the text and look for specific equipment that they use
        - and maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water
        - So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?
        - Um, how can I say maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use
        - So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,
        - I think the article talks about being able to find water and
        - Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there
        - You have a question
        - So that's one of the great things that we can do, since we're in a class in a learning environment, we can use our skills to reread some articles and we can look back and we can try to find these details if you give me one moment STUDENT yes def
        - Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question
        - Once you try it
        - The first thing is to always find evidence in the text
        - And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that
        - Okay, STUDENT, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and
        - Can someone see what they brought
        - Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate
        - Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it
        - So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six
        - So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question
        - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine
        - When we find,
        - Yeah, the reading and the question
        - You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words
        - And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again
        - So, STUDENT right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read
        - So like this question
        - So go back to STUDENT the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,
        - This help discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so next time we need to read it again
        - Okay? So we understand clearly what are the tools that they are using and the equipment
        - Can we do that
        - I want you to underline two things and raise your hand
        - Once you're done
        - And if you want to amaze me
        - I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back
        - I want STUDENT to do that for me
        - So when we find evidence, what do we have to do with that evidence
        - Alright, start thinking about detectives
        - So we have to be detectives
        - There's an "I" word in the article, you find it?
        - But, and so when we have evidence
        - Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with
        - Let's see if you STUDENT can reread and find what
        - So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things
        - And he says,
        - What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together
        - STUDENT, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water
        - I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you
        - Go ahead and look back
        - So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that Jazmin aright, STUDENT and Oliveron
        - But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it
        - So you keep you look down and you read about the
        - I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does
        - Did you find so in the text
        - Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers
        - But look in your text STUDENT
        - And look, just a few more words
        - What did they call this small machine
        - Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource
        - So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water
        - specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water
        - Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about
        - You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water
        - Something they used
        - Although might have some other knowledge
        - Let's look at specifically at the reading
        - So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for
        - Maybe in one of the headings or sub headings
        - So look back on your article and look for that word valuable
        - Do you see it anywhere in there
        - Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon
        - Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?
        - Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space
        - But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water
        - Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it
        - Would you like to maybe give it another go
        - Scientists found on the moon
        - Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water
        - So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we STUDENT to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us
        - Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question
        - Well, I appreciate your honesty
        - So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question
        - So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment
        - Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is
        - What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
        - That is perfect
        - I love that synonym STUDENT, you are spot on
        - So if you STUDENT could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools
        - So I see a lot of hands going up
        - I'm going to give STUDENT a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see
        - Okay, I see some hands going up
        - STUDENT What equipment or tools did you find in the text?
        - And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon
        - I want you guys to first think about equipment or like STUDENT said tools that would be used
        - So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon
        - But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon
        - Oh, we've already get some ideas
        - Helmets and STUDENT the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon
        - Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools
        - STUDENT, what do you see what do you think?
        - So let's look back in the text
        - I want you STUDENT to focus on some key words
        - So I want you STUDENT to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words
        - To find water that's absolutely right
        - Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that
        - Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text
        - Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text
        - I want STUDENT to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph
        - All right, stop right there for me, STUDENT
        - And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover
        - Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph
        - Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick
        - Why don't the three of you go back together and Underline in the text important things that water can be used for the astronauts can use it for
        - Um, well, Farrah, Oliver and STUDENT
        - Now that we've kind of talked about the paragraphs that our information is in Jazmin found hers in four STUDENT found his in five
        - So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage
        - I'll give you about two minutes
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that
        - I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it
        - What is that
        - It tells you what we need to be able to see this
        - And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line
        - Now the next step
        - Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question
        - I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question
        - I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important
        - And while each of you had really good thought processes
        - Alright STUDENT so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion
        - So, STUDENT, if you would
        - And if you don't, what is mentioned
        - Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned
        - So I want you to look for that STUDENT look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon
        - I want you to find in the text where it talks about the water being so small that you have to use that kind of told hey
        - There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text
        - No if you remember back in the article
        - See STUDENT these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question
        - So let's look at paragraph two, and see what other tool we need
        - So you can talk about your background knowledge
        - I know that you understand what we're talking about
        - Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way
        - But in this particular text
        - So maybe next time
        - We're learning about one specific thing
        - If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay
        - Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me
        - So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them
        - So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water
        - Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question
        - But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place
        - or ask a question if you're confused and um because STUDENT also
        - and for your response STUDENT, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph
        - To see the exact equipment they used
        - You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used
        - Similar to STUDENT, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use,
        - If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers
        - So if you STUDENT are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text
        - So for the three of you Farrah Jazmin and STUDENT when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind
        - And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water
        - so STUDENT I want you to go back and look for anything that in the passage that the passage reads not any information that you know from outside just specifically in the passage that water can be valuable to us
        - So um that can be useful useful helpful something any kind of detail
        - But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage
        - So I want you to so as I just said to Farrah and to STUDENT of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful
        - drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence
        - STUDENT what's up
        - Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses
        - I want you to look at paragraph 2 again
        - Just pause for a second, I don't want you to read it, I want you to look at it and then try to interpret that into a sentence like STUDENT did
        - So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see in the reading - equipment listed
        - So when you look at paragraph two and three you're going to try to see keywords that may make a microscope and lunar orbiter two different types of equipment
        - Does that make sense? so why don't you do that for one minute
        - And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading
        - You had what they discovered, but can you help me
        - Look for examples of how they discovered it in the reading and you may use some examples that Jazmin or Farrah and STUDENT had but let's let's figure it out together
        - But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading STUDENT three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used
        - and try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay
        - Alright Farrah will STUDENT you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline
        - that's what that would be a good start so again my same suggestion, think about the question think of it in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline STUDENT of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading
        - Perfect STUDENT right now I want you to do the same thing and go back and do the reading again and I want you to pull out another one okay
        - I want you STUDENT to take 35 seconds, and I want you to reread the reading, but I want you, while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading Okay, and try and make it stuff that you haven't already talked about near responses okay
        - I want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay
        - In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer
        - so let's STUDENT look back at the reading and see if we can find any important clues that might tell us right away what the answer is
        - it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover
        - Alright, so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you STUDENT each a highlighter and you are going to be read the section
        - The second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable
        - And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does STUDENT have any questions before we start
        - So now i'm giving your highlighters you're going to go through those sex that section that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon STUDENT have any questions before we start that
        - yep so the microscope and the Lunar orbiter were definitely use, but I want you to go through the text yourself, and I want you to make sure that you can find yourself where that came from and what the evidence is to support that in the text
        - Yeah, next time that would be really great
        - You want to make sure that when you're reading a text, you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to it as possible
        - I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you STUDENT a minute to do that
        - STUDENT right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned
        - Can you find the sentence that Jazmin just talked about when it talks specifically about the Lunar Orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for STUDENT of you
        - I want you to read through the passage and just and see if you can find another example of an equipment that was before the microscope that helped us know that we even should be using a microscope to look very small bits of water
        - Can you do that for me
        - I also want you to be more of a detective and look to see if there's any other equipment that you see
        - You take your time you reread it, see if you want to add anything, because I think there might be other pieces of equipment too
        - Can you be a detective right now, and maybe find that tool for me
        - Can you go back and look to see if you see a specific equipment that's mentioned
        - If you're not sure what should I do you can do is go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name
        - So why don't you go back and reread the text to see if there's any way that having more space would be good
        - Now you can use the words you circled "equipment" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there
        - I think in the middle the passage
        - And so you can look carefully in the passage to see where is the equipment
        - You can take a carefully look
        - Okay, so I want you right now to reread the first or the article
        - Is that clear?
        - Reread article, and I want you to circle, any word that you might think is equipment
        - So why don't we try to combine those two answers
        - So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit
        - The scientists use in order to complete this mission
        - Let's revisit our text and figure out what specifically what equipment or scientific tool
        - Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and read for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon
        - but I, what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the text and look for specifically a piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the reading and read closely the part where they talk about
        - So I want you to go back and try and find that machine
        - Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - Because at first I will read something and we'll think will think it's a big crater, because it is a big crater, but then we'll have to talk about our thoughts of it
        - Yeah, that's why sometimes we have to talk about our thoughts
        - And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading
        - And we're going to make some annotations on our work
        - So today, what would I want you to underline is where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer
        - So that means we're going to underline things that we find
        - And think about if there were any other tools that were used
        - I'm going to have you look at this paragraph again
        - So we want to find what it says in the reading
        - Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question
        - I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer
        - Now that you've been able to add to your answer
        - So when you read your paragraph again I want you to think about what exactly this paragraph is talking about
        - Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different
        - For you STUDENT, what I want you to do is try again look at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that
        - So I think we need to do a little bit more digging into the reading and maybe we can look and see if it shows says anywhere in our reading what equipment was used
        - STUDENT and look and see if you see anything about equipment
        - So maybe you could go back in the text
        - So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text
        - You can go back in the text
        - Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that
        - And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were An equipment used to discover the water, let's take a minute because that is the question
        - When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question
        - And I love what you did with number two, but maybe you can do that with paragraph three, and maybe you can do it with paragraph one
        - So then I would love for you to go back to one and two
        - Look for cluse within the text that have a ding ding ding And I give you a signal for a scientific tool
        - So reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment
        - And it's okay for you to circle some words that might help
        - You can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two,
        - And see if you can find more tools at the scientists use
        - And find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or I guess I can help you
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        - STUDENT, so I want us to go back and reread the text, and I want you to look for the action where discover because I think that that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a minute to go back into the text
        - Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer
        - Oh, STUDENT, you're absolutely right
        - The word discover isn't here
        - But I want you to look
        - Actually, I'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for a discover
        - And a word that might have a similar meaning
        - And so I'm going to have you look back in paragraph two,
        - I want to see if we can identify  This this different equipment, because none of us wrote this for our answer
        - So we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the key words
        - In our question before we write our answers
        - Does that make sense, STUDENT
        - So I want you to go back and reread And look for the word valuable, it can be really helpful friends when we pick out a certain word in our question and we try to go back into our reading and find it in order to find the right answer
        - So I want us to go back in the text and look for the word valuable because that's one of the words that's in our question
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        - So I think the key to answering this question after looking at it and determining
        - That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource
        - So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability
        - So I want us to go back and into our reading and find more example
        - Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on
        - So I want us to go back into the text
        - I want us to look for examples explicitly stated examples in the text
        - Great guess that's definitely true, but I would like you STUDENT to reread paragraph two, and try to circle words equipment words that maybe that specific piece of equipment itself was what was used to discover the water okay
        - But, you know, something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles and these titles and subtitles can give you more information about about the main ideas of the text
        - Read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time
        - I'm going to give you STUDENT two minutes to read the text
        - Okay, so that's what I want you to think about when you go back into the text
        - Two minutes and read and just and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but I want a sentence for out of STUDENT for a revised answer
        - So I suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again
        - Can you do that for me
        - So go back to the checks and look for that
        - Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used
        - But I think I want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar Lunar Orbiter
        - Well, yes, STUDENT
        - Okay, so read a little bit more, and maybe take some time to underline some key words in your Texts
        - and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can
        - Okay STUDENT so in the text on do you um I so either i'm going to have you can you please read over the text, and try to find what that machine is called and then i'm going to if you have it right now
        - So maybe not literally looking very close at the reading, but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to
        - you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts, and we are looking for equipment, specifically, and I would like, for STUDENT to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly
        - i'd like for STUDENT to write down say two things
        - How much water they had too so STUDENT you can go back and then look at how much water their own says they have found I think they say that okay
        - could you STUDENT look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph
        - STUDENT i'm wondering if you to take another look because i'm hearing about some really interesting tools from your classmates
        - That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the
        - I would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery
        - Being an astronaut and you're, of course, they have to have oxygen tanks, so in this question or in this particular case, we want to try to use evidence from the text right so that's why I want to do I want you to take a second STUDENT
        - But we want to also find out how they find the water and circle, something that would let you know that okay
        - So what do you think I want you to dig a little bit deeper into the text, what do you think help them to get to the point where they could use the microscope
        - When you have the microscope there you're like okay Now I know exactly what i'm looking at right so, but we have to get to the moon
        - And then bring it in some right so again same direction as Farrah looking at text and see if you can find out how they were able to get it down narrowed the space down small enough to use the microscope STUDENT
        - yes ma'am I see your hand
        - I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific
        - hold on one second even and I noticed that STUDENT has to work on one specific thing, and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it
        - So what I like to do when i'm reading a scientific text is create a visual of what's going on, so I know that I have the moon, and have just told us that the moon has going to have a North Pole and a South pole
        - So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us
        - Great let's go back to our visualization
        - Yes, absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text
        - Here and underlined, a sentence where
        - and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon
        - So what you can do my feedback for you is that you could just read every time you read a passage and the questions given to you, I want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me
        - what's what's missing from here what's the information that's missing here
        - can we look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was
        - and maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable
        - yeah yeah look in the text and find find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable
        - You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money
        - so maybe you STUDENT can go with the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic
        - so I would want STUDENT of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery
        - Do you remember that part of the article I wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding
        - But I want you to really make sure that you're looking to answer the specific question so STUDENT if you can go back to the text, and I want you to really look very carefully
        - would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon
        - Okay, and when you find it go ahead and just circle circle what you think that's speaking to that Okay, and then
        - What the text is saying, but it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds
        - Use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words
        - Thank you, STUDENT
        - Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me
        - So i'm going to go back and check in with STUDENT about what he's working on it, will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about
        - To see what they see what they were looking for so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this the phrase that would help you make that connection between what the Lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph
        - So just go back and read the passage really quick
        - Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay STUDENT do you have a question
        - so go back to the text and see try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovering water on the moon
        - Fine yeah yeah so to find think about that general idea and see if you could find to go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover the not necessarily discover
        - Alright, so might be an option to look at right, but maybe I want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water amen
        - I want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it
        - so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two
        - so go ahead and underline The specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now
        - And not discovery process, so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it, but finding it in the first place
        - so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery
        - Is thinking specifically about how they discovered water on the moon
        - Looking specifically for that context that's a really great question STUDENT, thank you
        - astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space, so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using
        - Alright, so, And I should have said this when you're reading but let's try to look for tools in this paragraph
        - I want you to maybe take a minute, while I go speak to some of our other friends and see if you can look over the passage and see what equipment was mentioned in the passage
        - Alright, so I want you to think about that, while I go ahead and talk to my other friends and I want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage
        - Okay, maybe we can look at the text a little bit more, I think I saw a little bit of a clue it's a small machine and we can find that in the text can STUDENT look and see if they can find that sentence of the text, a small machine
        - so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two, to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay
        - So take a look at paragraph two, and see if you can find that tool
        - So my suggestion for both of you delve, too, is that you reread paragraph two, and maybe some of three and to really understand what tool is being used to first find the water before they use the microscope
        - so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two, there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works
        - Right, but if we really want to know how did they find it in the first place, there is another tool that we can look for in this in this New York Times passage there right and so actually for you and STUDENT
        - so let's take a look my suggestion, again, is that we take a look at this paragraph two, because there is there's another tool that was used in order to find the water, even before they could see it
        - um suggesting that water could be valuable, so my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph, for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason, maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful, even if it isn't right now
        - My suggestion is similar to Oliver and STUDENT you take a look at paragraph four, and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there
        - STUDENT You also spoke about paragraph five, so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find and why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship
        - Also right now Jazmin STUDENT reread paragraph four to find out why would it be better on the moon
        - Right and we haven't mentioned moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five, to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon
        - Because most of the articles about equipment that they used how they found it, so I would reread and do a little ranking and sorting of the evidence that I find
        - So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use
- intent: r130.2
  examples: |
        - awesome awesome okay Farrah and STUDENT will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks
        - STUDENT are you are you on board with that
        - now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes STUDENT
        - awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon? Yes, STUDENT
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead STUDENT
        - yeah and when you're done why don't you and STUDENT talk about Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people
        - yeah Farrah and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and STUDENT
        - So what investigate mean does STUDENT know
        - So did STUDENT say like a title?
        - What do astronauts use it for STUDENT
        - is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource STUDENT
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and STUDENT work together since you were you had the same answer
        - And you can talk about it
        - And I'm going to speak with STUDENT for a moment
        - STUDENT, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used
        - And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use
        - Did you circle, those two words
        - Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and Farrah and Oliver since you STUDENT had the same answer of microscope
        - I want you STUDENT to look back at your reading passage
        - and if you finish before I come back to you
        - Go ahead and work on the next question
        - I wonder, maybe STUDENT can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer
        - Farrah, would you agree with what STUDENT said?
        - So let's hop back to STUDENT for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question
        - So let's talk with STUDENT and see if we can work together on that one
        - Let's see if we can figure it out because STUDENT had the same answer is you
        - Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to Farrahs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can STUDENT support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay that's a great question
        - Okay STUDENT What do you think?
        - Okay, STUDENT else have a different answer than that
        - Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?
        - Jazmin, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with STUDENT, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry
        - Okay STUDENT are you able to help?
        - And how many of you STUDENT picked out equipment or discover
        - STUDENT what did you get
        - Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines
        - But STUDENT, did we know that ice is water right?q
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - You STUDENT look at that together
        - How about Oliver and STUDENT
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you STUDENT can help each other, look at the text
        - How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer
        - If you STUDENT want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three
        - So maybe Chris and STUDENT
        - I think that may help if you reread that okay
        - What do you think, Jazmin, what do you feel about what STUDENT said?
        - Um, to kind of build off that STUDENT
        - Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here
        - But what was the microscope attached to? Help STUDENT out
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, STUDENT, and I appreciate your feedback
        - So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?
        - Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and Oliver, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as STUDENT
        - Not really, but that's a good guess
        - STUDENT, what do you got?
        - I'm Question you
        - Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses
        - But we're still missing the point
        - What do you got?
        - Does anyone else have a different response than STUDENT
        - And then why your elbow partner agrees with you
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from STUDENT, and why you found what you found
        - Would STUDENT else like to build on his response
        - I want to see what you two can come up with together
        - Why don't Chris, you talk with STUDENT
        - Jazmin and STUDENT are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer
        - I would like for the four of you, and STUDENT can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with
        - So, Jazmin was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and STUDENT thought that they needed a microscope
        - So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers
        - To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, Luis Jazmin or Chris or STUDENT to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you
        - The Lunar Orbiter
        - What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you
        - So if you got the right answer
        - And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our STUDENT
        - What might help your friend
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think STUDENT
        - What do you think
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        - Maybe we'll discover it together
        - Let's work together to see if we can find this answer
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together
        - So let me see
        - Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together
        - and let's see STUDENT
        - They found craters full of water on the moon
        - Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement
        - so let's see who can add to that
        - So eventually I think should go along with what STUDENT said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - So you and Jazmin you and Luis work together and see if STUDENT can work to combine your answers and help each other out
        - So you think that you could work with STUDENT?
        - So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon
        - See if you can look in your text and you and Oliver can work together because you STUDENT are kind of on the same page too
        - And I'm sure that Farrah and STUDENT might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool
        - Do we agree with her answer
        - What could, Can somebody help STUDENT
        - Did we read about that
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out
        - STUDENT, can you help him out there?
        - can anybody or STUDENT
        - Can you tell me
        - Does the rest talk with STUDENT about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        - I think you have the answer
        - So, talk with STUDENT and help him discover which one it is
        - So what did STUDENT, you say about the water
        - So then STUDENT Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon
        - Do you want to answer
        - Okay, well let's ask your other classmates
        - So let's break it up into groups Farrah and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and STUDENT
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - STUDENT members, while the first person is sharing
        - So we're going to start with STUDENT, you will be our first person to share
        - You are just listening to them
        - Debbie will be the second Chris, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then STUDENT last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer
        - And then, STUDENT
        - So, STUDENT, if you will go first
        - I'll tell you when when to start
        - After that, okay, so you'll share with the group STUDENT
        - Let's see what they thought, and then maybe we can
        - So let's um let's talk to our the rest of our classmates
        - Also, do you have something else to say
        - Do you agree
        - Does anybody have anything else say thanks important or is STUDENT else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words
        - So I want you STUDENT to turn and talk and share and pair for about 30 seconds and look through there and see if you can find some places that Show through the text that water is a valuable resource
        - So, Oliveron STUDENT
        - You guys and Chris can work together and Jazmin and STUDENT You can work together
        - So just paragraph four or five and six
        - How about Farrah and STUDENT show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well
        - That's a claim that STUDENT said, right Luis?
        - Well, let me, let me ask STUDENT, a question, Jazmin, you mentioned that NASA sent a small machine
        - What kind of machine did NASA send? Maybe you can help STUDENT with that one
        - Okay so STUDENT You know a lot about space
        - Can you tell us what the Lunar Orbiter is?
        - So do you STUDENT think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon
        - What did the scientists, fine
        - And so what did that small machine do? STUDENT, can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did?
        - Okay, so STUDENT, can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does?
        - Does STUDENT else have another aspect, what they may have also sent with the astronauts
        - Okay, so, and Oliver did you agree with STUDENT
        - Okay, that's one type of equipment STUDENT else know about another type of equipment
        - Maybe, Farrah, do you think you can help out STUDENT?
        - So, based on what STUDENT just read about a lunar orbiter
        - Can anyone help Farrah, find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in STUDENT
        - So, do you know what paragraph or
        - But let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article
        - So what do you think about this STUDENT
        - Did you all hear what I said to STUDENT?
        - So does STUDENT else see any other equipment
        - Any other answers that it could that you possibly had that was related to
        - If you think something, it needs to be added to that answer
        - Thumbs up if you agree with STUDENT thumbs down
        - What do you think, do you agree with STUDENT or no
        - STUDENT else have a different answer
        - So we're, we're, we're stuck between microscope and lunar orbiter right
        - And then STUDENT was able to help push that answer a little bit further to identify the Lunar Orbiter
        - did STUDENT find a different word than equipment in question one
        - What's another keyword somebody else found
        - Somebody help STUDENT out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text
        - And I do like valuable, valuable is a good one
        - Convincing what? what are we being convinced of
        - Does STUDENT have a word to go along with savannas word convincing
        - Yeah so convincing is an important word
        - What is it convincing
        - Does STUDENT remember the name of that piece of equipment
        - So in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called NASA sent a piece of equipment up to space
        - So, Farrah and Oliver YouTube can talk Chris and STUDENT, you can talk
        - I would like for you to turn to the person beside you
        - Okay, now that you have circled your keywords
        - And then eighth and you can share your answer with me
        - I want you to talk to the person beside you about the words that you underline that you thought were important to help you answer this question to go ahead and take 15 seconds to do that
        - I want you STUDENT to talk about with that same partner,
        - So, Farrah and Deb, you talk together Chris and Jazmin, you talk and then STUDENT You can you can talk with me
        - So I want you to take a couple seconds and talk to the person but Sachi
        - So, STUDENT and Deb, you can work together
        - Chris and gel together and STUDENT You can work with me
        - Okay, so take a couple seconds
        - Okay, so equipment and discover did STUDENT else underlying equipment
        - So you can have what we talked with Farrah, and STUDENT here, right, which, if you don't mind
        - So STUDENT, do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes?
        - Your answer was that NASA send a small machine
        - Does anyone agree or disagree with STUDENT
        - You believe you don't need any help? Well, we're going to work through this together and we'll actually see what we can learn along the way
        - Does STUDENT else have any questions before we begin?
        - STUDENT, what you got to add?
        - We're not entirely there just yet
        - Well, we are absolutely on the right track
        - STUDENT, what do you have to add?
        - Okay, so I think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the group and kind of talk about where you STUDENT got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about
        - Okay, well let's see what Chris and STUDENT thought as well
        - Okay, that's a really good thought
        - STUDENT, would you like to go next
        - I want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what STUDENT thinks about your key terms
        - And so let's hear from STUDENT and see what he has to say
        - And we'll come together with a STUDENT response
        - You can ask me, but this is what I want you STUDENT to focus on
        - I want you STUDENT to break up into small groups so Farrah Oliver and Chris and then maybe Jazmin and Luis If you guys will work together for just a little bit
        - And if you have questions while you're discussing
        - Well, I know that a couple of you STUDENT had your hand raised
        - Since you STUDENT may have similar answers
        - But Chris, would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help STUDENT with his words
        - If you can split water up into two elements, like you said, how can you and Mr STUDENT that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for
        - By using what you and Mr STUDENT and Mr Chris, you can talk to
        - STUDENT and see how good your response and Luis just wanted to work together to help astronauts
        - Oh, I think it takes, can someone find it
        - Now, now you STUDENT have not, but you guys were so close
        - So have Mr STUDENT and history
        - STUDENT out death
        - So what other kinds of equipment would you STUDENT say that you would need to find water on the moon, other than a microscope
        - Does anybody have any ideas, STUDENT
        - So we have a microscope
        - Did STUDENT else see anything else in the text that you might use
        - So now we know they have
        - STUDENT you remember what I tools the scientist used?
        - Is there somebody STUDENT, would you like to help her out
        - Can you tell me the other item that they needed
        - Okay, so let's continue to look maybe STUDENT can help you out
        - STUDENT, Do you want to try to help her out to
        - Does STUDENT know what they use you either the hydrogen oxygen for within the water?
        - I had a really good answer um well I I brought you STUDENT, all together, because you guys all had varying answers so i'm hoping that when you guys hear your responses like your classmates responses
        - You can get ideas for them as well, because even the smartest people in the world, work with other people to make things better, because if you can collaborate, then you guys STUDENT learn at the same time
        - And maybe from listening to your classmates you might see in the text and see new things and learn from what is really happening, along with what you have found in prior knowledge okay you then so let's listen to our classmates STUDENT right
        - so maybe as we keep listening, as you heard from Jazmin and we might hear from Oliveron STUDENT
        - Okay well that's great why don't we go to her and asked her about cars and we'll come back to you to see if there's anything more you can add afterwards okay
        - so STUDENT is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and, if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add
        - Now Chris, now that we've heard STUDENT else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon
        - Oliver, let's have STUDENT look first before you share
        - Anyone besides-- anyone else? STUDENT, what did you come up with?
        - Good job for knowing the answer
        - Anyone else want to try? STUDENT, do you want to go? Yeah, go ahead
        - I want- before we get into that I want STUDENT else to share any other equipment they may have circled
        - STUDENT else anyone else have any guesses?
        - So I want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with Farrah and STUDENT
        - And then Chris Jazmin STUDENT are going to work together, and I want you to compare and contrast the difference between the Lunar orbiter and microscope
        - I want you to do this with a with a small STUDENT
        - So Farrah and Oliver can do it together and Chris Jazmin Luis can also be a small STUDENT, and I want you to circle any equipment, you see, in the reading, that you think is important, and then I want you come back in one minute
        - i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now, I just want you to collaborate with your peers because they STUDENT have different answers then you
        - So I want you to collaborate with them, okay? Thank you for the question
        - Do you guys know what did NASA send to help investigate STUDENT
        - Does anybody in the STUDENT remember reading about what they use to find the craters
        - Do you want to add STUDENT, what was the equipment that you had said that may be Luis's thinking about?
        - Does anybody want to help out STUDENT and tell him what the lunar orbiter was
        - STUDENT What do you think, do you agree with death
        - Does STUDENT else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right
        - Well, I think you're thinking could benefit STUDENT else and how you just does everybody
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT
        - STUDENT What do you think
        - So, STUDENT, what do you think
        - Can STUDENT help him?
        - Think about what's STUDENT said
        - Can STUDENT help him
        - um to make this a little easier did STUDENT have any answers that were different from savannas
        - let's see STUDENT did you have anything different today
        - who can raise their hand and what isn't it
        - That Luis didn't say, how about STUDENT
        - What did what equipment and I use
        - For the next for the next person who answers
        - Who agrees with STUDENT who agrees that the lunar orbiter was a tool that the scientists use
        - Does STUDENT else have any ideas about tools?
        - Does STUDENT else want to say something real quick
        - What about STUDENT, what do you think about that
        - That's a good idea
        - No thought, STUDENT, did you wanna chime in on anything
        - Let me see Does STUDENT want to help her out or point to where it was in the article
        - Let me see who else I
        - or yeah yeah okay great does anyone else, want to add anything, maybe Jazmin or STUDENT
        - About STUDENT can you read yours, and then we can maybe like a grief, we wanted to add something to it, or maybe take something away Okay, so I
        - drink this water does STUDENT else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing
        - So do you STUDENT agree that that can be very valuable
        - do you agree with Farrah do you want to add anything or take anything away from it STUDENT
        - STUDENT, can you help us out a little bit? I see you raising your hand
        - or STUDENT, do you have any suggestions
        - Did anybody else think that while they're reading or see that in the text? STUDENT?
        - All right, so Farrah and deb why don't you guys work together, while I finish up with everyone else, and you guys can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence, yes STUDENT
        - Who agrees with STUDENT that you do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        - Well let's look who knows what a lunar STUDENT do you know what a lunar orbiter is?
        - Okay, who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is?
        - STUDENT, do you agree with that
        - Does anybody want to-- STUDENT, do you want some help from a friend?
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT out? Why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable?
        - STUDENT, what do you think?
        - Very good, very good
        - Um, so can you go, or can you turn and asked help from a friend
        - All right, who agrees with Jazmin or STUDENT, do you have something to say
        - that's a really good reason, we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did STUDENT else have any other ideas
        - Does STUDENT want to jump in?
        - Okay, so you still think that that anyone else that has STUDENT else's opinion stayed the same, or have they changed
        - Does STUDENT else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text
        - Actually Farrah and STUDENT I think we're going to work together
        - STUDENT Are you are you with me
        - Does anybody want to help STUDENT make answer stronger
        - Do people think that
        - What do people think
        - Scientists use the microscope to discover water
        - Do people think it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Do you agree or disagree
        - What do you think, do you agree with STUDENT endeavor
        - Do you agree with Jazmin and STUDENT Why
        - Do you thin they used the microscope
        - Do you think that they used the lunar orbiter? Why or why not?
        - What do you STUDENT think the answer is, then
        - What do you STUDENT think
        - Um, what do you guys think about what STUDENT said
        - Do you agree with her thinking, Do you disagree with her thinking why oh
        - STUDENT, make sure that we're raising her hand
        - What do we think
        - Does STUDENT want to add some more detail
        - STUDENT, thank you for raising your hand
        - Do we agree or disagree with STUDENT
        - Why, raise your hand
        - Would STUDENT like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is
        - How did that help them to do this work, STUDENT
        - Did anybody else use a strategy, similar to STUDENT or differently to Jazmin, and how did it help them or how did it
        - But except for this Equipment
        - Can you, can somebody share what is another word that you found that is also important in the question
        - So, Farrah, and STUDENT, how about you two work together and talking to each other
        - And I'm going to work with other three students in a few minutes
        - How about you, you maybe help us later to help out out Chris and STUDENT to answer the question, because your answer is NASA sent a small machine, right
        - So if you are going to revise your answer
        - It may help Chris and STUDENT to understand better
        - You had equipment and anyone else in the STUDENT have equipment
        - Alright, so what I would like us to do next is Oliver Farrah and Luis I would like to group with you together and Chris and STUDENT, we're gonna work together
        - So you can start working in your small groups
        - Do you agree with STUDENT
        - What did STUDENT, say, what does it mean
        - You learn the word orbit and STUDENT
        - Luis is STUDENT right
        - To someone want to try to put that into one answer
        - Did STUDENT want to add anything to that I can
        - I still see a hand STUDENT
        - Does STUDENT have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment
        - And once you're done, you can share with the partner, partner next to you
        - See if you STUDENT got the same answers
        - STUDENT else find any other piece of equipment
        - You can take a minute to talk with the person next to you and revisit what that process was like, and then we can share out loud
        - Do you STUDENT agree nod your head yes if you agree to that strategy
        - What do we think folks?
        - nod your head yes if you feel like that is the equipment that they used
        - Does that make sense
        - Okay, can you help them out
        - You STUDENT, what part in
        - So looking at the reading There's another machine that the scientists use did STUDENT remember what that other machine that they used
        - Who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for
        - And what you're going to do is you're going to walk answers
        - So you're going to share each other's answers
        - So what I'm going to ask you STUDENT to do now is, you're going to turn to your partner
        - So let's say Farrah, if you are working with STUDENT
        - You two would share your answers with each other
        - I'm going to go to each STUDENT individually, and we're going to discuss your answers a little bit
        - So as you're working
        - And then I'm going to go to each of you individually
        - Okay, so go ahead and get started
        - Does STUDENT agree
        - That's what I think
        - Do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon
        - STUDENT and can someone remind me
        - Does STUDENT remember
        - Yes, that's a very good point as well
        - Does anyone else have an idea, why do we STUDENT have different answers
        - I can see why you think that, but I don't see it that way
        - We're going to break apart
        - So for the remainder of STUDENT we're going to break apart into groups or into part with you
        - Jazmin and STUDENT work together
        - Oliver in STUDENT then work together
        - So you're going to share what you found with Chris and I'm going to work with Oliver independently, STUDENT you have a question
        - You STUDENT have until six o'clock to work with your partner
        - STUDENT, you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now
        - Oliver and STUDENT should be working together
        - You agree with that
        - Did anyone have a different answer than STUDENT
        - Does anyone did anyone else find other examples, STUDENT
        - Luis gave an example, STUDENT, do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts
        - Um, I want us to go back in and answer our question again
        - So does STUDENT have another example that we could use of
        - And if you would like to add on to why you agree or if you have another quote from the text
        - If you agree can raise your hand
        - Does anyone agree with STUDENT
        - Would anybody else like to add on Oliver Chris or STUDENT to the first question
        - Does STUDENT else have an answer that they would like to contribute
        - Luis Would you like to help STUDENT
        - You too can work together to figure out how the scientists got the sample
        - Does anybody agree with STUDENT about evidence or does somebody have a different idea
        - Does STUDENT remember what it's called
        - Can we, can someone remind me of that
        - Or if someone else wants to tell me something different
        - I'm just gonna pull everybody in the STUDENT and see if we're on the same page
        - STUDENT, go ahead
        - STUDENT, what you think
        - I'm sorry to just call on you out of the blue, but, um, I think it's important to get everyone's input, so we can STUDENT be on the same page
        - Okay, thank you for giving your answer
        - We can have different answers
        - I like that, too
        - I like that
        - So, so we'll consider water as well and STUDENT, what do you have
        - So you could say they discovered the water, let's bring this to a consensus, I think only have like 30 seconds or a minute left
        - So to wrap this STUDENT up
        - And we use the information we we went back and discovered
        - It's important that we're on the same page
        - Did STUDENT circle anything different
        - awesome why don't you talk with Jazmin and you STUDENT can figure out if that
        - does STUDENT can anyone else, help and let us know what different form water might be in on the moon, rather than liquid like it like we might expect okay how about
        - No does STUDENT can answer the how much water they found
        - mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if anyone can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission, other than a microscope that we just heard Oliver and Farrah talk about a little bit yeah STUDENT
        - So how to do that Jazmin either you can answer, or maybe Chris or STUDENT could help you out with that
        - yeahm did STUDENT else find something else that they thought was interesting
        - Does STUDENT else think they could answer Farrah's question?
        - Does that shift anyone else's thinking about their response to here STUDENT explaining where he found that in the text?
        - STUDENT is there anything else you would want to add to Luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question?
        - does STUDENT else, want to add on to what the word equipment means
        - Does STUDENT else have any other ideas about what equipment is
        - um Chris, you have your hand raised earlier, do you want to maybe add on to what Farrah and STUDENT have shared so far
        - Farrah, is it okay if STUDENT helps you out this question?
        - Oliver you started out the same answer as STUDENT, do you agree with what you said you want to add on?
        - STUDENT we haven't heard from you, since the beginning
        - Maybe let's come back to STUDENT
        - can do you think you could answer Oliver's question? How would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon
        - So  what does everyone else think, do you STUDENT agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed In order to discover water on the moon, or do you disagree and might think it's something else?
        - The scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at  At the finding water on the moon, is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text, and when you answer I want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer
        - Okay well i'm going to toss it back to the team is her answer wrong, and if it is explained why with evidence from the text
        - and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right
        - Or would you go with your first answer
        - So Chris is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does anybody have a suggestion for what Chris to do next, STUDENT?
        - So, can you help us move our thinking forward what is something STUDENT to do to confirm his thinking
        - And the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first, and I want you to share with your partner, the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text, this time around, and if it changed tell your partner, why STUDENT right go
        - or actually Farrah um, do you agree with STUDENT that
        - OK Can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and NASA use
        - STUDENT um How does that sound to you, what do you think
        - and then STUDENT you're going to build
        - Okay STUDENT, can you build
        - Thank you STUDENT for sharing your thought process
        - Do other students in the STUDENT agree, disagree, want to push back? Feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard
        - Do you agree with STUDENT that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate?
        - Let's see STUDENT, I haven't heard from you today
        - Thank you STUDENT for sharing your thought processes
        - Also, yes, you are so right can STUDENT help right what is that machine call that NASA
        - Is there anything else they'd need to find that water
        - Did STUDENT find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool?
        - So I just want to zero back in on a different part of the story
        - now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said, and we can come to the closest answer so STUDENT, can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer
        - And then, as a STUDENT, we can have a discussion to find out what we can vote, you can vote amongst each other, what do you think the correct answer is, and, as a group, you can decide, and let me know
        - yeah great STUDENT Luis do you have any thoughts I know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic, do you have any comments to share on top of the Chris, because you can add on to this
        - As we were talking, did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too? Does that sound familiar
        - STUDENT our space expert Can you help us out
        - Well, your answer is not wrong STUDENT and i'm so i'm so glad that you picked to the microscope so I let as a way to answer your question, I would like one of your classmates to maybe kind of give us kind of a reassessment of how was it that that NASA made this discovery
        - STUDENT could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon, is still too early for Chris's goals
        - Does STUDENT have any other ideas about what equipment, the scientists use? do we
        - full of water, would you like to discuss this statement, whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect?
        - like how you define what it is microscopic
        - would you want to think deeply about that or maybe
        - Talk to Dave about it in the meanwhile STUDENT can answer because chip, it seems like Dave also so called the same thing as us
        - that's a very good observation would anyone else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what STUDENT just said?
        - What do you guys think that does it sound like a good enough explanation, Farrah and STUDENT?
        - let's see if we can reset refine your answer further
        - Who okay let's figure out if it needs further refinement and I think Oliver you also answered the same as Farrah, so why don't you the three Farrah, Oliver and STUDENT have a quick chat with each other
        - So you have like a quick moment to have a chat with each other and then share like Maybe you can reach a conclusion about the quantity of the water on the moon
        - Okay um would STUDENT, like to add to the response further would anyone like to even further refine savannas response
        - let's see if STUDENT has anything different to say
        - Okay, so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today, but I would in the in the meanwhile, I just want you to listen to why Chris and STUDENT have made some differences to the benefits of this
        - Based on what evidence, you have been able to collect Is there anyone else would like to add to the response that STUDENT has made
        - Does STUDENT think that lunar orbiter might be the right answer or might be the piece of equipment that was needed in order to find the water on the moon?
        - Farrah can you help STUDENT out?
        - I know that food is pretty gross I want to bring you into Congress and you should with STUDENT because Chris raised a good point in his
        - Oliver and Farrah can the three of you chat for a minute and share, about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then Jazmin and STUDENT can you do that as well
        - STUDENT I think you talked about a small machine, do you want to add anything here
        - anyone else were you able to see even from hearing what STUDENT shared and even from going back into the passage, we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the
        - equipment and what else, STUDENT can you help out
        - What kind of equipment does it want to know about
        - Chris, do you want to jump in? How about Farrah and STUDENT? What's it asking for, it's asking for equipment for discovering water, what else is it asking for
        - did STUDENT else have a different tool that the scientists used?
        - All right does STUDENT else have any other ideas about tools that NASA might have used
        - So, if we take a step further, to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph? STUDENT
        - so could STUDENT tell me what is the action in this question
        - so um did anyone have a different answer from STUDENT,
        - did anyone circle something different STUDENT
        - um what else could they have used, I think that somebody else yes STUDENT
        - and it doesn't have to be STUDENT somebody else can help her out if you want just find the line in the text that says that NASA sent a small machine
        - yeah that's fair does anybody have have some input for Oliver as to why the small machine is also important STUDENT
        - Absolutely STUDENT, do you want to clarify that
        - yeah does STUDENT know when they use it, based on the text we can look in part three
        - does STUDENT can anyone summarize what those two machines were Oliver, I think you just had it would anyone else, like to build on that
        - Thank you for sharing back does anyone have a different answer than STUDENT
        - Does anyone have a different feeling about that answer, do you think the Jazmin has included everything she needs to she talked about the WHO or anything else STUDENT?
        - What do you STUDENT think? Do you think that that strengthens Jazmin's answer?
        - What else do you think are important tools that allow them to look at water
        - what else how are they traveling to the moon
        - Anything else that we have
        - yeah in the story was there a part that maybe some one of your peers can help you find it
        - Maybe someone else could offer something yeah STUDENT
        - Maybe someone else can offer something
        - Well, what do other people think does anyone else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope Is it the Lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah STUDENT
        - What does STUDENT else think
        - Do people or agree or disagree with what STUDENT just said that the Lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah
        - yeah so thank you did STUDENT else circle equipment also
        - so did STUDENT else circle discover
        - yeah So what does STUDENT else think do we agree with what Farrah and Oliver said, do we have a different answer what does everyone think
        - mm hmm so let's let's let's ask the rest of the STUDENT
        - but STUDENT what else, are you going to add?
        - did STUDENT else identify that as a tool in this paragraph
        - Can someone rephrase what STUDENT just said, what does the Lunar lunar orbiter do
        - yeah so So what does STUDENT else think what do we think the Lunar orbiter is doing
        - What does everyone else think do they agree with what STUDENT said
        - Okay, so does STUDENT else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now, what do I think after the conversation
        - Alright perfect now I am going to have Dave and STUDENT partner up and talk to each other about what you were just thinking about
        - Jazmin and Luis I want you to partner up and do the same and STUDENT, you and I are going to spend some time together and be partners for today
        - Okay, can you give me just one, second, while I talked to Oliver and Farrah maybe you and STUDENT can talk about why you chose your answers and what you think is different between your answers
        - does STUDENT have any other ideas on where we might
        - want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use STUDENT
        - um, what do you, what do you STUDENT think
        - and at the same time I want, i'm wondering, is there any one else have different answers?
        - Does STUDENT has some different ideas to add them
        - Does STUDENT have more to add on to this question
        - So right now I want Chris deaf and Farrah to turn and talk to your partner and Jazmin and STUDENT will turn and talk with each other and you're going to answer does your response connect to the context of the question, go ahead and do that for 10 seconds
        - STUDENT, do you agree that NASA use a small machine
        - and actually STUDENT had a good point and his answer Chris, if you want to share
        - Good good STUDENT you want to build off that
        - Right good good STUDENT have a different answer
        - So what I want to do now is split you guys into two small groups so i'm just going to do STUDENT and death
        - I mean, excuse me i'm gonna do Farrah and death and then Chris STUDENT eat less or two groups so YouTube and then the other three
        - STUDENT and you want to build on that?
        - cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page So then, and then, did you have a similar answers to STUDENT or something different
        - so let's build on that, how can we build on that a little bit more?
- intent: r110.4
  examples: |
        - that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine
        - nailed it yes STUDENT high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great
        - Totally You got it
        - Equipment is a great word
        - Did STUDENT else put equipment
        - So that is a great word to underline, did STUDENT else underline anything else
        - So we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good
        - Those are both very important
        - So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?
        - That is exactly right
        - And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So STUDENT, I want you to think
        - That's absolutely right
        - So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Right, you use it to look at the water
        - Once they found it
        - It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - They did send a small machine
        - Okay, STUDENT, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine
        - Yes, they did
        - You two are correct
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - So you are right there
        - And I'm but yes you are
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - Just those two pieces of equipment
        - It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it
        - They did find water on the moon
        - SO let's look there
        - Yeah you STUDENT
        - That is correct
        - That is exactly right
        - That is the small machine
        - I think a lunar orbiter is really key here
        - Without that sort of orbiter right
        - They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon
        - That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and
        - All right, STUDENT, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater
        - You did very well
        - That's how they actually examine the water and the craters
        - It's the Lunar Orbiter
        - They could breathe it
        - Yeah, so when you find something for the very first time
        - Yes equipment is one of the terms equipment STUDENT
        - So it is very valuable and you guys are STUDENT giving me good answers on that
        - Yes, and you need water to survive
        - Yes, you're right
        - Those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon
        - Okay? NASA sent a small machine
        - You are exactly right
        - And you're right we so we do need that
        - Yeah, it's the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yes, those are important as well
        - So moving forward, yeah that's that's very important
        - I know what I mean
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - and you put it out perfectly
        - It could be useful in lots of ways
        - So it could be very important
        - So that's what they used to investigate what were they investigating
        - So what they use was the Moon, lunar orbiter
        - Your rights right so if there was water on the moon, it would be valuable
        - STUDENT you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore
        - So why don't you go ahead and circle that and then I'm going to come back to you in just a moment
        - Let me hear from STUDENT Chris, what were you gonna say
        - OK, so the machine was the Lunar Orbiter
        - So they had to discover it first, before they could use the microphone
        - Yeah, so that's that's the small machine
        - It's discovering water on the moon
        - So NASA see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter
        - Okay, so it looked for ice deposits in a large
        - So they were really small
        - That is excellent
        - Yes, the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon
        - Absolutely Equipment they used to discover the water
        - That's exactly right
        - Yeah, so that's a great example of equipment
        - Yeah, a lunar orbiter
        - So you're absolutely right
        - No, you're right
        - I think you, you're absolutely right
        - It is find water
        - So we can use water as rocket fuel
        - Right, so we have water we have rocket fuel
        - I do believe that that is a correct answer
        - So, good job there,
        - Yes, NASA used a small machine
        - that would also count as a piece of equipment
        - So they do use that kind of equipment on the moon to breathe, like you said
        - So I heard a few of you STUDENT say that you underlined a lunar orbiter and small machine
        - They do need oxygen
        - That is true
        - so STUDENT you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Very good, very good
        - Yes, there was a small amount of water that they found
        - They actually use that to find it
        - So you're right
        - They do need a small machine and,
        - I just mentioned with STUDENT right that water is heavy
        - Exactly and STUDENT, you got you got to that part
        - This is the
        - That's what we were looking for
        - Alright, so, STUDENT was back in the story, and she found that the other tool is called a lunar orbiter
        - So, so he's a lunar orbiter and a microscope in order to find water on the moon
        - Alright so next time
        - yeah that's right water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen
        - right there you go Oliveron or STUDENT
        - Yes, which you did, so awesome
        - amazing that is just what I was looking for
        - I like how you said that and is um and it's obviously super important there be able to breathe and then um
        - awesome that is so so good, that is what I wanted you to look for
        - Which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the Lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome
        - So that is the equipment
        - Yeah, that's what I was looking for your perfect
        - I think you've convinced me
        - Yes, that's a great example STUDENT, thank you for explaining that to us
        - Yes, that's a great example, thank you STUDENT for that
        - Yeah, there you go
        - and it's the Lunar orbiter is a small machine and
        - It definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter
        - So there are a few different answers that you could have, but the lunar orbiter is definitely one of the answers that you could have,
        - So great job
        - The equipment was used to find water on the moon
        - So yes, that is one of the answers to that
        - yeah that is correct
        - I think so to water is a super valuable resource wherever you go
        - So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter
        - That was a perfect response
        - Great job, STUDENT
        - Great job, STUDENT
        - Yeah, so they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, NASA sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon
        - We already had the Lunar orbiter part
        - To find water on the moon, and because
        - Again STUDENT kind of touched on it and her answer
        - To look at the water
        - Definitely, the Lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the Lunar orbiter in our answer
        - So that was a small machine that they use to investigate the moon to look into the large polar craters
        - So scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon
        - So you have the lunar
        - Thank you for sharing STUDENT, so the water was found in this craters
        - Okay, great, great job
        - Yes, you are right
        - So the small machine is the lunar
        - STUDENT right, the lunor orbiter
        - Yes, you are right
        - So the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens
        - STUDENT So the Lunar Orbiter
        - Nice work, STUDENT
        - That's exactly right
        - They still had to use it
        - Yeah, look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Nice job, STUDENT
        - That's the equipment that they used to discover the water on the moon
        - Yeah, that's absolutely correct
        - So the lunar orbiter is what was used, so that the scientists could discover that that water
        - Yeah, that's exactly right, STUDENT
        - Let's be kind to our friends, that's really not the way we treat each other in the classroom
        - So, um, you're right
        - STUDENT It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - You're off to a good start, like how you said he's a word from the story
        - I agree, it is very that is an important word to pay attention to equipment is
        - Thank you for that answer
        - I think equipment is an important word to focus on in
        - Thank you STUDENT for contributing that and for answering my question
        - That's the answer that I was looking for
        - There is there is something new for us
        - We didn't know that we can get water on the moon
        - Yeah, you are correct
        - Thank you for for responding
        - Yeah definitely is very important
        - Or good STUDENT I like that it's out prefer if you raise your hand so we can keep that same routine gone but thank you
        - So, good job
        - I think we're getting to the right place
        - Thank you for letting me
        - And what I heard from you STUDENT is that they used a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - yeah they definitely used the Lunar orbiter um to find the source of the water um so I wanted to talk to um
        - So the answer for STUDENT was correct one right
        - Yes I think we today, you need to see microscope, so it is very small amount they found the water or I think
        - Oh that's a great answer STUDENT
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right, it does look like it's a lunar orbiter
        - that's correct that's correct very good STUDENT
        - Exactly yeah it's called a lunar orbiter
        - yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools
        - yeah the small machine is one of the pieces of equipment that they use
        - yeah lunar orbiter so that's one piece of equipment great
        - Yeah, but you know it
        - Yes, the ice is so small
        - what do you want to add?
        - yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters, the keyword,
        - I think you're right, I think you do,
        - I like that, so they sent a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Great so we know that we're looking for a piece of equipment to answer this question now the next question that I want us to ask right we've just asked what kind of answer do we need
        - Okay equipment to discover water and STUDENT
        - Oh awesome everyone pulled out really interesting words, but I want to highlight Jazmin Luis and Oliver I think STUDENT were spot on
        - equipment whoa that's really great
        - lunar orbiter whoa that's really great yeah it's the name of the equipment
        - equipment and discover or two great words
        - awesome okay yeah I know you were on your way so let's see so now what now that we know so scientists found ice using a lunar orbiter cool
        - that's right, so we have the name of the Lunar orbiter
        - Yes, you're right the scientists were the WHO,
        - that's perfect Thank you Jazmin, so I think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what Jazmin just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question STUDENT or maybe something you want to add
        - No that's a great point STUDENT I don't think you're wrong if you don't say that because, like you said it's not mentioned in the text
        - I think that STUDENT just identified one of the reasons why Water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future
        - yeah absolutely you're right um NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job
        - Yes, that's why they need the microscope very good STUDENT right
        - Yes, very good that's a good answer the Lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate, but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut, yes
        - You are correct STUDENT it does mean really, really small
- intent: r210.4
  examples: |
        - Do you remember what they called that machine science has STUDENT sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?
        - yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know
        - I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?
        - yeah and what does the machine call
        - tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in
        - And what form so so, is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't
        - What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came
        - That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment, but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right
        - did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water
        - awesome STUDENT and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.
        - awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon
        - yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that
        - yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do STUDENT what is the machine doing
        - They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it
        - So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right
        - So what does that small machine have a name does STUDENT anybody circle what that small machine is called
        - So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together
        - So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you STUDENT want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?
        - And while I'm reading, we are looking for
        - We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you
        - So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay
        - So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - If you were looking straight at it
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely
        - So what is that microscope, helping them do STUDENT
        - So what is the name of that machine called?
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So let's look back and see if we can find it
        - Because it's in our passage
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So let's read the sentence
        - But let's look back and see what that's called
        - Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Yes, the small machine
        - Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?
        - Does STUDENT know what discover means?
        - So you have to find the water before you can look at it right
        - Before we can look at it
        - And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it
        - Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first
        - Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water
        - If we look at number two
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?
        - Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text
        - What equipment did they use?
        - So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and
        - Let's go back into the texts and look
        - It says it in the text
        - If we go back and look
        - Go back and look what's another word that we can use STUDENT
        - And what was the name of that machine
        - Yes, a small machine
        - So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use
        - The water on the main for
        - What do astronauts use the water for
        - So why is it a valid valuable
        - But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source
        - What does it say
        - STUDENT right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater
        - I think right?
        - Yes, and that's where they found it
        - That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits
        - So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters
        - I guess it was really cold the
        - It landed on the moon South Pole
        - So tell me, just reading our passage STUDENT
        - Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment
        - So you underlined equipment and discover
        - Did the scientists discover water on the moon with
        - but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small
        - So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there
        - We also read in paragraph three
        - That word could that's in the second sentence
        - Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways
        - So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful
        - And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?
        - Let's stop for a second
        - Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?
        - Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?
        - Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it
        - Okay that is moisture
        - But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon
        - We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that
        - Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink
        - In paragraph three, what does it say about
        - When, when it says we're not able to see it
        - What does it say right after that
        - So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that
        - We can see that there's something in our glass
        - So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here
        - Do you know have you turned before naked eye
        - We can't see it with our naked eye
        - Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater
        - So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small
        - So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that
        - Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water
        - Did it say that it was there
        - So they can be found
        - But this passage was only talking about
        - So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen
        - What they found on the moon
        - The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want STUDENT of you to look in paragraph three
        - What does it say about the water in paragraph three
        - So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see
        - If you look in paragraph to
        - Can you look down at the four sentence
        - My cup right here is 30 ounces
        - Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which
        - I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass
        - so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find
        - NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine
        - Okay, and STUDENT, you are correct
        - Did STUDENT see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph
        - A lunar orbiter is doing a different job
        - They called a lunar orbiter to what?
        - Did they discover water with the microscope?
        - Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second
        - They didn't talk to STUDENT on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues
        - So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues
        - And what did they find with the lunar orbiter
        - Discovering orbiting, looking around
        - Used to investigate
        - STUDENT remind me what investigating means again
        - Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon
        - They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water STUDENT
        - Farrah, are you able to relate to what STUDENT was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water
        - Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading
        - Was there any other equipment that they've talked about
        - What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope
        - What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?
        - They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called
        - And you are exactly right
        - Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called
        - How many of you STUDENT were looking for the word water in the in the passage
        - So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water
        - So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, STUDENT?
        - And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small
        - So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there
        - So let's look back in the text
        - Now let's go back and look at that text
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So it is asking in the text field like back in the text
        - There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right
        - So do you think the microscope to help them
        - Look for water while they're physically on the moon
        - So if you look in the text
        - This is it
        - They use the lunar orbiter right
        - And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water
        - See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon
        - So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment
        - They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water
        - And then we're looking for what?
        - Well, they were looking for water on the moon
        - And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water
        - So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer
        - and, let me read this, um, you said, it, STUDENT, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?
        - Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely
        - What do you think that they need to look things really closely
        - So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small
        - For example, why do you think that they you a microscope
        - If you read the text again
        - Let's get even a little more basic there
        - So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?
        - Very good, very good
        - I'm glad you're seeing it
        - So let's take a look back, STUDENT noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us
        - So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,
        - What makes it very interesting to read
        - But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them STUDENT there we've got this whole elaborate backstory
        - While there is some water there
        - It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water
        - Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes
        - So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right
        - So we know that they're kind of the subject
        - They're kind of who this article was talking about, right
        - And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon
        - But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters
        - Once you take a quick glance at it
        - what did they find these with
        - But what is the text tell you about it
        - And what's the small machine called
        - Okay, NASA send a small machine
        - It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax
        - I'm going to help you read it
        - So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you
        - And what is it called,
        - And what does it say about water can be split into
        - Bob, what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in
        - Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if STUDENT will look back at the second paragraph
        - Discovered yes yes now STUDENT, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water
        - Later on they can study deeper
        - Into the water right they want to look closely at it
        - And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a
        - Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment
        - Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment
        - But what is the microscope helping scientists do
        - Yes, so they are using a microscope
        - That is correct
        - So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about
        - And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper
        - And where did you find that out in the passage
        - Okay, so who can tell me about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Go back to paragraph two
        - STUDENT, can you tell me about the lunar orbiter
        - STUDENT, you go ahead and look at paragraph two
        - What does it say STUDENT about the Lunar Orbiter
        - The ice deposits are very small
        - So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits?
        - Does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph?
        - What do you think the word investigate means
        - Let's go back to paragraph two, once more, it does say NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Once you find it, what else? What else you're going to want to know about it
        - So what are you going to find about it
        - So if you're investigating something you're finding something
        - So yes, STUDENT?
        - You're going to want to know what it is
        - We have to find it and then study it, STUDENT, what do you want to add
        - And if we can look at that paragraph and I want you to circle the word machine
        - Today I would like for STUDENT of you to look back at paragraph number two
        - So what did
        - What did NASA send to investigate
        - Okay, so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me
        - Okay so ice and water
        - Is that the same thing
        - The very first thing some paragraph to NASA send a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So if we will let's underline that sentence on number two
        - And then the second sentence underline that one as well
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the most South Pole and look for ice deposits
        - OK, now let's go on to the third paragraph so
        - If you were looking straight at it
        - Microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - Okay, so you said they could use it for rocket fuel
        - But what other thing didn't say right there that you just read
        - Okay, so let's look in our text for a minute
        - So in our text it says that it is in small amounts
        - So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope
        - Does STUDENT know or have you heard that word before
        - Says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - So you would need to use a microscope to see the water
        - It tells you in paragraph three, does STUDENT see that
        - It was in our reading
        - But what special machine did they use
        - Where did you see that
        - But there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water, but it wasn't what was discovering the water
        - but an excellent place to look is in our text
        - We can look at the text and we can look for clues
        - So we want to find it
        - So that's the next step
        - First, we can look at it until we discover it or find it
        - If we look at, paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine, which is what you wrote what comes next
        - Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - Can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually, it could be valuable
        - So see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future
        - Okay, so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs
        - So paragraphs one and two, you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine
        - It's kind of like a desert
        - That they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry
        - Let's look at paragraph two, we see in paragraph two, there's a Senate's about how NASA send a small machine called a
        - What is that machine called
        - They had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it
        - Yeah, so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So those ice deposits are made out of water
        - the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes
        - The lunar orbiter was used to find the water
        - But the microscope was used for something different
        - The small machine
        - So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used
        - So if you look at your passage you want to use the passage
        - The second half, which is paragraphs four, five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful
        - Like in paragraph five, there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable
        - How could it be used
        - It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel
        - Also, because in the passage
        - That was a detail from the text, but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used
        - And you're right
        - So they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things
        - And then the hydro Jen can actually be used for rocket fuel
        - So they breathe the oxygen
        - So you have to use STUDENT those details
        - So about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water
        - So if you STUDENT would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled
        - In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So this is the machine that actually went and explored
        - But I kind of agree with STUDENT and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine, helped them look into those craters
        - But then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found
        - So the way I looked at it was NASA send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water
        - And I think the piece of using the microscope was for if I traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself, I would have to check under the microscope
        - But the small machine did it without having to send people out there
        - We have a lot of water here on Earth
        - So why do we want water from the moon and to um
        - And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money
        - Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have
        - And the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel
        - What was the name of the small machine
        - And can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about?
        - It said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them, in the moon's craters, but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny, tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope
        - Okay, so let's go back to our text
        - And in paragraph two, the very last sentence, it says these icy deposits are very small
        - We just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers
        - You're absolutely right
        - Just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know, like you said, you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that NASA sent a small machine
        - If an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us, but they didn't send the astronauts
        - They sent a machine
        - If you look at number, the number two paragraph
        - If you STUDENT will look at the passage
        - What machine did they use in that paragraph?
        - Let's look at that paragraph number two
        - And let's look at number three, I want you
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - This lunar orbiter looks like for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - let's look at number two
        - Yeah, let's look at number two, that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me
        - Say the question for me again, Oliveron
        - Let's look back Oliveron, let's look what was the question
        - So what is it asking us
        - Mainly in, let's see, paragraph two
        - And that means the moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Alright, so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article
        - Well, you just read paragraph three again
        - What about number two?
        - Maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three
        - But before that, it talks about how they find evidence of the water right?
        - It doesn't talk about the water
        - Okay, well let's read the paragraph together again
        - Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - look really closely at what?
        - But the question is, how do we find the water
        - So what was used
        - What are the scientists used to find the water
        - So to answer your question, further, let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert
        - That's a really good point
        - Okay, but now I know that's not true
        - So we use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Okay, and we have to use the microscope to look at it
        - Right, and what was that machine called?
        - Don't you STUDENT
        - I think that's really interesting
        - And the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome
        - So would you be able to see it with your regular eye? Would you be able to look down at it?
        - So is there any water on the moon?
        - So where can we find water on the moon? Or where can water be found?
        - So let's look back in the text
        - It says, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters
        - These craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So what equipment did they use?
        - So let's look at where it says that its on paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope
        - So now let's look back in paragraph two, what does it say that they sent to investigate the water
        - These craters or dark places where the sun never shine
        - So in our first paragraph there, it says that you just read it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - So paragraph 2 says on this worksheet that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So you're going to need something to-- small, right? Something that can look at small things, correct?
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater
        - I'm sorry, in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - Very good job reading
        - Stop right there for a minute
        - So paragraph 2 says that NASA has sent a small-- you did a great job rating by the way
        - But, and STUDENT, you did too
        - So we know that the ice deposits are very small
        - So investigate means that we're kind of
        - looking deeper into it
        - enough amount of water to subside people for a long time, right, because waters really heavy
        - So do you think it
        - And it's hard
        - You know, it takes up space on the spaceships
        - They are being able to inhabit the moon right now
        - We're not leaving
        - And and kind of back to Space and you know we're not
        - They hope to one day in the future
        - So that's one reason it's it's really valuable that
        - But so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it
        - We can be able to find water there
        - So let's, it was very important, because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen, oxygen, and you can take those things that
        - Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things
        - So let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - It's in your text and about paragraph five,
        - The oxygen just it's in, it's in here
        - So we can split the water
        - Breathing is very crucial
        - So with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important
        - What's another I really, I'm really glad you found that
        - What's another thing in that paragraph that you could use
        - We cannot live without oxygen
        - The oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water, but what's something else that they can be used for
        - And what much Nate rocket fuel for here on the main
        - So, which one would that be the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope
        - What do you know about ice STUDENT
        - Oh, kind of the same thing, isn't it
        - Right, so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship
        - So I think that's in paragraph two,
        - Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two,
        - It does, it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again
        - Does it say anything about finding a lot of water
        - Where does it say they found a lot of water? Let's look, look at that first paragraph
        - That means that, so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters, they found it really far down
        - Right, so they found it deep
        - Am I looking at stuff
        - What am I doing?
        - Am I making it look really big, so I can really see it or am I zooming out
        - So did I need, um, you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely
        - So did they use a microscope to find it, or just a look at it
        - Well, they, they have to find it first
        - They use it once they find it
        - So they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope
        - Okay, so in our text on the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Let's use evidence from our text
        - Said  they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name
        - Alright, so, um, can STUDENT tell me what paragraph, did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon?
        - Um, what about in the first paragraph there? Do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it?
        - So let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine
        - Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used?
        - Now investigate means to?
        - It's a small machine to investigate
        - So it says the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph
        - Well, we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate
        - Let's read it together real quick
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Okay, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it
        - Well, let's look at page, paragraph three, okay? Do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it
        - Can STUDENT take their finger and put it on number three, find the number three, paragraph 1, 2, 3
        - Do you? Yeah, okay
        - Let the rear end of that paragraph, it talks about what kind of small tool, scientific tool that they would use
        - Does that stand to say anything about any equipment?
        - These craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - So if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - No, I don't see anything in there either
        - So let's move on to our second one, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used?
        - So we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question, because we have found it
        - So the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon, and they use that by starting with the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Does that make sense?
        - So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage
        - So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it
        - So, in the very first paragraph
        - If you STUDENT look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence
        - So now what I want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question
        - Do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource
        - Also says the word valuable
        - I see some nods yes, it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource
        - So we already know, sort of, the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource
        - So when we look at the very first sentence, it says water on the moon would be valuable
        - It then says water is heavy
        - So when you're if you are going up into space, would you want to carry STUDENT these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon
        - Now we have to
        - So if we keep going into paragraph five, it says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon
        - Now I'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe
        - So if water can provide oxygen
        - If you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it STUDENT the way up into space
        - We can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel
        - So that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource
        - So that would also take some weight off your spacecraft
        - So do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples
        - But I'm in the text
        - Could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text, maybe, and
        - And so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text
        - So scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it, but
        - Yeah, and paragraphs three and four
        - Let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though
        - We see that they used after the fact, after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like STUDENT said,
        - Those are the ones I think we need to look at again
        - At paragraphs three and four
        - In a large polar crater
        - It's in a small machine, but specifically the small machine was caled, what
        - So you were right
        - It talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said, and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it Without looking through that microscope
        - Well, let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon
        - And if they didn't wear those they could die
        - So yes, astronauts do wear those as a protective measure
        - So when they're on the moon, they can survive because it's a really cool place
        - Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we STUDENT need to survive with water
        - So really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon, and they would be using that water from the moon
        - The whole reading, she is talking about water on the moon
        - Okay, and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use?
        - Well, so in in here, it talks about the water on the moon
        - Do we STUDENT remember reading that part?
        - So we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one, the water, but the water on the moon specifically, right? So, in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters
        - So then in the second paragraph, it talks about NASA using this small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Does that make sense
        - So what they're doing is that they're using the Orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters
        - And then what they did was, in the third paragraph, they talked about the microscope
        - And so you have to look at it under that microscope, and that's where what STUDENT was talking about
        - And it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely
        - So STUDENT of those tools that they've used helped discover that
        - If you look back in your text, it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They did find craters of water on the moon
        - And that's kind of why they went up to space
        - They wanted to see if there were water in these craters
        - They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters
        - And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter
        - They do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small, but to find the water itself
        - So they can actually view it
        - Does that make sense
        - And that makes sense
        - They didn't necessarily use the microscope, when they found the water, then the microscope came into play
        - Now, does STUDENT see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water
        - So does that make sense where we got that from
        - And like you said STUDENT told me that were the key word was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says NASA send a small machine called a lunar Order, order to investigate
        - Okay, now if you go back into the into the text
        - Do you see anywhere in there that talks about, you know, how it could be valuable
        - So if you go back into the text
        - You see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable
        - It could, you know, for example, what you like the text says you can drink the water, they could use the water
        - because if you go on the read further
        - Eventually for like fuel for this spaceship
        - So by you saying they don't have to carry water
        - Let me just kind of build off that
        - What does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there
        - You know, because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it
        - Yeah, so they don't have to carry it
        - So that's less stuff they have to care or, you know, to bring with them on the spaceship, so they can have room for more people, more supplies and things like that
        - So that's a very good response they have you got a question, buddy
        - To find right so if we're looking to find something
        - What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something
        - Alright, so what, what did they use to investigate
        - What do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text
        - So do you think that might be where we look for our answers, STUDENT
        - Okay, so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable
        - Yep Okay perfect, so let's go down to that section
        - Though the paragraph that you STUDENT read did it tell you what they meant by valuable
        - Did what did it say valuable meant
        - Let's underline very important
        - So make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too
        - So that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right
        - astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen
        - All right, STUDENT, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So you've STUDENT read this once through, right?
        - So let's look back at the text
        - So what tool in here does it say they use to find it?
        - What can hydrogen be used for?
        - What do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for?
        - Okay, so I mean like rocket fuel and the moon, I would that be by valuable
        - And so when you look at that word
        - Let's look at that word again where it says that, it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing?
        - And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it
        - Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope
        - But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small
        - They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic
        - That makes sense?
        - But if we look at the the information that was actually provided
        - And the first statement that it says there
        - So STUDENT look look at it together
        - Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon
        - See how it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate? STUDENT, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be?
        - That's correct, because if you look at the name Lunar Orbiter and look at what each of those words mean
        - Lunar refers to what? Do you know?
        - Lunar means something dealing with the moon
        - And so what would an orbiter be? What does orbit orbit mean?
        - Because Lunar Orbiter means orbiting, flying around the moon
        - And so they have a small machine
        - It's not actually on the moon
        - It's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water
        - Does that make sense?
        - For example, STUDENT, do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope, but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon
        - That's very good
        - And if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope
        - But in this case, they haven't actually landed on the moon
        - They're simply using the Lunar Orbiter to study the moon from a distance
        - So, so STUDENT
        - Do you know what a lunar orbiter is
        - And so, STUDENT
        - They sent a lunar orbiter have up there
        - Well, let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter
        - This is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon
        - Like satellite flies in space
        - So it's orbiting the moon
        - So around the moon
        - It was launched on a rocket from Earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room
        - And so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon
        - That makes sense
        - Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small
        - Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller
        - In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope
        - So it's very hard to see
        - Okay Oliver or Sabina, what do you STUDENT use a microscope for
        - So they use a machine a tool, similar to the microscope, like you STUDENT said to discuss to investigate and discover, and that was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So they did use a small machine
        - Do you know what the name of that machine was
        - Do you know they were trying to find
        - And what did that lunar orbiter do so
        - So if we go back and read this sentence that I'm STUDENT read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter
        - So what did the lunar orbiter do STUDENT
        - And what did they discover in those ice deposits
        - So I'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water
        - So those ice deposits held what
        - So by using the Lunar Orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores
        - What was holding the water
        - What else, what else do we mean STUDENT besides water
        - We need air to breathe
        - Did they have air on the moon yet
        - They can drink it, can we survive without water
        - So my question was, can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does? So I want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two
        - So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter, STUDENT, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small
        - Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate
        - What did they use to investigate?
        - So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something
        - Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits
        - you would definitely, they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water,
        - but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph, it says, you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon
        - You know, we human beings breathe oxygen
        - And perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon
        - And that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water, even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon
        - and then do you remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter what it was doing
        - When we look back over the text in paragraph two, um, what, what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So when looking at the paragraph, um,
        - I know that there are two words that
        - Students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different
        - And then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it
        - The difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use
        - They do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph
        - And then microscopic is the, um,
        - It's a form of the microscopic ice
        - So when we look at our paragraph
        - If we're looking at paragraph
        - No, excuse me, paragraph to
        - It talks about that
        - Do you, do you see the name I'm looking through the paragraph
        - What did the lunar orbiter do
        - So we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate
        - It's in the large polar crater
        - They saw the US deposit
        - What details that it gave about they asked deposits
        - So they use the Lord the Lunar Orbiter to to to
        - Investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small
        - We know that we have the Lunar Orbiter and that it's used to
        - That that NASA is using this to form the ice deposits
        - Or to investigate the ice deposits, but
        - So what does microscopic mean what does it tell us
        - Does STUDENT remember what it was used to do
        - And it was in what form
        - So when we look at, paragraph two,
        - What was it called
        - We know that NASA sent the small machine
        - The Lunar Orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do
        - The third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question
        - We know that the water they found it was what
        - What type of ice
        - And where was the microscopic us at
        - And it was what did it do
        - First, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter?
        - So I guess back to Farrahs question
        - So which one do you want to focus on
        - So how, so we've identified the equipment
        - How do they use this equipment to look and discover water
        - So what in that paragraph STUDENT, what is that telling us about the microscope?
        - What does that tell you about the water
        - And if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon
        - So what does that tell you about the water on the moon
        - Is there a lot of it
        - So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter
        - Do you know what a polar crater is
        - Is can you imagine
        - The Lunar Orbiter landing at the moon South Pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon
        - Based on what you just read what do you think about the, what is the point of the microscope
        - Who's the they that you're talking about
        - Okay, so that could be a benefit of having water
        - So let's talk more about that
        - I'm glad you know that, but it's also in the text
        - Could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me
        - So yeah, exactly
        - You're exactly right
        - And water is heavy
        - And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could
        - You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome
        - Well, let's focus on the text
        - The second part, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So I see first
        - So yes, just like if you can't breathe oxygen, you're going to need an oxygen tank
        - Kind of like if you're playing basketball
        - For an organized sport, you're probably going to need a jersey right to play
        - But the important tool is the basketball itself
        - We go back into the text, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - So then that that is also true NASA send a small machine
        - Just go back and reread number four
        - That might change your answer
        - But if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four
        - Okay, so let's look back in the text
        - Let's read it says let's reread the text quickly
        - It says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places, wherever, or where the sun never shines
        - That's our key word STUDENT
        - Can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - There you go
        - Can you tell us what do you think?
        - Okay, so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do, based on our reading
        - In the texts that are going to talk about equipment
        - So first of all, we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what STUDENT
        - Can you be more specific
        - But a small machine
        - About that small machine
        - What was that called
        - Let's look back in the text
        - So once we have
        - So let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope
        - Then we want to look and see which one's the best
        - Found types of equipment
        - Would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us, please
        - So we are on the first page in paragraph number three
        - Okay, so are they saying, Is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used
        - Or something that you would need to use to look really closely
        - Out of water, they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool, but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it
        - Okay, so did it say that they used a microscope
        - It said you need
        - So you'd a contraction for you would need
        - So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - And what is one thing that you know about space that can help us
        - So can STUDENT summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have, how did they work together in this article
        - We know that we have to use oxygen in space
        - And see what equipment we use before the microscope
        - And so, specifically in paragraph two, we have NASA sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen, but a different tool
        - And we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water, which, in turn, we use the microscope, because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon
        - So you're absolutely right
        - We can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own, which we use for what
        - So I want STUDENT to look at paragraph five, and see how else we can use The water on the moon
        - Now how STUDENT, do you, can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go
        - Do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts
        - So that is in Question or paragraph number two, or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope
        - But let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope
        - So once you've discovered it
        - now STUDENT in your answer in your response you named a type of machine
        - And now you can look at it
        - So the microscope is what's looking at it
        - Now you found it
        - Yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other
        - What was that machine
        - Yeah, say, STUDENT said that she found her answer in paragraph two
        - STUDENT, What do you have to say
        - So we know what headings are in our text
        - The first heading is the moon is a desert
        - It's the bolted words, who can read to me what the second heading is
        - So there are two headings here
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look at this reading passage, does STUDENT know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions
        - What key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question
        - So as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind
        - So we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - And in the text it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Can you point to it
        - Can you show me where it says that in the text
        - So if you look back in the text and paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - What does that mean that the water is microscopic
        - What do you need to see the water
        - And so from the passage STUDENT
        - So I think what might help us is to maybe, you know, over the passage, a little bit
        - I think specifically part to see if we can STUDENT find the passage
        - And what was that small machine called
        - Do you remember
        - Why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon
        - How was the water described in the passage
        - How small was it
        - So according to that passage STUDENT, what is the what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water
        - Let's see what paragraph three says, Uh, maybe we can discuss the difference
        - So if we look back at the question, what do you think the key words in the question are
        - But before they could use the microscope
        - What did they use to get to the moon
        - They use the microscope
        - Can STUDENT go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called?
        - I agree, but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs, what knowledge, are we getting from those
        - Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps
        - Well, let's look at our texts and figure it out together
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - So in paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - To be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye, you needed the microscope to be able to really
        - So they did use other pieces of equipment to help them, but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Zoom in and see it
        - You know the name of that machine they sent?
        - Okay, so, STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two, and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that NASA sent
        - However, STUDENT, do you see in the paragraph, where it talks about the machine that they sent
        - Okay, let's look at paragraph two,
        - So what do we think STUDENT microscopic means
        - So it was really small
        - So the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely
        - So the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it
        - There's a small amount of it
        - So it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic, it's so little and such a small amount
        - Wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it, then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount
        - So they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely, they would need the microscope
        - Very good, very good
        - In a moment after our answer Farrahs question I'd like us to go through and identify some of these words, STUDENT, what's your question?
        - Now while I'm reading this, I see a lot of words that maybe I do, maybe I do not quite understand
        - Or maybe just need some clarification, take just a moment, raise your hand when you find one
        - So look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean
        - Absolutely they did use that to get to the moon, didn't they? But really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well
        - Do you know?
        - What does that mean, STUDENT
        - That's one of the words that pops out to me
        - We actually can't see it, just looking at it, can we, so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it
        - Yeah, it means so small
        - helped me look back, I'm looking at
        - Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?
        - If you look back
        - Thank you for that
        - However, if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth, from what I see
        - So let's look specifically at paragraph number two, both of them mentioned craters
        - is that a lot of water STUDENT
        - And if we go back
        - So it's really, really small and spread over a really large area
        - It actually says that we need a microscope to see the water
        - Does that make sense
        - More specifically, that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it, you would need to have already discovered it by this point, right
        - If we look at the microscope
        - Yeah, so um in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, and basically look for these ice deposits, and since the water was so small, we then have to use a microscope to see it
        - Why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon
        - And you type in your answer, you said they need the microscope to look real closely
        - What is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it
        - And why can't you see it with your eyes?
        - What is it about water
        - That's going to make tiny objects appear large
        - So, you know, you think about water on Earth
        - We STUDENT need a microscope
        - We look at ponds, lakes, oceans, we can see that water
        - But on the line as conveyed in that passage, we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope
        - So, good job there
        - That's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters
        - I'd like you to focus on just the microscopes, does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon
        - However, I do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself
        - Was the microscope used to find water on the moon?
        - Was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon, and STUDENT get to in just a minute
        - What was on the moon
        - Was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon?
        - So I would like you to do STUDENT is go back to the text
        - You know, they found water in the moon, you know, they found it in the craters and that's great
        - I want you to ask yourself what equipment, did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon
        - They could, but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon
        - Can't really bring that water with them
        - You know, you need to save as much space as you can
        - And it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon
        - So, the less weight, I can turn that rocket the more money I'm going to save
        - The fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right
        - Is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable
        - What else is valuable
        - As a stage to go further into the solar system like Mars
        - And you're absolutely right
        - So they're going to need fuel, they're going to need oxygen, they're going to need hydrogen
        - Water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base, they might potentially build
        - Who don't want an orbiter
        - What did it say that we did with it
        - Are you STUDENT thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small
        - If you have that machine and you have a microscope
        - Are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water
        - So do you think based off of what you STUDENT just told me that
        - They do use those and article even talks about using those different things
        - If you were looking straight at it
        - It's are we going to look at large bodies of water
        - So from that scene
        - Is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - The reason why you have to use a microscope, you can't see it with your naked eye
        - Right, so we're looking at microscopic micro being small
        - They use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one
        - but STUDENT, you brought up a great point
        - Do you STUDENT remember what the other equipment that they used
        - What did you just breathe in
        - But guess what the moon does not have
        - Is it going to be very heavy
        - But think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy
        - Okay, so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like
        - How are you picturing it
        - Is it big
        - So, what did you guys see in your mind when I read that? STUDENT?
        - Okay, so what so STUDENT
        - What would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text
        - And this is one of those tools that you probably saw at NASA STUDENT when you went to go visit
        - Now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module
        - This lunar module again just like STUDENT said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters
        - This would help them find water
        - And now, what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen
        - There's a clue in paragraph five, yes STUDENT
        - Water can be valuable
        - Yes, we do have some Olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel
        - There are a lot of uses for water
        - Day now is the technology ready
        - I would say I would say probably no
        - But there are some uses that we could use water for in the future, even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen
        - A small machine can you you know what that small machine called?
        - Can you go back in the text and fine what that small machine is called?
        - So let's look back in the story and see if we can find those tools
        - So there's two tools
        - can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called
        - So we're going to look back and we're going to see if we can find it in the text
        - Let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question
        - So let's look back and see what we can find
        - So let's see if we can find the answer in our story
        - And then, paragraph three, this is where STUDENT got her answer
        - Do you remember what the name of that small machine was
        - Maybe we can take a closer look at the reading to and get some other feedback
        - So did you hear the beginning of what you said there was a specific name of a little tool that they used to investigate in water
        - Yeah, so that was definitely
        - It was a form of a microscope
        - It was a small machine
        - And that's what
        - I'm sure that they didn't use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like STUDENT said, but there was that one little piece in the text that gave the specific name of the tool
        - We did read that
        - It's called a Moon, lunar orbiter
        - And that it investigates so that's why NASA sends it up there
        - So you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon
        - The lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon, and the microscope like STUDENT said is used to look at small particles, that the Lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things
        - So you could always write that to that, even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small, they still can't see
        - STUDENT these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable, which means that people can live there for humans like us
        - Usually, they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon, try to see if anyone from earth can be able to live in the moon, yes STUDENT
        - But I want to kind of make it a little more clear for STUDENT because the microscope
        - So in the texts that you STUDENT read, they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there
        - Does STUDENT remember what was said in the text about the Lunar Orbiter
        - It was mentioned in the text, and I want to see it
        - yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water, but when they're doing this, they might not be doing this on the moon, so, if you look at the second paragraph, can you read the first sentence for me
        - that's a really good question to ask and that's something that I think STUDENT of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading, so if the water is not ready yet, is it not valuable
        - Go back and look at the text, so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says, you know future astronauts could drink this water, water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room
        - So do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship
        - Yes, and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage
        - But the real name of the machine was a microscope
        - Sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine
        - So we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs, right? So you you caught that first in paragraph two, but if you kept reading in paragraph three, you would have seen the real word for the small machine, right?
        - Okay, what is that small machine
        - What did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon?
        - What specifically did it investigate? Use your evidence from the text
        - Right and ice is water correct just frozen
        - The small machine as you recognized is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon
        - What equipment did they use? You can look back in the text to help you
        - So you discover that there was water on the moon
        - So can you elaborate on why they use the microscope? What did they do using the microscope?
        - Um, so you're right, they do use microscopes to look really closely
        - And how does that relate back to the question?
        - Why did they need the microscope?
        - If you go back to the microscope that STUDENT was talking about, how did they find water using the microscope?
        - So they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon
        - Does it say it in the text?
        - That's how they found the water STUDENT
        - Using small machine that STUDENT identified
        - And then they took the microscope that STUDENT found in the text and used that to look at the water
        - STUDENT right, so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert
        - And microscope is one of the pieces of equipment, but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment
        - Equipment could be a machine a piece of technology, do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment
        - Paragraph two STUDENT right, can you tell me what it is
        - Okay, great that is a piece of equipment that they use, can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is
        - Now, how did they use the Lunar orbiter to find water, you said that they looked for ice deposits right
        - Great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted
        - Can you find any in the text
        - all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as STUDENT
        - In reading that you also found that the small machine was called what?
        - Right and this paragraph, also tells you what a lunar orbiter does, can you tell me what the Lunar orbiter does
        - Perfect, now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon
        - yeah absolutely they had to use
        - Okay, so to review what you were saying they use the Lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water
        - So a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon
        - So yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon, they couldn't make like a gas station, so now it's time that could be important,
        - a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water, first, to use a microscope to look at the water, so you actually need the Lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon
        - orbit to discover the water that is already on the load and you would use a like semana and STUDENT said you would use a microscope to look at the sample the water that you found on the moon, if that makes sense
        - the creatives are not full of water, it was a little bit of water in the craters on the moon, that the Lunar orbit does that
        - I don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading I think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon, yes
        - But that wasn't exactly what it was about
        - You use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes
        - Yeah, and I think if we look back into our reading, we can find specifics
        - So in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon, so we found that
        - We found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers
        - or anything that helps you find the water, so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw
        - yeah that's a great answer, thank you, so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the Lunar orbiter
        - And Luis now that we've heard from STUDENT we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon, is there any other
        - If you look in the second sentence
        - No the one that starts with "NASA sent"
        - Do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent, STUDENT?
        - So you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient
        - They um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer
        - Exactly, but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place
        - And the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it, so the microscope help them to see the water better, but I did it help them find the water
        - Does STUDENT know what microscopic means?
        - Microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it
        - but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text
        - So STUDENT, you may have gone to NASA but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying, because the question is specific to the passage
        - So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar
        - lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - yeah so, which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and NASA can be valuable to us
        - Having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things, which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response
        - Where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - But I want you to look, I want STUDENT to look on paragraph 2 where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Do you think that this refers to the question at STUDENT?
        - The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Yes, so we're-- we're going to look at-- I want STUDENT to look at the machine it's referencing to
        - And I want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to
        - What does it do though? So what does the machine do?
        - What does it investigate?
        - Do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance?
        - I want someone else to answer this
        - So going back to what STUDENT said, the machine looks for ice deposits
        - So does STUDENT-- can anyone understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for
        - Does STUDENT agree with that?
        - But ice deposits are water
        - So that's the important part of the reading
        - Good point of the storywise, they were looking for ice deposits
        - Yeah, and what are ice deposits?
        - And what are the ice deposits?
        - Yes , ice deposits are frozen water
        - And so they use that equipment to what?
        - So they're using it to investigate the water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT have any questions about that?
        - The water because the water is the ice deposit
        - Does STUDENT know what ice deposits are?
        - So when we look at the second sentence, we can see ice deposits
        - Have a guess what is deposits are?
        - So is there any similarity between ice and water? Does STUDENT know the similarity between ice and water?
        - Ice is frozen water
        - That is a type of equipment
        - So ice so ice and water on the same thing
        - They're both water just in different forms
        - So going back to what STUDENT said earlier, NASA a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - Well the microscope is looking for something
        - So going back to Farrah's question before
        - When you said, why is the microscope the wrong answer
        - But the way it's written in paragraph two, they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water, then they use a microscope
        - I want you STUDENT to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope
        - I want you to think
        - Does STUDENT know the difference between these two types of equipment? Anything, any guesses is fine, from what you see in the reading
        - The first word was microscope and the second was the small machine
        - So, from what i've heard from you STUDENT, you guys circled two words
        - STUDENT, go ahead
        - I want you to look at the reading, I want you to think why they might be different, it might help you
        - Does STUDENT know why they might be different? Luis's on the right track, but does anyone know why they might be different? Look at the reading
        - What about anything else? STUDENT else noticed anything in the reading?
        - But STUDENT you're on the right track with finding ice deposits
        - Does STUDENT know the similarity between ice deposits and water?
        - And ice ice and water are the same thing, because they're both water
        - And from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really -what are they really?
        - Ice is frozen water
        - What else are they? what are the ice deposits, what did we just say?
        - So the lunar orbiter is finding what?
        - So do you think - does that make any sense? So what is the microscope, what does the microscope do?
        - So what are we using the microscope in this reading? what are they using the microscope for in this reading?
        - At the water, that's right STUDENT
        - So they already found the water when they use the microscope
        - So the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope
        - So if you have any questions about that
        - If you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer
        - No, so no So what are they using the find the water?
        - What was the machine called
        - look back to the reading
        - And do you know why based on the reading
        - They sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - What were they looking for
        - A lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters
        - So like the Lunar Orbiter
        - Why don't we look at the reading STUDENT
        - Let's look at the reading together
        - So what does it say in the second paragraph
        - So looking back in that
        - Thank you for reading that
        - What did you find what kind of equipment
        - It was very helpful
        - So if you keep reading that sentence, why did NASA send that to the moon, what about it, what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why
        - what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes
        - Perfect so NASA send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon,
        - right it's too small, so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it
        - Perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph, in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important Can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon
        - Can you read that
        - So I really liked your response
        - You said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And do you remember what we were looking really closely at?
        - So the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny
        - And if you remember in the reading, we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon, but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it
        - And STUDENT, I also really liked your response
        - But do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters
        - So can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - And do you remember what the lunar orbiter did?
        - And what did it and what wasn't looking for, STUDENT remember that one?
        - So STUDENT, just go back
        - So the lunar orbiter was used
        - It was a small machine sent by NASA to look for ice deposits and craters
        - So what it's really having us do here Oliver is it's having us infer that they use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon, so I can see why you are confused, but am I helping you clear this up at STUDENT, but the Lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon
        - it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert
        - That you said you know that it's a small machine, they said, but can you tell me anything more about it, like what did you find interesting about it, maybe the name of the machine
        - Okay, let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading
        - Did they use any equipment
        - Going to look back at your text is it on your tablets
        - Do you did you see any textual evidence in the first quote that says anything about equipment
        - There wasn't anything mentioned about equipment you want to move on to the next quote
        - Can you point out any equipment used
        - Can you specify what they called it though
        - Just the small machine
        - Now let's move on to the last quote
        - Can you tell me what it does
        - So in the text explains the lunar orbiter does something
        - And how it helps scientists, maybe
        - Can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote
        - Can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe
        - Or did they mention anything more about equipment
        - I believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter
        - And in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - It's equipment using it
        - So that was the equipment that the NASA had sent up to the space
        - Help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes, where the microscope, because that's an equip up piece of equipment
        - That can be used to help look at small little things, and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes
        - They use STUDENT that stuff, but specifically here in the text, where do we, where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters
        - So although they did use a microscope to look at
        - You see in the text
        - Let's go back to the text and see if that's true
        - Can STUDENT find in the text where it says
        - where it talks about what tools they use to find the water
        - However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water
        - Um STUDENT, I really like your
        - But back to the text
        - They might -Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you STUDENT notice that?
        - Right? So they say that they looked for so that like STUDENT said
        - They use the they use the small machine
        - So ice is just dried up water
        - The Lunar the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits
        - In the third paragraph, the water they found is microscopic so
        - And sometimes they the text is saying that
        - This in the beginning of the end of paragraph two, they say ice deposits are very small
        - And then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it, which means that it's really small
        - If you put those two together, you can infer or guess from that, that ice deposits is where the water was stored
        - So, if that's where the water was, what did they use to find the ice deposits? Can STUDENT tell me? Can anyone refer to the text?
        - So can STUDENT find in the text where it mentions um discovering
        - Where it mentions discovering
        - Or discovering something on the moon
        - Your response, which I think points us to a different part of the text that also mentions um discovering
        - Something on the moon
        - yeah awesome and that's awesome knowledge and thank you for sharing that with us
        - Um just to redirect us bit back to the to the text, and to the topic um
        - So I think can STUDENT recognize that there are two places in the text that talk about where we find something or water on the moon?
        - Now, if we look at the text where it talks about
        - These small the small machine can STUDENT find the name of the small machine?
        - And if we actually take take a, take a look back at the text, you can actually see that
        - So you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it
        - And then, now that we've STUDENT understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope
        - Like STUDENT said
        - If we look in paragraph three
        - and now we also can keep looking at the reading
        - We can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it, you wouldn't be able to see it
        - So definitely what STUDENT said yes
        - And then let's keep reading, paragraph three, in the last sentence that says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly
        - Well, they use an orbiter
        - to discover water on the moon scientist used blank can you remember what the scientists use on the moon
        - Now were there any others are those the only two that you could find I stopped after paragraph three, but if I keep
        - Yes, that is correct
        - But when you reach the third paragraph, you'll see that small machine they used
        - And that is in the second paragraph, NASA did send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters
        - The small machine is called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So if we look back in the second paragraph, you're right
        - It says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found
        - That's looking to find the water
        - But as we see it in the third paragraph
        - You need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope, because you can only see it with the microscope, not the Lunar Orbiter
        - So if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water
        - Um, so, STUDENT, did you see, you said that you saw the microscope, and it was used to look really closely
        - Look really closely at
        - Then, STUDENT right, well, so let's move on
        - So what did the microscope
        - So what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon
        - It says that this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - And microscope and what is the microscope
        - Right, so how did they use a microscope to find the water
        - um, and what the question was asked before, and it is right because I
        - Is being used to ISIS and different form of water
        - It's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters, which helps them find water
        - The microscope was used to look at the water, but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon, so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it
        - And then afterwards, they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it
        - But that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on, so I think you bring up a great point STUDENT, that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon
        - That is a great point so off the bat STUDENT, we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource
        - um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable
        - The water is actually very heavy so
        - it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials
        - So although, your answer was correct, that we do need to drink water, the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship
        - so referring back to your texts
        - So it's actually both of them
        - So in our text in the second bullet point, it says that NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, they used both the Lunar Orbiter
        - And the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits, which is another form of water right I use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon
        - But if you think back to STUDENT response, she said I referred to the text and I thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text, what do you notice about the specific tools, it says they used to discover water on the moon
        - Maybe even what what are they investigating, if you think back to the question, what are they investigating what was that tool used for
        - it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so
        - Right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So that's the type of equipment isn't it
        - yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south Pole and looks for ice deposits and then, if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope
        - If you refer back to the text, and you think about what STUDENT added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water, but if you look at paragraph two, can you tell me what machine NASA sent to discover the water?
        - It says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah
        - yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water, like you have to think about ice or like gases, you know it give me a little bit tricky so
        - Right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon, that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon, but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right
        - Right, so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there, and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right
        - They needed an equipment to look very, very close to that little block of ice, and then they would see if there is water in there
        - So even if you're looking straight to it, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not
        - One second, STUDENT
        - STUDENT, you want to share something with us?
        - So they needed an equipment that would help them
        - I'll be right back with you
        - But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that
        - And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-- STUDENT?
        - So that's kind of like a little microscope
        - STUDENT Can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use?
        - So i'm going to give you two minutes to read the text and really closely read it with the question keep the questions in mind as you're reading
        - You are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples, at least two examples
        - And then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples
        - of why finding water on the moon, is important
        - Good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon
        - start with the other colored highlighter you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well
        - and find two examples of equipment news done the moon, and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful, after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you STUDENT need any more time
        - you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three
        - That while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water
        - Do you, if you look back into our texts called water on the moon,
        - What is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text
        - Kind of look in the text and
        - Who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon
        - Yeah, so I so that the sentence that STUDENT is referring to is in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine Jazmin
        - Can you read us the rest of that sentence
        - They're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said
        - NASA send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment, since we're talking about the equipment they use, but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah STUDENT
        - About what those small machine is called
        - Do you remember what the small machine was called
        - So let's talk about the actual tools that were used, which I know some of you used in your explanation
        - STUDENT want to raise their hand and just list, maybe, one of the tools that were used, a specific tool that the scientists used
        - And that's right and we saw that in, I believe, the third part of the--
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope
        - OK, and they used that in a specific line which STUDENT noticed, when they set the water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it
        - And that is true, they did
        - And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-- and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon
        - Yeah, so they use the microscope has any have, have any of you STUDENT ever use a microscope before,
        - Have you ever
        - So you have used to it
        - What have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing, right
        - And what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water
        - So when you say NASA send a small machine
        - Do you know exactly what that machine was called
        - But do you know what we're looking closely at?
        - You said, you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely, which is which is very true
        - Do you remember why NASA sent a small machine and maybe what it's called
        - Okay, so if we look back to our reading
        - Does STUDENT remember why they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter
        - You know why they have to use a microscope, so do you
        - Why do they need a microscope to look really closely
        - Do you know what a microscope is
        - So if you use a microscope
        - Look at really small things
        - Why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon
        - So based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters
        - But what happened first is NASA sent the machine, so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon, to look for the water
        - Exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand STUDENT what's going on
        - So at NASA they have like STUDENT said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and
        - helmets to go into space and then scientists, a lot of scientists, they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves
        - So where that fits into our reading if scientists, so we sent the machine into onto the moon, we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter
        - And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it STUDENT goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects
        - yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon, but a tiny little machine did it for us, so we didn't have to send STUDENT up there, that makes sense
        - I just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon, so there was a very small amount
        - So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope STUDENT right
        - So the Lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the Lunar orbiter looks for that right
        - I want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and Deb, I saw that in your answer
        - You had similar
        - Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter
        - Answer to STUDENT, so do
        - So in the text
        - It tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves
        - They send these machines, like you said, STUDENT NASA send a small machine which is called the Lunar Orbiter to Earth
        - NASA sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so
        - And as I was talking about with STUDENT that the scientists weren't actually sent out to NASA
        - But why do you
        - In that sense, the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen
        - Why do you think that using the text
        - Why do you think that NASA would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts
        - So they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts
        - It was, it's like, it's so as STUDENT was saying it's a machine
        - And does STUDENT remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter does
        - So basically, it gets a closer look
        - I was thinking
        - That one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the Lunar Orbiter, but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on Earth, get a closer look to the moon
        - Yes, exactly, and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters
        - things on the moon right, specifically the ice deposits
        - The the fourth paragraph, which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question,
        - We know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said
        - is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters,  that's what paragraph told us
        - Go ahead, STUDENT
        - Now Can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does, can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you guys raise your hand and when you guys could share with the STUDENT
        - All right, let's get back to what STUDENT was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because, on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft
        - STUDENT could you tell us what that something else is? It's in paragraph five
        - We also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else
        - Did you notice I'm a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water
        - When you talked about the microscope
        - I loved your answer
        - Have you ever seen a microscope
        - Does STUDENT know, raise your hand
        - Do you know
        - Yeah, awesome, isn't it, what do you use my microscopes for
        - ever used a microscope
        - Okay, do you think it would be really cool to have a little waters on it and see that there's water in the moon from the story that we read
        - STUDENT that right that's me okay sorry I couldn't really see your name tag um so I was wondering, so I remember you were talking about how NASA send a small machine Do you remember what the machines name was
        - You were talking about how, in paragraph three, it talks about the
        - hmm and do you remember, if there was anything from the article that i'm told us if the water was used is there anything else, that it can be used for
        - No, it is much better, like the water was on the moon, because then the ship doesn't have to carry STUDENT that water, and it will make the ship more heavy yes even
        - yeah so I remember when I was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel to
        - Which is very helpful, do you STUDENT remember reading that part
        - Does STUDENT want to like talk about how that could be very useful and valuable maybe yeah yeah I can
        - know that could help us a lot right
        - yeah that could be really cool imagine if there was a gas station like on the moon
        - So I was just going over your responses
        - What are they looking closely at?
        - STUDENT, you say that they need a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found in the craters, right?
        - So based off of that, where do we think the water is being found?
        - It says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - These craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - So let's read number one again
        - Can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does?
        - OK, so let's look at the actual sentences, OK? So we've already talked about the microscope, but if you look at number two, it says NASA sent a small machine
        - What does it investigate?
        - What does it investigate?
        - Awesome, and why do you think it looks for ice deposits? What would the ice deposits tell us?
        - Yeah, but what would it tell us that involves water?
        - Yeah, so can we have ice without water?
        - Right, so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere, right?
        - So why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on Mars-- the moon, not Mars
        - OK, that's really interesting
        - Well, let's look at this sentence right here
        - It says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - So what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see?
        - But can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited
        - I can read you the sentence if you'd like
        - It's an NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small
        - Okay, and the end of the article says that
        - So let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to
        - Oh, I think it's in paragraph number five
        - Take a look at the second paragraph of the article
        - What machine did NASA said that they use to discover the water?
        - So then after they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - What did they use to look at the water?
        - Look at the third paragraph
        - STUDENT, you said that they use a small machine
        - So great job, recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon
        - Do you remember what the name of the machine was called?
        - Okay, that's totally fine
        - Let's look at the passage and see, just like with STUDENT Let's look at the second paragraph
        - And then, do you remember what the other
        - The other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water?
        - So they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny
        - Alright, let's look at the third paragraph
        - Look at the third paragraph
        - So can you - before they found the water, what did they use to find it?
        - So they found the water and used the microscope to use - to see the water because it was so tiny
        - But what did they do to find it? Do you remember?
        - Do you remember the second machine?
        - So you said the scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine
        - What does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at
        - So if scientists are using a tool called a microscope
        - And so we know the word microscopic means what
        - Yeah, so the small water
        - You can think about things
        - What else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon
        - Maybe you've used a microscope
        - STUDENT have you used a microscope before?
        - Because plant cells are also really small, like the water on the moon that STUDENT mentioned
        - Wow, that's a great connection STUDENT, because we are talking about scientists, but there's also many other occupations and jobs that people do were like doctors who use microscopes
        - And then after that it also talks about small ice deposits, which then
        - You have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon
        - What, what was the machine called, what they do
        - Can you be a little more specific
        - And what did the machine do, what is used for?
        - They do, but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on?
        - So that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon
        - Because remember, they didn't know if we had any, and then they found it
        - But do you know-- like STUDENT said the microscope, do you know why they use a microscope from the text?
        - Do you know why they have to look at it so close?
        - So it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close
        - It's talks about the water they found is microscopic
        - So in the third one
        - So they use both
        - So they use the Lunar Orbiter to look for the ice deposits in the craters, and that's where they could find The water
        - So they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both
        - Finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water, because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the Lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the
        - so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence
        - Can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence?
        - So I know that a lot of you STUDENT did mention being able to use a microscope
        - So now, what's something where something that stands out in that sentence
        - STUDENT right, well, if you look at the story, you see in the second paragraph, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - That would be considered another piece of equipment that NASA used
        - And I also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage So when I want you STUDENT all to do individually, I want you guys to look at the passage the moon, is a desert
        - a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it, but the microscope itself did not get it STUDENT the way up to the moon okay
        - And let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, which is where I think
        - So um STUDENT, can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two?
        - Right, so what we know that the ice deposits are very, very tiny, so I lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right
        - Okay, so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer
        - So STUDENT remember, we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon, but a microscope could be used for anything
        - Okay, that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together
        - And that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that
        - But what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic
        - So if you can look at, paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon
        - They didn't use it to discover the water
        - The lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon, but the ice deposits are very small
        - So they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water
        - So they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon
        - So they so let's talk as a STUDENT
        - So the amount of water that they find is going to be very small
        - And they're looking for ice deposits, but the ice deposits are very small
        - So then, in paragraph three, what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water
        - So the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what
        - And the second piece of equipment was called what
        - The microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small
        - In the article, if you could go back and look, when they used the microscope, they get and use the microscope to find the water
        - NASA did use a small machine
        - Can you tell me what that small machine was?
        - Now when they discovered the water on the moon, did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny, tiny amounts of water?
        - And that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it
        - But STUDENT told us that the article says that in order to see the water, we would need what, Farrah?
        - If you look at paragraph 3, it says the water they found is microscopic
        - So STUDENT, they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water
        - And in order to see the water, they would need to use a microscope
        - So how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article?
        - And what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable?
        - So why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts? What could those things-- what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for? What do we use oxygen for?
        - Yep, so smart
        - So breathing would be a good use for the oxygen
        - What about the hydrogen?
        - I have to read too because I don't know what we use it for
        - Astronauts could breathe the oxygen
        - So we could do it together
        - And oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Do you STUDENT see that?
        - So paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen
        - And what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft?
        - Does the article tell us that water is light, or is water heavy?
        - And it would take up a lot of space, right?
        - So taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon, it would be a lot of weight
        - What does it tell us that the problems could be? What's the issue with the research? It's at the very end of the article
        - The article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water-- a convincing argument for why this would be useful
        - And it would take a lot of money
        - They would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface
        - So if NASA didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment, those things could be a problem
        - So in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters, and that making the plan, it would take a lot of time
        - And they would have to build new equipment
        - Exactly, it's divine something
        - So did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place
        - Do you think
        - Or maybe they use something else
        - And do you know what that small machine is called
        - Does STUDENT remember where they found the water?
        - OK, so the if you read on, in the second paragraph, it talks about how the craters were in  Deposits of ice
        - Right, so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing
        - And ice is really hard to get through
        - So the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice
        - So what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two,
        - The hydrogen in the oxygen
        - It can be water can be broken down into two parts
        - Can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be
        - Why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else
        - Broken down into two parts, because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen
        - There you go, and is breathing important
        - You see, right, especially when you're in space when there is an oxygen
        - You could get the water right there, split it up and have oxygen to breathe
        - What else do we use water for that talks about in paragraph four,
        - Drinking water is important, right, do we need that to survive
        - They'll know it's there
        - So if the water is already there
        - The astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or Storing as much on their spacecraft
        - So then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens, there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome
        - Because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things
        - So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts?
        - Right, so that there's some evidence behind that and we breathe in oxygen, there's evidence of that
        - So those are things we STUDENT have our own opinions, but those are things that you can prove to be true
        - Alright, so we have three different many paragraphs at the top
        - Can I please have someone be volunteer
        - To tell me what they think the main idea is for the main point of the first paragraph is
        - The textual evidence that says the scientists found water on the moon
        - And when you found that and underlined it
        - Whoever finds it first can raise their hand and read back to me the exact words in that first point, the talks about scientists mining water on the moon, and we'll see if we agree with STUDENT
        - STUDENT can review it in front of them
        - And then when you're ready, raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph
        - Yes, okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close
        - Let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water, especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water
        - Can you reread paragraph two, for me, and see if you can find any other answers
        - Who was doing the discovery in the question
        - And the answer, you'll find is in the text
        - Do you think you could try to Read the question and maybe look at the text
        - Yes, in this story that we read
        - Totally because if if you ever get a question which might happen again and other classes or places you a question
        - The text is probably very important
        - And there's a text there
        - Does the machine have a name?
        - Okay, small that works
        - Okay, there's actually another piece of equipment in there
        - Could you maybe look at that piece of equipment too just so I know that you can find an answer in a text
        - Can STUDENT explain how they did that
        - Does STUDENT know what that machine is called
        - I want you STUDENT to take a minute to skim through the text and to think about what you think the main idea of this text was
        - Right now, I want you STUDENT to take one second, just give her the text and fake
        - Can STUDENT tell us what this orbiter Did?  someone we haven't heard from yet
        - Can you explain to us, or is the function of the microscope
        - So, you know, wish and use a microscope to look closely on the water right but we can find the water first, and then, then we can look at the water closer later
        - I mean, what did the scientist call the small machine?
        - Can you explain more about the small machine, what tell us more about what the machine is
        - Oh, you have a problem here
        - Maybe it was through the thing about the questions, the scientists used the microscope or to discover water or observing the water left out
        - Do you think of which one to
        - and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there
        - Yes, so did you'll find a place in the passage, you can do that
        - Teacher : Yeah, so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things
        - So microscopic means it's really small,
        - Teacher : Would you like to reread the article?
        - Teacher : Did you hear the name of the equipment that they used this can go to STUDENT
        - So that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - So let's read
        - Number three, so that we can kind of make an understanding of this
        - Teacher : Is the water on the moon, big or small
        - Teacher : Right, so it's small, so it's saying
        - It's very small
        - And what does a microscope do
        - So do you think we could look at the water that's really small
        - So, let us look at things that are really small
        - Do you see a sentence that starts with NASA sent
        - Teacher : Right, so where in the article
        - Do you remember
        - What was that small machine name
        - So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do
        - But so Chris and STUDENT, so that they found the two tools of equipment right so
        - Did it help find the water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at both pieces of equipment
        - So the was the microscope
        - So you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right
        - STUDENT Can you summarize what the paragraph said
        - What did NASA do
        - How about that, who can answer that first question
        - So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence
        - It says they sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So that was step one
        - So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there
        - I'm sorry, the water is microscopic so it's tiny
        - And they even explain to us, it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it
        - So what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small
        - So the moon is so the water that they found
        - So the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - And microscopes to investigate the small tight, the smallest or I'm sorry, the water that was found this tiny
        - What do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's see, paragraph number two, where we found out about the lunar orbiter that Jazmin's discussing
        - So I the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water
        - However, it does say that
        - Um, so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon
        - So, so I'm looking at, paragraph two, right now it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there, however, that small machine was still necessary because that's what found The ice deposits
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater
        - So that's what actually found the small little water so that I can and I found that information from the second sentence
        - Right, so then with the microscope in paragraph three, it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope When they were examining it back here on Earth
        - So we're in the process to reread it
        - Yes, I want you to skim the text and let me know which Equipment
        - In particular, they used to discover to make this discovery
        - Paragraph two NASA sent to be small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - It wasn't used to discover the actual water
        - Yep, so you, you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right
        - but on what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out loud
        - The three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon
        - And I want STUDENT to be listening
        - So I want STUDENT to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out
        - Water on the moon, because in these three facts that I'm going to read out there will be some answers in there
        - Then they use the microscope to see it
        - They did so once they actually found the water
        - Does that make more sense
        - So they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water
        - Do you know we just read about it
        - You want me to read it again
        - Oh yeah, I think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon
        - Um, in that sentence
        - Can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does
        - It goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does
        - So now what I want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon
        - But what was, what was this water like, was it like like a cup of water
        - Or like, What state was this water found in?
        - Yeah so wasn't just water
        - It was ice
        - So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon
        - So the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic
        - What do you think
        - So when you think of microscopic
        - So if we're thinking about the water found on the moon
        - Are we thinking about, like,
        - Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water
        - So even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater, but the ice deposits are little
        - When you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice
        - The, the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find
        - Let's look a little bit closer at the reading
        - So I'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph, not the paragraph
        - Okay, so the part that I'm going direct us to is
        - Where it says, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - What do you think it talks about what's the main thing
        - We just picture like giant things
        - So when we picture craters
        - Did they give a name for what the machine was called
        - And do we know what craters are
        - Yeah, I'm looking in the text now and I see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines
        - That was a great description
        - So if we look back in our text
        - Maybe someone can read from the text
        - If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon
        - So do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water, they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it
        - The text says if you look straight at it, we wouldn't be able to see it
        - Do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So I'm STUDENT is right
        - That is kind of funny
        - I think that um STUDENT, you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent
        - I don't see that either
        - But now that I'm reading the text just like STUDENT said I din't pick up on this before either
        - To look at the moon, they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so
        - It doesn't look like There was an astronaut
        - That article had a lot of detail about what that's STUDENT machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon
        - Before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water
        - So the first thing that the scientists did was investigate, they needed to investigate the Moon before they could even go in and see anything else
        - So I think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the Moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water
        - So it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water
        - Yes, but let me ask you a further question
        - Could they just send a microscope to space and find water
        - Or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water
        - They use some sort of other equipment
        - Well, so if we refer back to the text I do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water, but before they get a microscope
        - So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon
        - Do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text
        - And so, STUDENT, did they send astronauts
        - So what did they send
        - And so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon
        - But first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon
        - I want you to think of how, what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon
        - Once scientists are on the moon
        - They use more equipment even more to make more discoveries
        - So I want you to think of what a scientist does throughout STUDENT of the processes
        - And think of what different kinds of tools
        - But there's a certain Tool and I want us to go back in the text and find where it says, um, that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment, um, to investigate the water on the moon
        - you do need a microscope to find the part, the particles of water that they found  Because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it
        - Yeah, I'm NASA did send a small machine
        - Do you remember what that small machine was called
        - Can you read that out loud for us, where
        - Can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence
        - You might be able to bring us to the right answer
        - But when we go back and read the text
        - It was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water
        - That was what was used, so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like STUDENT said they used a microscope
        - Let me go back
        - So if we go back and the text
        - Number three, paragraph three, the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water
        - Can someone identify the name of that small machine
        - Who can tell me the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate
        - Now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it
        - But the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky
        - Because we might think it could be the microscope, because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered
        - It's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon
        - Because the moon is is really dry
        - It is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water
        - I'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that information but in a connection to the text and the question
        - That is true
        - They do use a lot of equipment
        - We have to think about the equipment that is used to discover water on the moon
        - But to identify the water they use a microscope
        - What's going on with this water
        - And what about water on the moon
        - And what could the hydrogen
        - Alright, and Oliver I see you circled the same as well, so we can address both of you, together here, so can STUDENT, can you tell me what does a microscope do
        - Yes, that's an excellent point I think here in the text, what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay
        - because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters
        - So that's a good point there
        - Because they find this water, it has too tiny that we can, we have to use this micro me with this microscope
        - You have to use a microscope
        - In order to see the water, you have to see
        - but can you remember how that small machine was called?
        - That's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water
        - The first thing that they send, and when they discovered this, I let me see the number
        - So that was it
        - Then after that, they use the microscope carries and being
        - When these discovered this tiny water
        - Yeah, just see this tiny water
        - In the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts
        - A robot doesn't need oxygen to survive
        - They send that they just sent the Lunar Orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot
        - Yeah, it was able to explore or the craters around it, then the moon
        - And find these little amount of water in there
        - First of STUDENT, let's think about these texts
        - So can you tell me where are the main idea of this text
        - And let's think about the main ideas of these texts
        - But so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text
        - Okay, so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about
        - What is the other main idea that we can learn
        - So what do you think about that
        - Yeah, I'm talking about
        - So can you tell me what is it, what is in the microscope for
        - And also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right
        - Yeah, so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water, but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water
        - So we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning
        - Can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot?
        - Okay so they found  this equipment to discover water on the moon
        - What happened next
        - So when they discover water on the moon
        - What is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters?
        - After that, they have to
        - They have to make an observation
        - And how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can, they, they will need to observe this water
        - Um, what do you use the microscope for?
        - So can you tell me what is the main
        - When you think of a desert
        - Do you think of what do you think, what do you see
        - Yeah I noticed that you didn't
        - You didn't mention any water
        - So what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits
        - What do you think that might mean
        - Yeah, it doesn't say that
        - But if we read between the lines that I'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope
        - Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer
        - So we're focusing on how they found the sample
        - Yeah, in order to see it, you would need to but first they have, they have to find the sample to look at
        - Can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample?
        - So how did they find those ice deposits
        - Can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first
        - Then, what, what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to
        - What exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon
        - Um, I wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon
        - I wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there
        - Um, what other functions, water has
        - And to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon
        - But we're looking for
        - Does STUDENT remember what that's called
        - This is this specific name of that machine
        - Can you STUDENT just remind me
        - And can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does
        - What did they use it for just
        - So like you said
        - They said the small machine
        - So that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it
        - Well, that's a great point
        - So the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate
        - So we need to use that piece of technology to find the water
        - Where's the, where's the water exactly on the moon
        - What part of the moon
        - So yes, that they're in these big craters
        - The large polar craters, but the so the ice deposits are in the creators
        - So we need to use that scientific tool called, like you said, a microscope to look at the water really closely
        - It's very, very, very small
        - So, they, they, the scientists, they go into the moon and they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters
        - So again, great
        - And then there's a microscopic amount of water, super, super, super, super small
        - Like, what STUDENT their first answer using the microscope
        - Think about a desert
        - The, the text itself
        - When you think about the climate of the moon
        - They need to use a microscope to be able to see the water, the small amounts of water
        - So again, if you if you're thinking about now going forward
        - Said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on Earth
        - So when you think of like the feeling of the moon
        - Think of that
        - It feels like a desert
        - That's something that can help you remember this information
        - So even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert
        - Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right?
        - Yeah, so it says
        - It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter
        - I think someone mentioned that great piece of information
        - That was in that was in lunar craters
        - And the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water
        - They might have had to use a microscope, because there's such small amounts of water
        - So even when they got there with the Lunar Orbiter
        - Was there any other equipment that was used in the text
        - Okay, tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about
        - and see the exact name like if STUDENT can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water, how you talk over it for about two minutes
        - See um well I do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but
        - they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water, since it was so small
        - and now, what about you STUDENT did you, you know learn anything new from this paragraph, I know you love space, but you know
        - yeah cool and how are you deaf did you, you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use
        - yeah well that's you know I think that's kind of like the bigger question here, I think the orbiter was part of the first step, they had the thought I wonder if there's water on the moon, they sent the orbiter to kind of you know
        - Just do the initial discovery or initial I guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal, and what
        - You know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water, so I think they you know they both work together
        - and STUDENT, looking at the text, can you explain what the Lunar orbiter did?
        - So there seems like there's two steps to this right? there's first the investigation period with the Lunar orbiter and
        - cool so that's kind of, what do we think STUDENT? that's kind of the first step
        - STUDENT can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process
        - STUDENT, can you kind of explain - it seems like there's two parts, Do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the Lunar orbiter and the microscope
        - Can you explain to the STUDENT, you know how those two work together?
        - The potential uses of water? Was that exciting? or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon?
        - Did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful
        - So they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so I guess you did say that the they found craters full of water, and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits
        - and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water, you or I would drink in a day, so you know actually I like the spirit, you know you tried to answer the question, but unfortunately
        - and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah
        - A moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water
        - And I know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery
        - yeah can you remind me what that was called
        - awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water
        - Okay um in the text, what did they What were they using the microscope for?
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine
        - What was that machine called?
        - yeah and what was the purpose of that machine, so we had a small machine, it was called the Lunar orbiter What did it do what was the purpose of it?
        - Can someone tell me what that word was again? there was one word that described the water -how how much water there was
        - Okay, so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water
        - um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right?
        - The ice deposits in the moon were very small right, so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say? Can someone actually answer this for me in the text, when we were reading it um What did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon?
        - Yes, a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so Harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water, we can see that but can someone describe how the water
        - Why did they need a microscope, why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah STUDENT
        - so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but
        - So when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon, and then does STUDENT know the definition of orbiter or orbit can anyone share that with me
        - Exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right, so that is the equipment that NASA send or scientist sent to the moon
        - And it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here, you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is
        - Not on the moon surface, how do you guys imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does anyone know that STUDENT
        - When astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know, be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe
        - And so you know, going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon, is that you know they actually
        - Implemented a really interesting strategy, they basically threw a piece of the Atlas rocket at the moon
        - Yeah they did, and this caused a big crash
        - That sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then, as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air, you know circling the moon
        - And it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume, and this is where your points STUDENT comes in
        - Which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5% water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play
        - You know, to Chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment, because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the Lunar orbiter the equipment and the STUDENT what's up
        - Oh, my gosh yes you're absolutely right so
        - But it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely
        - You wouldn't even know that it was there, why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to
        - you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead STUDENT
        - Exactly, so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon, and that actually brings up a fantastic point about
        - can anybody share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead STUDENT
        - So they use a not use a little
        - Water and moon by, but you can only look at in the human eye, so we just go look at your day I we weren't able to see it and
        - Very scientific tool to
        - yeah so that's quite I mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them
        - before they found that water What were they what tools, were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground
        - yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts, but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there
        - And I think when we hear the word NASA we our minds automatically are like Oh, we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what I think of at least I think of an astronaut
        - But lately, especially NASA has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment, like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines, the Lunar orbiters STUDENT that you helped us find
        - And they have been able to send those things in space, instead of just people
        - You don't know so i'm going to read you STUDENT, paragraph three, and then I would love to hear you guys I would love to hear if you guys think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it
        - Yes, that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right, so the water they found is super tiny, and if they want to see it, they would need to look really close with a microscope right
        - The lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do STUDENT
        - so friends, what about other than just helping astronauts breathe, what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for?
        - um Oliver and Farrah and Chris you STUDENT read the fourth paragraph right What did you guys think could be useful, there are, what did that tell you about the water
        - So I want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something STUDENT the way out into space Using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon?
        - Do you STUDENT think it would be helpful If we already had if we didn't have to Make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us, do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too
        - What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily
        - Based on what you read, could you maybe tell me how they found the water, what did they use to find the water
        - A small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences STUDENT, what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was
        - yeah Chris that's exactly right, so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission, but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome, thank you for sharing that with me Chris, that was a great job let's see STUDENT
        - yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands, how many of you have used a microscope before
        - yeah right so in depth, maybe our friend, can you share with you some of their experiences, but like you said STUDENT microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them
        - Right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water
        - mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was
        - A big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does
        - That is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water, but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound
        - mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks, because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what
        - To breathe exactly, and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does STUDENT know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us
        - Are you hearing person what is water, made up of
        - that's right h2o does STUDENT know what he stands for
        - Exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water, because if they find water, then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - to fuel the rockets, or they can use it to help us breathe so STUDENT that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - You know what I think that's right dead and my research, I actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon
        - So that's where I found that extra knowledge and maybe I could even share that video with you STUDENT some time to it seems like something you might be interested in
        - But, based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text, so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question
        - yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case, does STUDENT remember reading that
        - Well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah STUDENT you can
        - The robot that STUDENT was mentioning for them, the small machine
        - What tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon
        - When you STUDENT read this article, what did you guys think was the most interesting parts of it?
        - I wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water, right?
        - Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own
        - Did the did the NASA astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon, on its own?
        - yeah so STUDENT, why was the small machine so important in this example?
        - What kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at?
        - Okay, so in our article that we had, talking about water on the moon, I agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found
        - I agree that is very difficult, but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope, how do we get the water?
        - Very good what's this small machine called?
        - So we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon, when the microscope is used to dis-
        - Right, can you tell me what a desert is?
        - Right right a desert is really dry, so if we're saying the moon, is a desert, what are we saying there's not a lot of there?
        - So in this text, we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon, why do you guys think they needed to use equipment, why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands? Go ahead STUDENT
        - that's a great idea what type of equipment, do you think they would need to look at water
        - Have you ever used a microscope STUDENT
        - yeah right, so what type of other equipment, do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water
        - Is there something else that they maybe brought?
        - Do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem?
        - So coming back to you Farrah so STUDENT helped you out, you pointed out this small machine
        - Why would you need a microscope according to that sentence, what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence
        - Okay, so keep going so you were reading, paragraph two, and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the Lunar orbiter is for
        - Yes, and then What else does the Lunar orbiter do
        - And what it's investigating is what STUDENT shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit, what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits
        - So what can the Lunar orbiter help us find
        - So when I say go you STUDENT are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself, look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon
        - You do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what I was looking at the words STUDENT around microscope
        - And that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry, excuse me, does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon
        - Is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is
        - Is there a difference between you would need and
        - So do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read
        - That would be referring to us, we would need a microscope
        - So maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water
        - And what is the Lunar orbiter look for
        - And what is ice
        - The scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it, maybe they would have to use a microscope
        - And then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits
        - Now ice, what is ice I guess
        - These craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope
        - yeah well um I guess it's implied here that the Lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits
        - and they so we're looking for something with NASA right or scientists right, where it says scientists use or NASA used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are NASA right
        - So we would need a microscope
        - Oh, and what is a microscope
        - What are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for
        - Has STUDENT seen a microscope before
        - And what do you use them for in science STUDENT
        - wow that's awesome and what kind of things, do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon, or the water, the frozen water
        - So, going back to the article, and now that we know about the microscope
        - What can you tell me about the machine that NASA sent to the moon? The lunar orbiter
        - Oh great, and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like I don't know anything about the ice crater so I need you to explain it to me oh
        - But how would you describe an ice crater if
        - I know they're deep their dark they have ice in them
        - What do you think they look like?
        - but are they like the grand Canyon like deep holes in the ground
        - yeah so it's a, it is a hole off the ground, it's kind of elevated
        - What else did you learn about the moon from the article
        - And what is a microscope
        - And why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon
        - So how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article
        - So NASA sent a small machine, why did they send the machine?
        - Okay, well, do you think you could tell me what the microscope does?
        - And how it relates to finding water
        - Like Why were they using a microscope to look at the water? What were they were hoping to find?
        - Because it's about trying to find water on the moon
        - Ok, well why do you think they were going there to look for water?
        - yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope?
        - So how do we, have you ever used the microscope before
        - Right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not
        - So what do you think help the scientists
        - And I don't want you to answer it now, I want you to take a second to look through the text again, but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it
        - How can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right, because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for STUDENT these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time, so we have to look at the text
        - The goal is to pro right so similar to my um NASA with the microscope when they have the microscope It means that they're looking at something very specific right
        - But there's a situation there's something that they have to do, prior to that to where it's very broad, so your answer was was
        - yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the Lunar orbiter and, if you look inside the word lunar where do you see
        - cool great so we see the word Luna or moon Thank you STUDENT inside of lunar I also want to think about the word polar craters what word, do you see inside of the word polar
        - Okay, and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of STUDENT
        - uh huh and so, if we're looking at polar craters on the moon, where are they going to be located
        - What is it telling us STUDENT, I appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away
        - Okay, and what is inside of the creators STUDENT
        - What are we learning from this paragraph
        - Great so, can you tell me more about what the Lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing
        - So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two
        - What is NASA specifically sending in paragraph to
        - To do what STUDENT
        - Good so i'm going to add that, to my visualization I know NASA which STUDENT knows so much about
        - amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together
        - The water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water
        - In the sentence STUDENT read, are the scientists, what are they using the microscope for?
        - Thank you STUDENT for reading from the text
        - So now we have two ideas on the table: that it was a microscope or this small machine
        - Um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine? STUDENT you have a hand up
        - What is the small machine called? let's give it a name
        - But before, before you look at the water closely, how did NASA say that they found they could find the water on the moon?
        - Can you think of, can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water?
        - Right, so I think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon
        - Did STUDENT catch what it was called?
        - mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's South pole
        - So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters
        - But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample
        - right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it
        - so let's listen why don't you jump in STUDENT is the would you say the moon is dry, or is the moon wet, what do you think
        - That are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water, they have not found just lots of water in the moon, the moon is one of the driest places in the world
        - Yes, I love that you brought the grand Canyon because that's honestly how I picture the moon, sometimes, because the moon, is very dry dry place but, just like the grand Canyon
        - When we go there  we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice, so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place
        - Yes, you're right right, so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know, maybe you guys have used microscopes in your STUDENT before
        - and so, with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to STUDENT what they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - Yes, you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have Like the oxygen like we breathe in the air, they don't have that on the moon
        - Who could give me a quick summary of the text? two to three sentences
        - Alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read
        - Okay, can you tell me how they found it
        - I want STUDENT to think, and then you're going to get a chance to vote: is it a microscope that found the water on the moon, or is it the Lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon
        - Okay, and STUDENT you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon
        - Okay, so i'm noticing STUDENT that you are looking to, you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really, really small, and that is absolutely right
        - Is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool
        - Okay, so STUDENT just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate
        - I want STUDENT to go back to Part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water
        - and then it also talks about, later in the text, the microscope
        - and as STUDENT pointed out, it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits, where the water was, right
        - so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found
        - and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small
        - lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off
        - All the actually says very clear in the second paragraph, can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as NASA sent the small machine and what is that called STUDENT
        - Good and that was the outcome right, we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon, which is really fascinating
        - The answer is located in a paragraph two, and it's not too difficult and because it says NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate right and
        - yeah and then it was confusing at first, because, as you said, it is a small machine
        - That I love that question and then what it does, that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment, but they use it to
        - And I can tell you that, because it tells you directly in the paragraph to
        - And the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water, so I know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay
        - So what was that small machine called
        - Because what did the Lunar orbiter do
        - Did you STUDENT watch the movie about how the Lunar orbiter worked
        - Okay, so Are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry, are they telling us, we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small, we would need a microscope
        - that's I mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you, you need to use to find something that is very small
        - But if we look, does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon, or that the water is kind of buried underneath
        - I want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and, if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you I would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time
        - Great job Thank you so I noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is
        - yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water, it sounds like that's what happened in this article
        - It also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn STUDENT of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon
        - So take a look at the second paragraph, read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again
        - We know it's a small machine, but if my machine could be anything, how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is
        - STUDENT Thank you so much for sharing that Luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon,
        - just like now is the Lunar New Year it's the complete cycle of the moon
        - orbiter just like STUDENT said, has to do with going around
        - if you look back in your text, you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater
        - STUDENT could you tell your classmates How was it that they found that there was water on the moon
        - And STUDENT did the machine which is called the Lunar orbiter, by the way, did that have a microscope on it
        - They they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the Lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon, making contact with that part of the moon
        - What what's that step in between so STUDENT, can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the Lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that Farrah
        - Why is it called the Lunar lunar orbiter, by the way, why, why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but STUDENT
        - cool that that's exactly the two pieces of equipment that they mentioned in the article So what does the Lunar orbiter do
        - let's let's take a step back STUDENT What did you get what What did you get from this article what what did this article tell you, especially you know you're our in house space expert
        - For you, you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article
        - Yes, you could you could definitely say that they sent to lunar orbiter to investigate and what exactly why did they have to send the Lunar orbiter what what's the purpose of the Lunar orbiter and what what is it really besides, a small machine
        - STUDENT, how did you feel about this article, and what what sense, did you get from it
        - You know, being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon, the natural resources, like the water that was recently found
        - really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time, you know the technology and the science does not exist, to be able to do this yet
        - is there, something else is, is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money, in particular, that you see in the art in paragraph six
        - that's right they don't and and so, since they don't know what would they have to do to be able to get it out
        - that's right that's right and now, so why does that, why does building new equipment How does that tie together to time and money
        - in the text, they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really, really tiny
        - And the water molecules on the moon were really tiny STUDENT I saw your hand go up earlier, did you have something to add
        - yeah they did I remember reading that as well does STUDENT remember what it was called
        - Has STUDENT heard those words before
        - Do you know what they mean, you know what lunar means?
        - Yes, it does and what what does something do when it orbits
        - Exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah STUDENT do you have something to add
        - So the Lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles, but the water particles are microscopic they're really, really tiny, so the scientist has to use the microscope as well, to be able to see them
        - yeah that's a great clarifying question I was a little unclear as well, but from what I understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon, and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used
        - the equipment to find the water
        - They might have been on the space station, or something that was also in space, but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work
        - Maybe look in your text it says it in the
        - Do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment
        - Very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah
        - what does that make?
        - Oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you STUDENT remember reading the article, the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen
        - so what kind of a
        - how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope
        - Okay, so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits, and can you make a connection to the microscope now STUDENT
        - And it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic
        - Right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean? Now that they found water on the moon, what can happen up there?
        - Or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day?
        - Well, what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do STUDENT you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it, what do you
        - No, so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph, so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph? STUDENT
        - A small machine will, what was the name of the small machine
        - Why do they need to microscope again?
        - So let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it, and then they can use the microscope to see it
        - mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter
        - yeah great and, what is this machine for?
        - yeah and that's how this little machine, the small machine works right?
        - What do you think? How the Lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits?
        - STUDENT, can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter?
        - Why don't we look at it STUDENT together right now
        - yeah it looks into craters
        - Why do you think we call it an orbiter?
        - STUDENT, do you know why they call it an orbiter?
        - Yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater
        - STUDENT, what do you want to say?
        - and the Lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right?
        - And they they used STUDENT that over a course of you know, probably many months, and they and they somehow found
        - I'm curious STUDENT, do you remember any actual equipment that they use
        - Do you remember how they found the water in those craters
        - Water in those craters which is really exciting, because when I was your age, we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere
        - Have you ever used the microscope before
        - Mike, their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into
        - yeah awesome so I guess what i'm wondering is, if you have to use the microscope and you, you have that already have something available to put on those slides
        - And so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to STUDENT
        - And then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet
        - This small machine, so we've talked about other machines, but I think she's thinking about the one that actually like got
        - and see what you can find, see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started
        - What are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words ,but what what is the Lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean? STUDENT
        - Maybe this machine, the small machine this lunar orbiter as STUDENT said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon
        - But that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon, and not actually going in the crater how, how does it find the ice it's in the crater
        - STUDENT do you have any thoughts on that
        - In the large polar crater
        - Remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the North Pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the Lunar orbiter works right
        - that's good and Chris it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again, it is on spaces eaten pointed out, which I find super exciting STUDENT find super exciting
        - You wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,
        - Yes, exactly Oliver awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what STUDENT talked about
        - Why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon
        - Okay, so your answer may not, that is not necessarily wrong, what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean, can you explain
        - really, really, really small, so we do need a special tool and that special tool
        - detectives right and so detected they look for things right, and so that's pretty much what the what NASA wanted to do they wanted to send this small
        - This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um STUDENT else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important
        - yeah definitely they have to use all those things right, why do you STUDENT think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space
        - right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right, and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space
        - um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine, why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one
        - okay Nice nice So what do we use a microscope for
        - yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong I love again how you use the, how you use the word microscope, um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example, when we use a microscope
        - it's full of these craters that have the water in them right, but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right,
        - or can STUDENT else help us out, they did find these, They did find these craters right
        - Right um so yeah NASA they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine, maybe um
        - can STUDENT think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate
        - In this context, it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool, or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering
        - Is that the robot that searched on the planet, can you read that whole section again for me
        - awesome what did you find in that sentence
        - What is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter
        - Great so what was that part of the text telling us
        - That was used to discover water on the moon, and I want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was Hughes to discover water on the moon
        - right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water
        - Okay, so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope
        - What if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at NASA figured out that there is water on the moon, which is super exciting What would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents, based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery
        - The story is that when when the satellite went up there, they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume Do you know what a plume is
        - Right, so they they hypothesized, but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume, then we can send our we can send
        - And you can you can you see the text, right now, Oliver do you look at the can STUDENT see the tax that i'm talking about
        - Right, so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water
        - awesome so STUDENT, can you tell me what the small machine was called?
        - awesome so this small machine was called the Lunar orbiter- STUDENT, what did NASA do with that machine?
        - yeah does STUDENT know what investigate means?
        - yeah awesome STUDENT and that's exactly what investigate means so NASA used the Lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water
        - Thank you Luis so STUDENT I haven't heard your voice in a while Farrah does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used?
        - yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned
        - Oh awesome he found it in part three
        - um let's unpack that a bit So what is the small machine do
        - What is it investigating for what are we looking for and
        - yeah that's a really great detail, you found so STUDENT based off of that evidence, are we swimming and large bodies of water, what are we looking for
        - It might not be like full bodies of water, but we have ice right and what does ice made out of
        - Exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for
        - Oh that's interesting, so we have equipment, both in Part Two and part three So what does that mean, how many pieces of equipment are we looking at
        - yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right, but in order to find the location, with the water, what are we using
        - Exactly, so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what
        - yeah exactly so we take that ice right we take, we find the water particles and we want to use that in the future so that we can go to the moon, and we could stay there long periods of time and and STUDENT going back to you and how you know so much about
        - Space and STUDENT that, what do we need for oxygen takes
        - Yet, so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of
        - And what does the a stamp or what is the O stands for
        - Great, so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there
        - Alright, so you have the word equipment, but let's take it one step further, what specific piece of equipment is being used
        - STUDENT right, what is the oxygen tank being used for
        - The small machine, what is this machine
        - Okay, is there a name of the specific machine there that you found STUDENT
        - Does STUDENT have that in the in the question, what was this equipment, helping them to do
        - So what do you think is this ice deposits refer to? STUDENT
        - Okay, so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence: this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater
        - However, if we take a look a sentence earlier, like the water they found is microscopic
        - So here, the word microscopic, could you please use another word to replace it? So what which word would you use, STUDENT?
        - So what does this mean is that the water that we can find currently on the moon is really tiny it's really limited
        - tiny yeah that's great so microscopic here means tiny
        - It doesn't mean that we use the tool named the microscope to find it, but the water we find is very microscopic, which means it is very limited and tiny
        - But here in this paragraph, they just name one, so what is the one equipment, if you look at the first sentence
        - yeah Thank you that's great So here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could STUDENT tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph? So what is this function?
        - yeah, this is a really good answer, so the machine is used to find where on the moon the water is
        - Well let's see the water they found is microscopic you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so let's see if we can make an inference who can tell me what influences
        - Does anyone know what the differences yeah go ahead STUDENT
        - that's exactly right so an inference is when we use the clues that the text is giving us
        - If we know that first they use the Lunar orbiter to investigate and find those ice deposits, they found the water in those craters just like STUDENT said in his response
        - And then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope
        - Absolutely, I think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration, but I think that, from the text we can make an inference that says First they go with the Lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes
        - But I'm wondering, Farrah could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with NASA in the moon is a desert and STUDENT while, while she's reading, could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water?
        - Go ahead, STUDENT
        - Well, or we could STUDENT, so we could all look for what tool NASA uses to help discover
        - What were they doing, what were they using?
        - Excellent STUDENT Thank you so much
        - So STUDENT, what what kind of tool were they using there? they were they were looking for water
        - I wonder if you could, I wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two
        - ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of, even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is, we're kind of making some guesses right? So what do you think it's a small, we know it's a small machine and STUDENT, what else do we know about it now?
        - yeah, what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater?
        - Okay, so STUDENT would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do
        - So a microscope is a tool that does what
        - and um and I i'm curious if any of you STUDENT um can pinpoint that a little more closer in the text okay so
        - On and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called
        - and you had written
        - NASA send a small machine which is true in paragraph to it describes it as being a small machine, but then right after it says it's a small machine it says called and I feel like we need to focus on that word, because what does NASA call small machine in the paragraph
        - that's a really good point STUDENT and I I think what they used the Lunar orbiter for was to investigate where there might be the deposits of water
        - um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def
        - Yes, I think that's a really great way of putting it, it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be, and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah STUDENT
        - Then yeah STUDENT those other cool machines come into play, after the fact, after they're able to find the water
        - The sure do they sure do and STUDENT of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and I think that it's this part where it says they sent the Lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that
        - Yes, I love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine
        - Yes, and STUDENT I think you might know the answer to this, but what what did they use to look at the ice
        - I think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts
        - yeah, I think, so I actually don't know I think it's possible that the Lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it, and then it was STUDENT done with robots but that's a great question
        - mm hmm yeah so when we're thinking about what kinds of machines, they were using the right answers that they were using two different kinds of machines
        - Yes, perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for
        - Because the article does say a little bit more about what that small machine actually is there's a name for it so
        - but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article
        - To find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text
        - What did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you
        - huh yeah definitely So do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that, from the passage
        - do you know what a lunar orbiter is
        - mm hmm and let's Maybe you can think a little bit, we can break down that nate, and so do you know what lunar means
        - yeah Thank you you're right yeah and then or better does STUDENT know what the word orbiter means or the orbit
        - yeah definitely so STUDENT now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on
        - How do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water
        - What is the actual name of the small machine
        - STUDENT you said masters kind of small machine, could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called
        - The lunar orbiter now does STUDENT have an idea what the Lunar orbiter is
        - STUDENT, what did those scientists fine, could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter
        - So how much water did they find could use to find in the text, how much water they found
        - microscopic the me thank you for finding that can STUDENT tell me what microscopic me
        - Where they're using the microscope again
        - Okay, you can put your hands down Thank you just tracking it's Okay, if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon, yes STUDENT oh
        - that connects to something STUDENT said earlier, I think about the oxygen tanks, could you tell could Luis could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank
        - But something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why I don't think astronauts are on this mission
        - that's a good notice you just said so, even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section, we can only assume what they tell us, but let's keep that in mind, just in case they mention it later yes
        - Did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is
        - and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means
        - Yes, and I really liked how many supers you use because they have to zoom and even though, as STUDENT said the craters very big the amount of water, they can find is very, very small
        - But if they're already on the moon, they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so
        - take a closer look back at the text and it says in the second paragraph NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate so thinking about that, I think that STUDENT might be correct that the who would be NASA at least from reading through that sentence
        - Thank you, wonderful so you guys read about scientists and the moon, and can STUDENT tell me what did they discover?
        - Does anyone remember what word they use to describe how small the water i? STUDENT
        - I think that there's a word for that
        - Yes, very good the scientists
        - And what did they find? I think we STUDENT know, this one
        - Very good, and how did they find it? We know that the water was microscopic, it was very small, but what what type of tool did they use to find it? STUDENT mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water, but what what i'm what type of invention, it was it had a really cool name
        - Does STUDENT know what paragraph maybe that they named the small machine in?
        - So you mentioned a small machine
        - Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter
        - And, and so, when I reading paragraph two, it says that they sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - But we also know that later in paragraph three, paragraph three, it says that, where is it, the water they found was microscopic
        - that's a really cool insight and I really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our STUDENT, but my question is, is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what Oliverice they used to find the water on the moon
        - Was there a spot in the text, talking about what Oliverice things to find the water on the moon?
        - yeah so that's a really good addition Thank you yeah I see that in paragraph three, it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water
        - that's a really good question um but let's take a look at paragraph three let's see what it says
        - So you're right, we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering, maybe, if we take a look at paragraph two is, are there any other tools that the scientists were using
        - Can you read it to the to our STUDENT so we're we're on the same page
        - Thank you for reading um yeah so you're right, so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so you're right, it is a small machine, but what is the tool, called the specific tool used
        - However, I want us to take a look at the reading specifically
        - But not STUDENT else has that but what everyone else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again
        - yeah that they both do sound pretty good and that's why we're talking about it so let's take a look at that sentence, again, the one that STUDENT read aloud
        - So NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate So what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for
        - yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water So what do we think is the Lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing
        - But my question coming after this would be what did they use this microscope for and STUDENT can answer this question, using the tax and using our discussion, what did the scientists use the microscope to do
        - so we already identified that in paragraph three there's a microscope as a tool can STUDENT find a tool in paragraph two
        - yeah So what do we think is the function of the Lunar orbiter in this paragraph
        - it's looking for ice
        - Okay, great so you talked about a scientific tool called a microscope, can you tell me a little bit about what they use the microscope to look at
        - yeah great response, they use a microscope to look at the small small specks of water exactly have you ever used a microscope before
        - Oh great can you guys raise your hand if any of you have used a microscope dub Chris Jazmin or STUDENT
        - I just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for
        - yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon, to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer STUDENT do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text, see if you can find some evidence
        - And we learned a bit about how this is a really big endeavor so there wasn't just one piece of equipment that scientists use there's actually many pieces of equipment and tools
        - That you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe, help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water
        - Okay, so oxygen tanks is a really important tool, like you had mentioned earlier, obviously, they would not be able to breathe, give me one second okay i'm just gonna ask STUDENT a quick question
        - So STUDENT Maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for, I think it was in the maybe the second paragraph
        - So what STUDENT just said, was in the third paragraph and she's talking about the tool called a microscope
        - Does STUDENT want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic
        - yeah that's awesome so if we think about what we already know from the text we've got this thing called a lunar orbiter
        - And so, has STUDENT here ever seen or used a microscope before
        - awesome STUDENT, do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope
        - yeah that's awesome thanks STUDENT, I always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that, like we use our eyes to see everything around us, but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about
        - can you tell us now that you just read that sentence again what was the name of that machine
        - They might need tools from a traditional toolbox as well i'm sure they need lots of different things as they do their exploration on the moon
        - yeah and so when we're talking about this specific article in what the scientists need to find water on the moon, it looks like we've got these two different components here the microscope because those water molecules are super duper tiny
        - And then we've got that lunar orbiter as another piece of equipment, what do you think that they were using that lunar orbiter for
        - Chris that sounds like a little bit of your answer, what do you STUDENT think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon?
        - yeah great and so I saw that as well, what STUDENT do you think that, according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen
        - STUDENT part of what you read said future astronauts could drink this water, so I think right now we're still in this like hypothetical state where we're thinking
        - Okay, what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text
        - Oh OK, so to look really closely at what
        - Oh okay these ice has a very small So what did we think what did we
        - What do we think of of what Jazmin just read so she said NASA send a small machine and what was the machine can STUDENT tell me
        - Ah, OK so lunar orbiter do we think that might be the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Oh OK, so the water they found is microscopic so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay so yeah they use that I guess choose so that is also evidence of the text that we can use to answer this question um
        - So, I guess, they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely
        - yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then, how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that STUDENT found in the text
        - that word means that the water is small and you cannot just directly see it,
        - Okay, good so um, can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter?
        - what is a microscope and what does it do for us
        - And Oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight
        - Good good and Harry, can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water
        - Oh you're so well, what does that small machine do can STUDENT look at paragraph two, and tell me what is that small machine do
        - hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice, because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her Jazmin's question, yes, there
        - and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon So where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place, yes hairs
        - Yes, very good, why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen
        - Yes, very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water
        - and then, what do you need to see the the water itself
        - Endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it
        - um yeah I don't think there's astronauts in the story so far
        - yeah, we can see in the third paragraph to see the eyes is very small, so we need the microscope to look at it
        - A small machine washing machine with that machine called
        - yeah you do really great job, so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the Lunar orbiter fine
        - yeah great the Lunar orbiter buying the eyes departed in Apollo crater right
        - yeah so how did I get the water STUDENT
        - So we know that the scientists used equipment, so now I want us to think about our responses, yet, but STUDENT
        - You have full so that takes us to the understanding what does microscopic actually mean
        - It is it's STUDENT so you're onto something, but what does microscopic mean
        - so you had the right answer about a small machine, but then after they find the they found the ice deposits, they had to use something else to like look at it more closely
        - ice deposits in lunar craters, but if it's too small to see with the eyes, they have to go in with that microscope to try to find
        - yeah that's what the microscopes for
        - yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely
        - So there's still people controlling it it's just from earth, so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do
        - Exactly, and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope
        - So, in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um
        - But is there, another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um
        - Right okay so that's assumption
        - Is that the amount of water that
        - is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day
        - yeah so in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, so the microscope was a really good answer, but the microscope is just looking at the water
        - At the bottom of the crater just that little bit, whereas the Lunar orbiter was sent to the moon, to look at it STUDENT and investigate everything does that make sense
        - Instead of just the water at the bottom
        - You fuel, do you STUDENT know what that is
        - rocket fuel is how you would how you would move the spaceship so it's like
        - it's like how i'm gas as for our car
        - it's the same thing
        - Right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided STUDENT
        - Well, once they get to the moon, they would drink the water on the moon, so I mean
        - i'm sure that they bring, maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each, but I think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water, because that's really happy, but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring
        - mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right
        - Well, yours is correct, but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text
        - yeah so they didn't just use one thing they used
        - In the beginning that they use a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then
        - Towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the
        - Right yeah because it's cold so good good So these are STUDENT great clues that we all help on fighting together,
        - And what I want you guys to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two, and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so STUDENT have a question before we get started
        - Right so there's more there's more to that What else does it say about the small machine
        - that's a fantastic question and that's why there's another tool that had to be used in order to find it
        - To be honest, i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article, to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something
        - You might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource
        - And I also wonder if some equipment is used for some jobs in space and some different equipment is used for different jobs, so I wonder if looking for water on the moon requires some different different equipment than some of the things that you're talking about
- intent: r210.3
  examples: |
        - Farrah and STUDENT are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first
        - but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one
        - awesome so STUDENT how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information
        - Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope STUDENT
        - Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment STUDENT Chris does your answer mentioned equipment
        - We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all STUDENT
        - My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon
        - So STUDENT if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence
        - But let's look at our discussion question
        - You're right you did talk about the water
        - Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?
        - Need you to narrow down your answer more specific
        - Okay, STUDENT, which what, what, where did you circle or words
        - Did what important word or words did you circle in the question
        - And they do use that, but I'm just like with STUDENT
        - I asked him, did they use that to discover the water
        - How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters
        - When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us
        - Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future
        - But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon
        - Yeah, which that really isn't telling us
        - What the machine was right
        - STUDENT Did you find anything was talking about oxygen
        - Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?
        - And I think STUDENT That you had told us about oxygen tanks
        - Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else
        - Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon
        - STUDENT Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question
        - So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need STUDENT of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?
        - And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?
        - And she said, NASA send a small machine
        - Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer
        - What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?
        - Bus a small machine that could be anything
        - So what else could you put in your answer?
        - Do you know what the small machine was called?
        - It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade STUDENT
        - As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that
        - So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but
        - Improvement and tell me what changes
        - Did you make
        - Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine
        - Um, depending on size
        - How do you feel about your answer
        - I think a STUDENT
        - What might you say instead
        - Just to kind of circle back a little bit
        - Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the STUDENT there
        - If you were giving it another shot at it
        - Now, what was the microscope attached to?
        - You didn't actually name the machine, right
        - Does that answer the question
        - So if you look into your statement
        - So that's going to be very valuable
        - So what else can be valuable there
        - It talks about in there
        - How are you going to is that STUDENT of the information or just one part of it
        - What else, what other purposes
        - Does this takes point two for that answer
        - Right, so it can be used for what else
        - And they have, what do you know, there's one more
        - Very much and STUDENT
        - There's one more
        - But did the microscope actually find the water?
        - So okay, so are those reasons that it could be valuable
        - Did you hear that somewhere else
        - So did you read that in our paragraph, or did you listen
        - Is there any other words that are important
        - Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at our question again and see if that answers
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So it's good
        - But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable
        - It says it's good
        - I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information
        - Um, so do you
        - What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think
        - Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use
        - We want to learn more
        - Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon
        - But we're we're expanding our thinking
        - What could we do to improve that response
        - Improve that in response
        - Can STUDENT else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water
        - Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?
        - But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope
        - Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?
        - But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?
        - But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?
        - Or is there a better answer?
        - There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?
        - However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?
        - Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?
        - But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?
        - They use a lot of equipment
        - While that's true, is that what they used?
        - And just like STUDENT, he had mentioned some as well
        - So does that say that that's what NASA sent though STUDENT?
        - STUDENT, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - But does that say, that's what they sent
        - So they used, how can we
        - How could we restate this question
        - How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a
        - What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about
        - How could we restate that question
        - Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or
        - Let's see, let me think about that
        - Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while
        - How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while
        - Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about
        - Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important
        - Now try to think about that next time
        - Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space
        - Does that tell us
        - But it just says that they found evidence that there was water
        - Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there
        - Does that mean that there's a lot?
        - Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?
        - But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon
        - So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water
        - They use it to examine the water
        - So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it
        - Okay, water could be one
        - Do you see any other words that could be important
        - But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource
        - So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and STUDENT
        - I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not
        - So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything
        - No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon
        - Moving forward, this could be very valuable
        - So what does the oxygen tank do STUDENT
        - astronauts could do what with the water
        - But if there was water on the moon, but that help us
        - But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon
        - And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall
        - Do you need water to live on Earth
        - But let's say for example the do you need
        - But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me
        - They might actually help out astronauts?
        - This can STUDENT does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon
        - Is there enough evidence
        - But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future
        - You know, you know, at least going forward
        - If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there
        - Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific
        - Okay, so when we answer something
        - That way there's no confusion
        - So you, how do you think if we took your answer
        - They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about
        - So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?
        - That we need to expand upon some of the answers
        - And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope
        - What did it show us
        - So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water
        - And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you
        - I'm gonna say STUDENT
        - It's, you just need to support it
        - So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon STUDENT?
        - So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment
        - Let's look at back at some of our answers
        - So I see that we have
        - Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage
        - So, STUDENT that you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment
        - Did you find
        - In why microscope wasn't the best choice
        - because the microscope was a tool
        - In fact, so
        - So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool
        - But how did they discover it or another word
        - How did they find that water
        - So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - Right? So the microscope does help us see the water
        - But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place
        - So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right
        - My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split
        - What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you
        - But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon
        - Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today
        - Oh, STUDENT, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down
        - It says that the whole time throughout the article
        - Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water
        - So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - That is very true
        - Did people go up on the moon, though
        - Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read
        - Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article
        - Is there a title of that machine
        - Is there a name of that machine in number two?
        - Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response
        - The rest of the article?
        - Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope
        - Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon
        - Do you remember?
        - They used a microscope
        - But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space
        - So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you
        - I would like for one person in each group to share their answers with the group so Farrah and Deb, you want to view, give me what words you STUDENT underlying the question
        - STUDENT, you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct
        - So, do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer
        - STUDENT What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer
        - Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question
        - I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct
        - Can one of you tell me what words you STUDENT underline
        - That may not in depth
        - How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer
        - How could you be more specific in your answer
        - Teacherr: So how could you look back
        - To find that answer
        - Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer
        - So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything
        - So if the water is microscopic STUDENT, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment
        - Yeah, so I guess STUDENT also soften your answer
        - So STUDENT after, after reading, paragraph three, do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes?
        - Does STUDENT want to share what they circled
        - Did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling The key word in the question?
        - Farrah, did you Farrah and STUDENT
        - Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes
        - Do you think that your answer answers the question, STUDENT
        - So STUDENT, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope
        - Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it
        - But is that STUDENT we use to get there and be able to observe said water?
        - I don't think it quite is
        - But is that STUDENT that they used in order to find the water
        - So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon
        - Is that completely accurate
        - How do you STUDENT think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed
        - I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your STUDENT members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions
        - Remember, he uses a microscope
        - Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope
        - Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits
        - Right, so the microscope
        - However, scientists were not on the moon
        - If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope
        - So your initial answer kind of got started on that process
        - You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen
        - That's a great answer
        - But why can't take a spring water with them
        - Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them
        - What do you say,
        - You did kind of explain that you said that they need water
        - But it's even more valuable because they
        - And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes STUDENT
        - When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water
        - What can the astronaut use
        - Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have
        - What are we trying to make by STUDENT tanks and Luis's two elements
        - So is it going to have a moon garden
        - So, hmm, is this patient, very large
        - Maybe, but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there
        - So do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon
        - I would tell you
        - Yeah, I like that
        - Do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said?
        - STUDENT, do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there
        - But is that the only thing that they sent, the only thing that they used
        - They will if, as if an astronaut went to the moon, they definitely would have to, but when we look at this, this text, do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon, or was it machines
        - I just would like the answer what the machine is called
        - Do you think that they would use both parts one part, what do you think?
        - that's definitely an aspect of it
        - um So do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts
        - Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?
        - Teacher:, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope
        - is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes
        - awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable
        - So even though it's not ready yet STUDENT, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future
        - It's just the oxygen tank
        - Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great
        - Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?
        - I'm glad that you could acknowledge that
        - It would help you to get to the moon right?
        - there's the possibility there's what STUDENT said what he said, is there any others, that you have found
        - so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water
        - right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right
        - Were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water
        - i'm so STUDENT, you said, water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship, other than its weight
        - On what your answers could be changed, how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what I was expecting from you STUDENT who'd like to go first
        - Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had
        - So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes STUDENT
        - Okay awesome alright Oliver so your answer was just circling the same as STUDENT is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer
        - But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer
        - Now, STUDENT, did you see where it said the equipment
        - And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what STUDENT said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?
        - Has STUDENT had a chance to reread the question in the passage?
        - Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked- you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable
        - So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me
        - Does STUDENT want to share what words they circled?
        - STUDENT, what did you circle?
        - Okay STUDENT else? any other words?
        - What did you circle?
        - You only circled water
        - What about you STUDENT you're one who hasn't shared yet
        - So what is the answer to our question?
        - yeah What was it called
        - So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail
        - So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope
        - They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy
        - that's true, but how does that relate to water
        - Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable
        - So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you STUDENT think that it's valuable that there could be water there
        - Have you found anything
        - But let's think about what else they used
        - And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used
        - So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it
        - I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it
        - Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank
        - A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember
        - that's perfect, do you know any other tools
        - can you add another tool to that
        - The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?
        - Have you thought of an answer
        - STUDENT Do you have anything
        - After giving yourself a little bit more time
        - Did you figure out any answers
        - so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at STUDENT?
        - It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing
        - Ok, so if you had to redo your answer STUDENT What would you say now?
        - mm hmm and then what would you add to it?
        - Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?
        - but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is
        - So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response
        - can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?
        - yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?
        - So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon
        - All right, you guys did an awesome job STUDENT after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers
        - Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage
        - That's a great question
        - So who thinks
        - Do you think the passage list STUDENT the equipment they used or just a few of the common
        - SO I'M STUDENT in your response
        - You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does
        - STUDENT, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response
        - Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit
        - So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer
        - So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks
        - Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at
        - Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine
        - now they have room for what STUDENT?
        - Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing STUDENT
        - But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water
        - What is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like, what can you expand on your answer
        - A little bit
        - Um, can I ask, how about STUDENT, do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit
        - So I do agree with you, but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker, do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon, instead of bringing it on their ship or now well, I mean if they could do it faster and quicker than
        - yeah, but do you agree that if it was ready, that it would be awesome to have it on the moon
        - So Farrah would you want to maybe like how about Farrah and STUDENT could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer
        - With the information that we just talked about STUDENT together
        - Right, so let's go back to your response real fast
        - You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?
        - That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon
        - On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay
        - yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water
        - Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than Farrah's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story
        - so was there a word that you guys picked in your STUDENT that you got that you thought was important to a question
        - So what words are what equipment has mentioned
        - That is also used to find water on the moon
        - Would STUDENT like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled
        - The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?
        - STUDENT, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer
        - Where do we use a lunar orbiter?
        - On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?
        - How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?
        - but also because the water is so small on the moon right?
        - So how can we add those into our answer?
        - STUDENT, how can you change your answer?
        - All right, let's go to STUDENT Jazmin, how can you change your answer?
        - yeah all right STUDENT, how can you include those into your answer?
        - So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?
        - So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon
        - awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit STUDENT to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?
        - STUDENT, how can you change your answer?
        - Well, your answer is not completely wrong
        - You did say that NASA send a small machine, but can you tell me what that small machine is
        - So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, STUDENT?
        - But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?
        - You are probably right, NASA does have a lot of money
        - So what would you add STUDENT to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment
        - That they use to find that water
        - Do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water?
        - So do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors
        - Do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot
        - So thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and STUDENT the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it
        - Do you think that NASA used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon
        - That's really, really cool
        - Does any of that equipment that you listed
        - Do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon
        - Because a small machine could be anything
        - It could be
        - It could be a computer later right
        - Because if I was somebody that didn't read the text I could think of small machine was anything right?
        - That would make your answer spectacular
        - Yes, but I'm going to challenge you for a minute
        - Can I challenge you, as a detective
        - Totally know it's, it is important, but I would like you to look for the other one too, okay?
        - Is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water
        - So can you tell us what to the oxygen tanks used for
        - So what do you think, how will you revise your answer to include the equipment
        - And because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer
        - Okay, so what was one of the keywords that are you circled, STUDENT?
        - And STUDENT else do want to show you your keywords
        - And I appreciate that you used the evidence from the text, but do think microscope is the best answer?
        - When you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer
        - How you will make your answer more specific?
        - Teacher : Yes, it's very, very cool
        - But is that equipment
        - Were craters equipment?
        - Teacher : Right, so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it
        - Teacher : Right, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but that doesn't necessarily say that NASA sent a microscope to look really closely, it does it
        - But what was the key word that help the scientists find the water on the moon?
        - Do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool, or do you think the microscope is after doing more research?
        - And so, STUDENT after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one
        - Right, so the microscope helps us see things that is really small, but Not necessarily found the water on the earth right?
        - The Lunar Orbiter, or do you think the microscope did?
        - Do you think found the water
        - Right so STUDENT, which tool
        - The small pieces of ice
        - So did the Lunar Orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water?
        - So do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together
        - So is that referring to any equipment, that the scientists found or used?
        - Yeah, discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first, what are they asking?
        - Discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part
        - Do you think we would be able to see STUDENT of the water on the moon
        - If we had a microscope in our classroom
        - Or do you need more than that
        - Right, they did and they did that through what equipment
        - Did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        - So do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is
        - But what is our question asking us
        - Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water
        - And that's one part of it
        - Do you remember any other parts from the reading
        - Do you remember what it was called
        - And in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer
        - Is there anything that you think you might want to add to that
        - And as you're reading
        - And as you're reading
        - What are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add?
        - I can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them
        - But I really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step, maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut
        - So we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that
        - Do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water
        - So STUDENT You answered equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Yeah, and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water, but do you think it helped us to discover that water
        - and so do you think that if we look back in our texts, there's something that says  A piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope
        - Do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer
        - Do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned
        - Yeah, so that's a great answer
        - But I'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that
        - Do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer
        - Looking at that question now and looking at what you just read
        - We read in the text
        - So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers
        - I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it
        - Do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon
        - So did your original answer change in any way after working with STUDENT
        - Has STUDENT is thinking changed
        - STUDENT Would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers
        - So you said a small machine, but what some machine would you be talking about
        - So now STUDENT going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use, but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon
        - In a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope
        - Yes, so I see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon, but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit
        - The sentence and your previous answer
        - what's The purpose of this equipment
        - Okay, so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question
        - Just the machines name right
        - But the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks
        - Do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water?
        - I wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope, you need to have a sample
        - You can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope
        - Do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert
        - Do you think there's water on the moon, a lot of water
        - And we read past that first sentence
        - If we look at I'm at point two
        - Can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water
        - Okay, did you have any different thoughts
        - So, does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer
        - Do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question
        - Do you have a question
        - STUDENT, have you chosen a vocab word yet
        - I want you to have a revised answer
        - And when you come out of that
        - So maybe your answer is already right but maybe I want a little more, maybe your answer is not really right
        - And you can just change it completely
        - So go back into the text
        - So maybe, maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt
        - Alright, I see people looking up
        - So I think we're gonna I'm gonna ask for some provide answers
        - Anyone else have any information that they can share with me, STUDENT
        - Did you circle then
        - So what it, what word
        - What did you circle STUDENT
        - Farrah, and STUDENT were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment
        - Okay, so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon
        - You know what else did they use
        - You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon
        - Do you think that your answer answers that question
        - Um, did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water?
        - some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that
        - What might be the effect that where we just read a text one time
        - so can STUDENT explain to me how the water that was found on the moon, is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth
        - so STUDENT we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that
        - Do they go to the moon? The astronauts? Or is it the machine was sent to moon? What do you think STUDENT?
        - When we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water, though, do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks
        - yeah so um I love that you STUDENT were thinking about them that equipment, because that is an important tool but  were they using it, the microscope to find it or to look at it
        - Okay, and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's STUDENT from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so
        - or revise I should say yeah STUDENT
        - Does STUDENT else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers
        - yeah awesome Okay, so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part?
        - So looking back at the text, are there any other details that you might want to include now
        - So STUDENT, you also wrote your response about the microscope
        - Okay, so if you got to -when you revise your response, what do you think you'll change?
        - So if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon, like STUDENT the rest of our friends here said, think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon
        - I want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists, be able to use the microscopes on the moon?
        - So an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like STUDENT said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe, do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay
        - So, yes you're 100% correct So if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover STUDENT of the water on the moon, or just bits and pieces of that water
        - Okay, and that's correct, do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon
        - Correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water
        - Would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope
        - So were there other things, that the astronauts used to look for water, other than the microscope?
        - So if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away, just like the water on the moon that far away
        - Yes, I think they're really cool
        - But they did need the microscope to look closely at it, but for that first discovery, what did they need?
        - So STUDENT excellent analysis
        - Do you now see what the name of that tool was called?
        - do you see the name of that tool there in the text
        - Do we find the name of the tool that found the water on the moon
        - one thing we want to pinpoint, though, is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about
        - was the Lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water
        - So do you think you could add something to your answer STUDENT to make it more complete in more correct
        - STUDENT, you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment, but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or
        - Oh, so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water
        - can you tell me a little bit more, what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same?
        - But in this case are we looking for information from your brain, or are we looking for information from the article?
        - So what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer
        - So what do you know about a microscope
        - Very good, so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this, to try and find STUDENT of that water
        - Do you remember the name of the small machine
        - Now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is, do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water?
        - So STUDENT, do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea, do you think we're ready to do that, you know, in a year you think we're set up for that well
        - do we remember what the small machine was called
        - so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer
        - Okay So did we we read about those things in the paragraphs, though? Did they talk about that in the paragraph?
        - Those are STUDENT great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right?
        - So oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe
        - But what exactly helped the scientists find the water?
        - If we have oxygen but not this small machine, the Lunar orbiter, can we find the ice?
        - Perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer NASA send a small machine, if you are going to level that up like a video game, if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer, how might you get a little bit more clarity there
        - does that machine have a name
        - what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it
        - hmm because thinking about Jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists
        - What are your thoughts about how the scientists actually found
        - yeah I think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer, what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well
        - Right, what, why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though
        - then STUDENT, what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water
        - To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water STUDENT do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon
        - So here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that, based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do, you still think that there is a crater full of water, what do you think
        - Absolutely STUDENT I guess, I want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space
        - Or is a more of once the water is found, then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount, what would you say
        - but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text
        - So do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger?
        - Does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon
        - Yes, you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right
        - yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit NASA or are we looking somewhere else for our answer
        - So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water?
        - so what lets the scientists, know that the water is there
        - After you thought, and you have a good solid thought let's share, what does that mean
        - So a microscope is a piece of equipment that does something, but does it discover so think about that piece of feedback and see how it applies to your work
        - Right and is that what we're looking for is a
        - Beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment
        - What I want you to look for right, so you pulled out the word of discover does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else, is it just one equipment to find it are we using it to discover it think about that
        - Exactly so in your response, did you name an equipment that discovers water
        - And the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from STUDENT your knowledge you already have
        - Okay, and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it
        - yeah yeah I agree that scientists did find some evidence that there was water on the moon, but do you think that the crater the craters are full of water?
        - But did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon
        - and so i'm savannas answer was scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon do we think that answer the questions completely? STUDENT
        - Are there any other words you would use to describe this marker?
        - Do we know what kind of small machine because, like my my mouse right here is also a small machine, but I don't think that they sent this kind of small machine
        - What kind of small machine did they send?
        - that's true yeah, and so I wonder if
        - Do you think that they're using those when they're using the small machine?
        - When they're- Do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits?
        - Oh right right, so I wonder Chris if they're if they're wearing STUDENT those things and they're using their lunar orbiter, then what how did they use the Lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon?
        - I wonder if we're missing some pieces, I think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon STUDENT like what about soil
        - so i'm curious if any of you STUDENT could look over paragraph two, to see if perhaps um any of you want to add to your response uh
        - and I really want you STUDENT to just circle um in your responses, the equipment that you that you answered in the the question with, okay,
        - And I also want you to think about um if, after looking at the text, if you want to modify your response at STUDENT
        - does STUDENT feel like they want to modify their or change their answer
        - Are you are you asking, are you telling
        - Which one, do you think is correct microscopes or lunar orbiters
        - um so let's try to combine some answers So what did they what did they use to get to the moon, in the first place
        - Which piece of equipment, did they use if it's not a microscope
        - So if there is a base on the moon,  if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes ,which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon
        - so how can we add that into Jazmin's response
        - Where did they send it to did you include that STUDENT
        - Right, so I think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response
        - Do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there
        - So do you see STUDENT how a Microscope, microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space
        - yeah yeah so so what what does everyone else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the Lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah STUDENT
        - STUDENT so, can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space, but what do you think they use to discover water
        - Are those pieces of equipment that you saw NASA used to discover water on the moon, or they used for a different purpose
        - So I want you to think about that a little bit okay and see if you can use the answer to that question revise your answer, thank you STUDENT alright if
        - so STUDENT, how do you feel about your response at this point
        - i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that STUDENT right, and then we're going to go around and talk about it
        - so this finding Equator are saying that they found the Quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question
        - Okay, what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem, it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use
        - so with That being said, they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely, but then does that help us yep does
        - Okay, so for that, how would they get the microscope to the moon
        - In the reading I didn't see anything that said anything about oxygen tanks
        - So what is the small machine called
        - Do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon
        - So STUDENT I know your answer was that they sent small machines, but you know what those machines are called Do you remember
        - Exactly, and do you remember what they do, what do they look for
        - um Do you remember where they were
        - yeah Do you remember what a microscope is used for
        - yeah they do so STUDENT Chris, I know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon Do you remember how they found them
        - yeah Do you remember what they used to find them
        - STUDENT you have a different one?
        - Good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use
        - But they do, they do, what exactly
        - Why would it be helpful, though, to have it on the moon, rather than to bring it with them on a space shuttle right STUDENT was just telling us that it's very heavy
- intent: r120.4
  examples: |
        - So let's see STUDENT what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share Their answer and what they were thinking
        - yeah so STUDENT What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me
        - hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from Farrah all the way down to STUDENT from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question

        - Chris, did you discuss your observation with Jazmin do you STUDENT have an answer?
        - so I think that's can take us back to what's Farrah and STUDENT have been looking at
        - Farrah and STUDENT, have found the answer to this entire question by now? would you like to share your answer?
        - would like to go and answer them okay so
        - Okay, I think I see it, would you like to share what you see
        - so, why now, why do you think that we are not ready for this exploration for a long time
        - STUDENT, why do you go ahead
        - Was I was just asking
        - What did you like the most, STUDENT?
        - STUDENT, what do you think?
        - STUDENT I know you do right?
        - STUDENT, what do you think?
        - STUDENT, what do you think
        - Okay somebody else tell me what word they thought was really important in that question to kind of give us a clue to what the answer should be
        - And how about you STUDENT? What word do you think is real important in that question, to give us that clue to find the right answer?
        - What do you think, STUDENT?
        - So STUDENT, what do you think
        - go ahead STUDENT, what were you going to say?
        - Can you remind me which part you and STUDENT circled again?
        - So Oliver, you told me you circled the same answer as STUDENT
        - And STUDENT, what did you just tell me about the -what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon?
        - Okay, my stopwatch is actually broken, but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then STUDENT, what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf, and how they actually maybe got that water
        - so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question
        - Okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it
        - And water on the moon okay i'm go back, could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question, what was the what how did you first answer it
        - Oh yeah STUDENT What was your answer again
        - Excellent STUDENT why don't you start us off, how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit
        - Okay Oliver and STUDENT sorry, you know both both kind of speaking same time Oliver let's doyou first and then Farrah
        - Right exactly can STUDENT else tell us anything they read in the article
        - i'm moving on her from STUDENT What did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet
        - Okay What was your answer
        - or anyone else can jump in if you'd like, are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water? yes, STUDENT
        - STUDENT um So what did you learn about those craters on the moon
        - and can you go ahead and remind me, what did you respond
        - STUDENT What did you share what did you find as your response to that question
        - STUDENT, would you be able to share with us, which you were able to locate
        - STUDENT can you share what you how you respond to that question
        - and so STUDENT go ahead and share it you're about to share
        - Hey STUDENT, how's your search going
        - All right, great job so based on the question that STUDENT just read out to us what should our answer be
        - So I know that we spent some time looking at the questions right looking at the sentences and the text Can somebody give me a sentence that stuck out to them that they think answers this question
        - and I want us to move on to the second question, and before we do that can Somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question
        - Did anybody get it does anybody know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this, STUDENT
        - Okay, great so would you like to share with the with the STUDENT what you found what text you found to answer that question, that would be super helpful
        - i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right
        - yeah STUDENT let's start with you, thank you for volunteering
        - yeah STUDENT why don't you go ahead and share your answer
        - yeah STUDENT go ahead and share with us
        - Oliver I haven't heard from you, yet do you think we've found STUDENT of the equipment that they used in this text
        - Okay, who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt
        - Yes, well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt, though
        - Okay, so who can tell me, one of the words that they thought of that means the same thing as equipment STUDENT have a word that they wrote down
        - Okay, savana what what where did you write down
        - STUDENT else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment
        - Why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover STUDENT why don't we hear from you first
        - one more word that someone wrote down for discover STUDENT have another idea here
        - Really, what did what was your response to this question, can you just remind me
        - let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts
        - How about you STUDENT
        - STUDENT right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you
        - STUDENT What did you say
        - Alright, so let's move on um let's see uh STUDENT can you read what your answer was please
        - let's move on, so um STUDENT, could you please read your response out loud
        - So could STUDENT tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this?
        - and STUDENT, could you please tell us?
        - Great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled
        - okay so on STUDENT, could you please read for me your answer
        - All right, would STUDENT like to share What were they circled
        - that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer
        - Alright, would anyone like to share what they wrote for those questions STUDENT go ahead
        - So we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So STUDENT can you remind me what your answer was? what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Oh OK, and then STUDENT can you tell me what you said, as your as your answer?
        - Oh, could you STUDENT could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in Part two
        - STUDENT What did you circle
        - yeah go ahead STUDENT
        - it says STUDENT, can you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in number three
        - Yes, would STUDENT like to volunteer to go first
        - Would STUDENT else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready
        - anyone else have responses yeah STUDENT
        - would STUDENT like to volunteer to go first and start us off by reading your answer
        - Who would like to go next
        - What STUDENT else, like to share
        - hmm yeah could you read your answer for me
        - But i'm excited to hear how you connect STUDENT that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water, do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article, we read
        - Would anyone else, like to share well STUDENT goes back to read the article
        - While Chris goes back to read what STUDENT else, like to share their responses
        - hmm could you read your answer for me

        - Okay, why don't you share with us
        - and STUDENT or Farrah do either one of you want to share sure Chris
        - what are you working on in this response
        - yeah let's see do you want to add something
        - Do you want to share your revised answer
        - So finally miss STUDENT
        - So what's your revised answered
        - Do you remember your first answer
        - that's tell me tell me okay

        - Well Would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like?
        - Thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact I didn't know that does STUDENT else, want to try working through their response or strengthening it
        - Great now let's give STUDENT the opportunity to answer my question
        - Excellent thanks Farrah and STUDENT Would you mind sharing, can you share what you circled
        - Now STUDENT, can you tell us what you you wrote as your response
        - STUDENT can raise their hand or shout out
        - Oh well, then, would you like to start, do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So do you want to share answer with the STUDENT and we can work through it together
        - um So do you want to go first, so how did you answer this question
        - yeah all right okay perfect so um let's let's go around does someone want to tell me what words or phrases they circled when looking at this question yeah STUDENT
        - Can someone else tell me what other words they circled or phrases that they circled in this question
        - Do you want to share it with the STUDENT yeah okay
        - yeah I agree, I do think that they use the microscope to look closely at the water but STUDENT do you want to share your answer
        - Oh yeah do you want to share with the STUDENT
        - So do you want to offer your answer what was your different answer
        - So using these STUDENT of this information, what are we thinking
        - What did STUDENT else write
        - you said they found a Small machine and now you think what was the second half of your sentence?
        - Okay cool, I think we are all really excited to hear what you have to say so i'm going to go ahead and start with STUDENT I know you have your paper in front of you Farrah Would you mind reading aloud what answer you gave to that question, we had
        - Oh wow okay perfect so you guys are all familiar with that scientific tool, thank you for your answer Farrah let's see who would like to read the response next do we have any volunteers yeah perfect go ahead STUDENT
        - alright, so we have had Farrah and Jazmin share their answers, so far, and we have Luis STUDENT and they've left with either one of you like to volunteer to go next
        - Okay perfect sounds good let's see we have STUDENT and Luis left would either of you like to go okay go for it Chris
        - But thank you so much for your answer Chris, and I think it is now time to move on to STUDENT are you ready to share your answer Luis
        - All right, perfect so STUDENT, can you go ahead and read your response to me
        - let's hear what you STUDENT have been talking about
        - All right, i'll be right here all right Oliver and Farrah, how is it going what have you STUDENT been discussing
        - Thank you Jazmin alright STUDENT, can you go ahead and read your response to me Chris
        - What do you think STUDENT do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts
        - and so you all had answers that i'd like to draw on, and I think I want to start with STUDENT Jazmin, can you tell us what you said for this first question
        - yeah and then I also noticed that Oliver and STUDENT you guys took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because I, I think you guys used a different word, maybe Farrah do you mind telling us what you mentioned, for your answer
        - STUDENT you said the same thing?
        - STUDENT I want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon, do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon
        - STUDENT, you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon, do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon
        - yeah STUDENT do you have something to add
        - Well, first of STUDENT, can you tell us what you said, what can we do with that water
        - STUDENT, what do you think
        - Do you want to start
        - yeah yes STUDENT, you want to add to that
        - what about you STUDENT
        - awesome we're gonna come back together STUDENT What did you learn from Jazmin's response
        - awesome okay STUDENT, what did you talk about
        - Thank you STUDENT What was your answer again
        - So, you said that you circle, the same answer so vana what answer was that
        - STUDENT What was your answer
        - STUDENT, can you tell me what your answer was again
        - What was your answer again
        - Okay, do you want to go first
        - And then STUDENT Do you remember what you said
        - Okay, so how about somebody else in your group tell me what you got to the final answer either Chris and STUDENT
        - Okay cool and STUDENT go ahead
        - Great STUDENT right now let's get some more quiet hands, what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question
        - Is there STUDENT who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two
        - Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their STUDENT when they've improved
        - Does someone to have a response, they might want to share with the STUDENT
        - So i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were
        - STUDENT, can you tell me what your response was
        - STUDENT you've been waiting so patiently, can you go first, what do you need
- intent: r220.1
  examples: |
        - Hello um I think these are STUDENT really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so Can I get a yes
        - I think we STUDENT have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text
        - Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to OK, so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us To understand a little bit what we're reading, but we specifically also want to look for evidence right
        - The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this STUDENT is I want you to think what is this question asking
        - what what does it mean to circle evidence
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - So what is an ice deposit
        - And we had some really great responses
        - So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text
        - But in a text
        - It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, STUDENT of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - Well, we're gonna learn some more
        - I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about
        - Thank you for joining me at the small group table, STUDENT
        - Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon
        - And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have
        - I just want you STUDENT to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage
        - But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we STUDENT struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question
        - Hey STUDENT, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer
        - STUDENT What's going on
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        - I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me
        - Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer
        - But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer
        - Oh yes, STUDENT
        - And I wanted to kind of dive into these here
        - I want to make sure we're STUDENT on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent
        - And I'm really excited to get to talk to you STUDENT about it
        - So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article
        - Now we got to read about something really cool
        - To get more specific with our response
        - Not just one person answering okay
        - Um, well, we are going to work together as a team to answer this question, this is a team effort
        - We are just diving deeper into the text as a team, so that STUDENT is on the same page
        - Who knows, have a strategy that we can use
        - So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question
        - That's what we're going to do
        - So let's take a look at your answers
        - And so in this case
        - Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space
        - And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that
        - So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more
        - Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion
        - So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we STUDENT thought the answers were
        - And the, the question
        - Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough
        - Okay? Do you know what thorough is?
        - We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions
        - So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses
        - Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our
        - Writing that is going to help us connect and learn
        - We want to see the process of how are we going to
        - Can we do that
        - Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response
        - So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about
        - STUDENT right, great
        - Okay, so what was our question
        - Can someone read that for me
        - So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text
        - So here's what we're gonna do, STUDENT
        - We're going to go through each of your responses
        - Okay, so let's look at your response
        - Okay, so let's look back at STUDENT answer real quick
        - First, what did you say
        - Does that sound good to you STUDENT
        - So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you STUDENT about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage
        - we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon
        - So remember the discussion question is-- yes STUDENT?
        - STUDENT right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer
        - Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know STUDENT about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about
        - I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it
        - So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff
        - I didn't even know about water on the moon
        - So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this STUDENT
        - So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers
        - But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions
        - So I want you STUDENT to look at question number two
        - Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this STUDENT so that we can focus on
        - So I suppose I will start with
        - So that's the main goal of what we're working on together
        - extracting information from from informative text
        - Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the STUDENT can learn from
        - So work on STUDENT learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those
        - A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small STUDENT is to kind of build off those responses
        - So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better
        - Does that make sense?
        - So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you STUDENT previous you read called water on the moon
        - And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you just raise your hand
        - I'll call on you
        - So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you
        - And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work
        - So what we can do is just kind of go around the room
        - But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting
        - So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good
        - But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question
        - Well, I hope you're right
        - Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a STUDENT to kind of share our knowledge with each other
        - Because we're not just
        - So does STUDENT want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer
        - I saw bits and pieces of that in there
        - Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers
        - It's good to see you too
        - So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you STUDENT answer
        - You're talking about space
        - Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon
        - So the reason why we're looking back over your answers
        - but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that STUDENT
        - Write down for your answers
        - You STUDENT put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is
        - Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so
        - And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence
        - Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer
        - I do like that you what you changed your answer to
        - And we're going to hang out
        - We're going to help other people in this STUDENT use that same thought process
        - And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer
        - Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer
        - We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give
        - Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords
        - Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this STUDENT
        - So today I want us to work on finding
        - keywords in questions to help us better answer questions
        - So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer
        - We're all going to be in the STUDENT to learn together and discuss what we read
        - We're just having a STUDENT discussion now that we've read
        - Okay well we're all put in this STUDENT to help each other learn, um,
        - And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out
        - Sound like a plan?
        - So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together
        - But we're not STUDENT quite there just yet
        - I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell STUDENT of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time
        - One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to STUDENT of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes
        - That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my STUDENT
        - And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your STUDENT discussion
        - Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one STUDENT
        - And I want to make sure that STUDENT has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water
        - Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon
        - You might find something that you didn't know
        - Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today
        - The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you STUDENT
        - No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you STUDENT got your answers from
        - Well we're STUDENT gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it
        - For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text
        - Does that sound good
        - So for this STUDENT, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading
        - tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you STUDENT to use examples exactly from the text that way
        - I know that you STUDENT had an easy time reading
        - Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do
        - It sounds good to you, STUDENT?
        - good to hear so today I put you on a STUDENT because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon
        - and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon
        - There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you STUDENT will be time to write down your answers to questions
        - Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small STUDENT, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer
        - So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes STUDENT
        - So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you
        - So, STUDENT to start
        - So I think you guys STUDENT did a really great job thinking while using our text
        - I know that you know STUDENT about space
        - It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts
        - But this isn't about learning about space
        - Does that makes sense?
        - So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text
        - So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them
        - You may know STUDENT about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages
        - So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you STUDENT can better understand
        - How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage
        - So I want one-- yes, STUDENT
        - So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did STUDENT read? Yes, OK
        - So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding
        - So we're going to try to fix that today
        - hi STUDENT so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So first before we share our answers with the STUDENT, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question
        - STUDENT had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects
        - Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better
        - Maybe you STUDENT do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text
        - So I think so
        - In from the reading
        - However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material
        - So this really helpful
        - I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills
        - That can be true, however, today we're using science
        - to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about
        - As you STUDENT have done we're going to be using that reading
        - and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions
        - And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills
        - So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science
        - But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills
        - And how we work to break down questions and such um
        - I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language
        - Like I said to STUDENT earlier, we're not just working on our science skills, we're also working on our reading and writing skills
        - that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills
        - Um yeah, but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like STUDENT knows a lot about
        - we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down
        - information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff
        - So we just want to make sure that everybody is using the right language and everybody understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um STUDENT you had your hand up well, I was
        - So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question
        - But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question
        - Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies
        - Well, right now we're working on Olivereloping our responses
        - So even if you know a lot
        - It's about verbalizing what you know
        - So that's what we're practicing right now
        - What's up, STUDENT
        - Okay, so I just heard STUDENT of your awesome responses
        - So I'm going to start
        - And I just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text
        - Does that make sense
        - STUDENT But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon
        - Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space
        - So Luis I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you STUDENT to know is that
        - You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made STUDENT together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there
        - The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it
        - Because you're in this STUDENT doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done
        - So we're going to be focusing on just this text, so that we can digest this and answer the question
        - So even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information, but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read
        - So i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over, and so what I want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes STUDENT
        - So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you STUDENT an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for
        - Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does STUDENT remember
        - Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer
        - So let's talk a little bit more about what we can - go ahead, STUDENT
        - That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more
        - So we are going to talk about The tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we're STUDENT here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question,
        - And the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts
        - I know that you know about space
        - So STUDENT, we're working on reading informational texts
        - That would be really cool
        - And look for those answers in the text
        - Okay STUDENT Do question
        - Hey, so today we're going to do something super cool
        - Okay, so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text
        - We are going to be reading detectives
        - I have learned that about you and it's something I value about you, but I want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks
        - You know what you think
        - This year, you're going to need that skills
        - Because when we read informational texts
        - We asked that to answer and test a dependent question
        - If you still have some progress
        - Hello, boys and girls
        - And what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy, then you are going to practice it in a small STUDENT and I will come back to talk a little more individually
        - We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that STUDENT knows that you have a full understanding of the topic
        - I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us
        - I know I remember that
        - And based on your answer
        - We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given
        - However, we're working on a few different things in this STUDENT
        - Because what's cool about partial answers
        - Well, Luis This STUDENT is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other
        - And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers
        - Is that STUDENT has different partial answers
        - Okay, so let's STUDENT read read through it
        - I think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers
        - I also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there
        - but we're going to go over this question together because I think that STUDENT of us
        - Had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question
        - And I want to lead us to the right answer today
        - So I'm just here to clarify the answer for us
        - Either we STUDENT didn't write it for our answer
        - And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer
        - But you didn't write that for your answer
        - Okay, I got us into this STUDENT because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers
        - So I've seend all responses, and I would like for you STUDENT to use evidence from the text to support your answer
        - Does STUDENT know what I mean by using evidence from the text
        - hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you STUDENT today i'm excited to work with you on trying to Oliverelop really complete answers
        - I just pulled you STUDENT together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said
        - Yeah, so that's why I wanted to pull you into this STUDENT so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question, fully
        - so then we can go forward and make sure that we're STUDENT on the same page about what, what did they use
        - I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather STUDENT this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer
        - I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for
        - Yeah, yeah, some great stuff
        - How do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need
        - So we're, we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading
        - So sometimes when I'm reading, there's so much information
        - Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text
        - We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information
        - what we're doing today, why have you guys in a STUDENT is because we're trying to go even further we're going to
        - Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you STUDENT
        - are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you
        - What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates
        - I want STUDENT of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text
        - Or we can strengthen your responses
        - But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you
        - wasting your own time, because we really want to think about moving forward in the future, how to answer questions to the best of our ability
        - Yes, that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and everybody else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three, just so we can STUDENT look and think critically about this piece of evidence, to see if it matches our question um
        - I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more
        - Get more detail in there
        - So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer STUDENT
        - Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text
        - Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further
        - But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today STUDENT
        - And will also give personalized feedback during this process, and finally, we will reflect on the strategies and thoughts that led us to the revised response
        - I am going to either pair you up with a partner or speak to you individually about your response and we'll kind of talk about why you wrote that response and maybe some ways that we could improve your response
        - Well, thanks for sharing your responses to the second question STUDENT I think again, we have a great opportunity to take a look at the text to share with each other how we're thinking about this question and how we found our responses, using the text
        - And the timing starts now
        - And who knows, maybe we could also teach you something as well right? Because really what we're what we're kind of focusing on here at during this time is about how to also understand what the questions are asking you STUDENT, right?
        - so let's say we are taking a test right and you write down everything you know about space
        - But what if it doesn't answer the questions they're asking right?
        - so we're STUDENT here we're going to focus more on making sure that we understand the question that's being asked of us, okay? so we're going to practice, these skills
        - Great so I want us to take in consideration the context of the question and we're STUDENT going to analyze our responses and think about how we can improve them or make them stronger or maintain the quality of our responses
        - each of you have an answer that hits one of those two parts, and so, for pretty much everyone in this STUDENT i'd like to offer some suggestions of how you might get both of those two parts in your answers
- intent: r230.2
  examples: |
        - Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes STUDENT
        - So STUDENT can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say
        - yeah so STUDENT can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that
        - But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her
        - Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different
        - Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made
        - STUDENT based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing
        - And what makes you think that way
        - STUDENT Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says
        - Where did you find evidence that
        - The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Can you tell me where what you found
        - Does that tell us that that happened
        - You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Let's talk about your answer
        - Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks
        - That's right, good job
        - Can you tell me what paragraph you found
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Did you find that answer in the in the text?
        - Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as STUDENT but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because
        - Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what STUDENT had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing
        - Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?
        - STUDENT, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question
        - If you will refer back to your article back to your reading
        - I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water STUDENT, I see your hand up
        - So, STUDENT, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water
        - Okay, Farrah does STUDENT answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three
        - Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?
        - So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find
        - Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in
        - So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though
        - So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely
        - Well, let's think about it this way, STUDENT, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?
        - Where did you read that in the text
        - So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used STUDENT, let's start with you
        - I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech
        - What evidence did you use
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle to help you answer
        - Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you
        - STUDENT What evidence
        - And I want to hear from STUDENT really quickly
        - What paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope
        - Okay, so you're, you want to talk, the microscope
        - And STUDENT, what happened
        - How did they study that the small ice deposits
        - Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is
        - Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?
        - Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope
        - So what do you STUDENT think about that
        - Where is the evidence that might help you with this question
        - Um, so does STUDENT remember what the name of that machine was called
        - Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?
        - And we also read in the paragraphs
        - What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools
        - And what else did you, did you read
        - So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?
        - Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water
        - Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?
        - So, I see deposits are very small
        - So it's using the equipment to do what?
        - So did they use the microscope to discover the water?
        - Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that
        - Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence
        - And what are we using to investigate our evidence?
        - So what are some things STUDENT of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five
        - Can we look back for some details? STUDENT
        - So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?
        - But does it mention that in the paragraphs?
        - So you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1
        - What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence
        - Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy
        - So read that sentence again for me
        - So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at
        - What is this, what was the small machine called
        - So what did this machine, do
        - And so you said they sent this machine
        - Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?
        - How much water did they find
        - Um you so talk to me about that
        - So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?
        - But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags
        - What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?
        - But what does it tell us in the story?
        - Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks
        - Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water
        - Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?
        - So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically
        - do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming
        - Did you circle in the text
        - Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence
        - You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence
        - Did you circle
        - Okay, well what paragraph
        - Do you think we can find that in
        - How did you find that answer
        - And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer
        - But what are we looking closely for?
        - Alright, so let's go look
        - Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there
        - What did it send the small machine to do?
        - So you talked about NASA sending a small machine
        - If we look back at the text
        - What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used
        - Teacher:But what equipment do you think they used to find it
        - Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?
        - And what does that lunar orbiter do?
        - To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?
        - And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things
        - and STUDENT, is that where you found your evidence as well?
        - And so that's very good, STUDENT
        - And where did you see that at?
        - Okay, they sent a small machine
        - What did it do?
        - That's one type of equipment
        - What else did they do with the equipment
        - Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article
        - Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine
        - Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included
        - I want you STUDENT to take a second to locate
        - In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you STUDENT to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope
        - Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well
        - Let's look at microscope
        - Did you find where we can find microscope and and there
        - Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?
        - Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?
        - No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence
        - What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen
        - How are they going to use the hydrogen?
        - Where did you get your answer from, STUDENT
        - Where did you find your answer?
        - So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage
        - What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage
        - STUDENT, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?
        - STUDENT You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks
        - What are they using that for
        - Did you look back in the text using your keywords
        - I'm so how did you find that answer
        - So I want STUDENT to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer
        - Where did you find in the text to support your answer
        - And STUDENT, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer
        - Why did you underline that in paragraph two
        - And so, STUDENT
        - STUDENT why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,
        - STUDENT Where did you come up with your answer
        - and STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story
        - In fact, STUDENT look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person
        - Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion
        - What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope
        - Now, do me a favor
        - Have you found it
        - To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage
        - Help me understand what led you to your conclusion
        - Do me a favor, go back into the text
        - Did you find the information about the crater
        - Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph
        - So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking
        - Help me, help me with yours
        - I asked you to find where you found your information in the text
        - Where'd you see it
        - And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine
        - Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text
        - Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?
        - They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for
        - Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss STUDENT, and you said that they sent a small machine
        - Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?
        - Could you share with the STUDENT The section that mentioned this tool
        - Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?
        - Okay um so what in the text makes you think that
        - Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?
        - Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to
        - Using a microscope as a piece of equipment
        - Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine
        - No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Is there a place in the text where you found that STUDENT
        - And you talked about that NASA send something
        - So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question STUDENT
        - The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,
        - so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text
        - Thank you alright STUDENT so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text
        - All right, awesome Thank you alright STUDENT, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat
        - All right, thank you so STUDENT where did you find your answer in the text
        - let's see where where did you find that in the text
        - yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us
        - Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay
        - and just a second the STUDENT can you find where the microscope is in text
        - awesome alright so STUDENT where did you find the information about microscope and the text
        - Really? I didn't know - is that, did you get that from the passage?
        - STUDENT you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?
        - OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter
        - Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you
        - So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that
        - Did you read that in the article
        - Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that
        - So could you like just show
        - Could you share with us where you found where you read um or just I can read your answer: scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - You said you had the same answer as STUDENT
        - Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading
        - um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?
        - Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use
        - How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?
        - And can we STUDENT think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that
        - You can go now
        - So can we go back right now, and we can STUDENT look at our responses, think about what we said
        - STUDENT, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?
        - And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?
        - Now, when STUDENT found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?
        - Good all right i'm going to call on STUDENT first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information
        - So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from
        - Can you show me where you found that
        - OK, and let's go to STUDENT
        - Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?
        - I like that, that is very true
        - STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?
        - Can you read me the sentence of one of them
        - Can you read me that sentence? Where you can find that?
        - And do you remember where we found that?
        - Is there a Quote, that you remember
        - I was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text
        - So you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes
        - You said NASA send a small machine
        - Do you read about that
        - Do you have text evidence from your response
        - Now where in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle, the same thing
        - Can you point that out, just so that everyone's on the same page
        - Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?
        - i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be Chris Jazmin STUDENT
        - But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource
        - Okay, and STUDENT you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text
        - Where did you find your evidence
        - um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up
        - STUDENT, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?
        - So where do you think you found that one
        - And do you know when we answer these I want you STUDENT to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text
        - Yeah they do use that that is a really good point
        - So like the microscope part, where was that?
        - You can say The number of the point it was on
        - Is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text
        - So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from?
        - Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text
        - So good so in the text where did you find that in the text, what made you choose as your response
        - Alright, so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question
        - STUDENT right, that is very true I want you to walk me through where you found that answer
        - In paragraph five, did you find it
        - So that you know where you saw that in the text?
        - But we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text
        - You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank
        - Why don't you look back now
        - So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know
        - And if you don't see it, that's okay too
        - And I see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five, is that correct
        - I do have a question for you
        - Is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article
        - Do you remember, or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on Earth
        - Right, what's, what's the textual evidence to support Chris's claim with the main idea of the first Paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon
        - And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore
        - Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is
        - Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable
        - Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts
        - If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel
        - Does I'm pretty cool
        - I just, I just need the actual text, please
        - Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you
        - Yes, good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so How does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use
        - But I just need you to write down where you found your answer
        - But then I want you to tell me where you find the evidence
        - Why, why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text
        - What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water STUDENT
        - I'm wondering how is your answer, different from STUDENT and what evidence did you use To explain how your you got a different answer from Jazmin and what evidence you used
        - Did you find evidence of that in the text
        - To look really closely
        - Teacher : So a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Teacher : STUDENT You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where did you see oxygen tanks
        - That's what came first, in the text right?
        - Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense
        - I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not STUDENT Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah
        - Where did you find your answer
        - And where did you find that
        - Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs
        - We are in the texts
        - The more specific
        - Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc
        - Wow, that's awesome Background information
        - Let me pull up my text, which paragraph was that in
        - And did you get that information from the reading that we did
        - And when you're reading through what makes you, where do you think that came from in the reading?
        - Where do you think STUDENT got the answer of the oxygen tanks
        - So as you're reading
        - Oh, where did you find that in the text
        - You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?
        - You found that in paragaph two as well right?
        - Let's look a little closer at Chris's answer
        - So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where Chris got his answer and what you might STUDENT yeah
        - Since we've looked at Jazmin's answer and Luis's answer
        - Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water
        - What did you read
        - If you notice the word so you can explain
        - And where did you get that idea from within the text
        - Yes exactly where you found it
        - Was that a big clue for you
        - Well what paragraph, did you get that from?
        - I like the way you're thinking, can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used
        - And STUDENT, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that
        - But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Yes, a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text
        - What are some things that are listed in the text
        - Did you see that in the text
        - Did you finding the passage
        - yeah which line it's
        - So, can you tell me like where you found this answer, STUDENT?
        - Oh, a lot, where do you find this information
        - Oh, where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph
        - Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?
        - So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water
        - Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono
        - So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word
        - What do you think that
        - Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text
        - So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks
        - I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking
        - So I'm also going to follow the same question for you
        - So I'm glad you said that
        - So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and STUDENT, what exactly what language or what part of that
        - Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me
        - um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?
        - Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks
        - and where in the passage STUDENT, can we find one of those
        - Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists
        - yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3
        - hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on STUDENT could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer
        - Yes, and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text, which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph?
        - and where they found the evidence in the tax alright
        - Could you tell me where you found that in the text
        - STUDENT could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand
        - No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope
        - Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used
        - STUDENT What in the text drove you to your answer
        - Right so STUDENT where in the text did you find the microscope?
        - STUDENT have you found were in the story you want us to focus on
        - Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that STUDENT because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text
        - That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that STUDENT
        - STUDENT yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text
        - Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either Oliver or STUDENT read that sentence for us?
        - I saw you STUDENT had some consensus
        - So why don't we start with Oliver and STUDENT
        - Thank you, thank you
        - Can you tell us where in the text STUDENT you found this information?
        - Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text
        - Our items, did STUDENT see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found
        - I'm seeing a shake head from STUDENT
        - And what made you think that from the passage?
        - it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?
        - Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence
        - STUDENT where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?
        - Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us
        - awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence
        - hard to find an answer from
        - Shall we just go back and see together since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that so STUDENT, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from
        - How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph
        - but what did the text makes you think that was the answer
        - Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?
        - Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that
        - so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?
        - did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable
        - yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with STUDENT so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different
        - Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine
        - mm hmm that's true and where's STUDENT Do you remember, where the microscope part was
        - so STUDENT, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater
        - Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment
        - Okay, and do you have a specific sentence
        - Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence
        - Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident
        - What paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere STUDENT
        - Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and
        - Can you read that sentence, do you have it circle in your APP
        - Oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text
        - yeah and then STUDENT quick quick update with you what part of the reading, did you find that in
        - So STUDENT was that answer directly from the text first
        - yeah So could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out? So where did you find that information in this text?
        - so STUDENT, could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope
        - can you tell me where in the text you see the word small machine
        - and did you circle that sentence in the text
        - Oliver what you circle, you said you circle, the same thing as STUDENT, can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled
        - Absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic So what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy
        - Would you mind, did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge
        - So you found that from the text right
        - And where did you read that
        - um, I also would like to know what you STUDENT circled in the text
        - I know that you guys have formulated some answers, but what what led you to your answers? STUDENT
        - You got your answer from did you did you circle, a certain part of the text where their context clues
        - That is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters
        - yeah so um So yes, it definitely is a small machine, but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer
        - um, can you tell me why did you decide to say the word microscope like where did you find that
        - Great and what makes you say that where did you find that information
        - STUDENT Maybe you can tell us, can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope
        - and that was in the tax STUDENT, can you tell me where in the text you found those words hydrogen and oxygen
        - and so I wonder, can you tell us where he where did you find that part in the text he STUDENT yeah
        - um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does STUDENT have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to
        - Okay, can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three
        - so STUDENT, do you see oxygen tanks in this text
        - Why did you give us this answer? where do you find it in the text?
        - So i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph, what evidence, do you use to your answer?
        - So actually, and where did you find this answer?
        - yeah yeah just in the following sentence, right
        - Now, I just want to discuss what made you circle, the answer that you did? okay
        - Oh that's STUDENT true right, so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um, can I ask did they, did you see the ma- any of what you saw mentioned in the text?
        - oxygen tank, how do you get that from text
        - Someone mentioned, is that scientist need an oxygen tanks, can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can STUDENT tell me about please
        - They did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew
        - Right, so what would we be looking at in the text, what did it say that we would have to be looking at
        - Interesting, can you tell me where you found that in the article
        - STUDENT, can you show me where you found that in the article
- intent: r230.3
  examples: |
        - So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome
        - yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different
        - So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it
        - So Farrah and STUDENT, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together
        - and STUDENT i'll be with you in just a second
        - Oh okay STUDENT You said something like that didn't you
        - and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this
        - so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right
        - But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you STUDENT sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers
        - They can use what's on the man
        - That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there
        - Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water
        - And also, STUDENT was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it
        - Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel
        - From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there
        - Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, back to STUDENT
        - So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well
        - You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using STUDENT the other equipment
        - You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space
        - Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment
        - So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks
        - I appreciate that
        - I do agree with you
        - We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but
        - That we haven't seen it yet
        - And so, carrying STUDENT that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,
        - Am I correct STUDENT is that you're thinking
        - Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry STUDENT that weight if we had access to water on the moon
        - We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead
        - And that would make it valuable to us
        - You said that you use the microscope to look closely
        - I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - He said he thought it was in paragraph three
        - Okay, so, STUDENT just gave us an excellent answer
        - She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from STUDENT
        - Thank you for raising your hand so Farrah thought it was in paragraph three, and STUDENT thought it was in paragraph two,
        - Um, you said using a small machine, STUDENT
        - You did correct your answer, but your answer
        - And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter
        - She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Perfect so answering that STUDENT answered it perfectly
        - You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more
        - Yes, that would be an option to maybe STUDENT Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read
        - So, STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - And that's true
        - Let's take care of that
        - Let's then switch track
        - Let's see here
        - So let's take a look right now
        - You got it STUDENT figured out
        - We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - STUDENT I'm excited to hear
        - So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there
        - You talk about a to look really close
        - Your answer isn't ready yet
        - It's not ready yet
        - To us yet
        - So you said the water is not ready to eat
        - Is that what you're trying to say
        - So I just wanted to clarify that
        - I can't remember who said it but you have saving way
        - I think it was STUDENT right
        - So are STUDENT these things we just talked about that have value
        - Right, are STUDENT of these things, able to be done with water
        - Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes
        - So these are STUDENT the things that you should listen
        - So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope STUDENT looked
        - STUDENT of these are good pieces of information from our passage
        - At the craters on the moon and STUDENT was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine
        - So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found STUDENT, what did you want to add
        - Did they use to discover
        - Okay, what equipment
        - She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things
        - So STUDENT is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon
        - So STUDENT also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage
        - Okay, what I understand that your answer was scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So it would be good, that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship
        - So that is very good thinking,
        - That is very true
        - They could have room for other things
        - Yes, water is heavy
        - Machine was sent to investigate
        - Okay, so whenever the astronauts have to go into space, there's no oxygen in space
        - So they have to have an oxygen tank and a mask and things like that to be able to survive when they go into space
        - Does that make sense?
        - Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water
        - And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet
        - I'm jab and STUDENT you both wrote no to this answer
        - STUDENT has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and
        - And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we STUDENT need water to drink
        - Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,
        - Yeah, they did
        - They need a lot of tools
        - They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen
        - Yes, and you are exactly right
        - They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon
        - You STUDENT said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable
        - So I see that Oliver and STUDENT
        - Yes, and I completely agree
        - And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but
        - It will take a long time
        - You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - You definitely can't
        - Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer
        - That is very true
        - So it is very valuable to have the water
        - And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - Also see where STUDENT, he added, kind of onto your answer
        - So we need oxygen
        - I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space
        - NASA sent a small machine
        - They said that they wanted a microscope
        - Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that STUDENT?
        - So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely
        - So let's go ahead and get into those answers
        - Okay, well that's perfect STUDENT
        - So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important
        - Let's see, Farrah and STUDENT, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true
        - Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else STUDENT?
        - Um, let's see
        - So those are very important things
        - You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - STUDENT You said water can be
        - See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture
        - So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct
        - Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there
        - So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat
        - Right, so that
        - So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now
        - Um, so, STUDENT, you said not for a long time
        - read what you wrote your STUDENT
        - Is that right, is that what you meant by that
        - Why it's going to take a long time
        - So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now
        - That is exactly right
        - We do need water to survive
        - And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said
        - You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - You can't survive without water
        - You said water is is heavy
        - So it's good
        - Yeah, I was trying to get to that
        - So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there
        - They don't have to carry it and ships anymore
        - Okay, so let's let's think about your answer
        - So you said they use Microsoft's correct
        - Is that right,
        - Oliver, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm STUDENT
        - But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer
        - You said that you could
        - Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there
        - When you said that
        - So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph
        - And I, I want to ask another question
        - Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle
        - Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks
        - I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Alright so Miss STUDENT
        - Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs
        - There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable
        - So you are right in the fact that it is heavy
        - And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource
        - It takes up a lot of room
        - Okay, well, we'll go over yours too
        - So you mentioned a small machine
        - Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water
        - I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well
        - And I agree with you, STUDENT
        - So the two verbs here where
        - Okay, so let's take about
        - Farrah and Oliver, both of STUDENT kind of said no it's not ready
        - There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time
        - So it's good
        - And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy
        - They don't have to curate in the ships anymore
        - So I guess with your answer
        - They found water
        - That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so
        - You're kind of saying that it's important
        - And so, STUDENT, you've mentioned that it will be a long time
        - It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water
        - In other words, it's not available right away
        - Yeah, and that's certainly very true
        - Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important
        - Astronauts have to carry it in space
        - That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry STUDENT
        - And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now
        - But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable
        - So that's very useful
        - So that's a very good observation on your part STUDENT
        - And then if they didn't have to carry STUDENT the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people
        - That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food
        - And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you
        - That's a great idea
        - It has no value, right
        - So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it
        - You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water
        - and so STUDENT You mentioned that you can see water puddles
        - That's a use STUDENT those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do
        - So it's something that
        - What about you, Demi
        - Needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right
        - So there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have
        - Okay, so they're making statements to make you believe something
        - And that's something that's valuable to them because we STUDENT have to have water to stay hydrated
        - You're very good drink it
        - Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right
        - So back to STUDENT
        - And I think, STUDENT, you said you had the same answers her
        - STUDENT, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon
        - you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward
        - Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive
        - Um, it would be very expensive
        - Okay, well, good job, for sure
        - Just because we don't really have STUDENT there but
        - Yes, yes, it's so you are correct
        - Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable
        - Chris you STUDENT are on the same page
        - Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future
        - You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon
        - Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?
        - We can't see it with our
        - Okay, so it's really, really, really, really, really, really small
        - So let's think about putting STUDENT of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us
        - We know that the
        - So we're going to put STUDENT of this together
        - Right, that we found on the moon
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits
        - Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine
        - You can do some cool stuff with it and STUDENT actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it
        - The astronauts and so water is very heavy on
        - Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts
        - Is that true
        - It sounds like you think, yes
        - Yes you do say yes answers
        - There's an exclamation point
        - So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it
        - So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe
        - So you put no, not for a long time
        - So you're saying no
        - Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Waters, so it's good
        - They don't have to Carry it in the ships anymore
        - And you read that in the text, that's fine
        - Water is heavy
        - Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable
        - Now the STUDENT has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water
        - So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope
        - Some of our other answers
        - So let's look so STUDENT, you said that the small machine
        - You said the microscope
        - Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and STUDENT
        - And we have a microscope
        - So we're looking so we've narrowed it down
        - We have our small machine
        - So, so we know that ice is the water
        - Okay, so that's very good
        - We're going to keep that in the back of our brains
        - We know that the water that we find is very small
        - So where we're thinking about how small the water is
        - Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again
        - So we know Chris oh sorry Oliver and STUDENT, let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon
        - So, very good, very good
        - Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space
        - So we have water we have equipment
        - And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title
        - Why the microscope is not the answer
        - So it comes first in the story
        - And then we use the microscope to identify the water
        - And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable
        - I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable
        - So looking at Question two
        - We can also use the oxygen for breathing
        - STUDENT, we can use the water for drinking
        - And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now
        - And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important
        - Right, so we can use it to breathe as well
        - We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what
        - Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it
        - I think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do STUDENT these different things, especially if we can put a moon base on the moon
        - So I think, I think you STUDENT have it
        - Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one
        - and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic
        - You are welcome and, STUDENT, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon
        - Yeah, so, STUDENT, you talked about the microscope
        - So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in STUDENT You had mentioned equipment they had been used
        - One question for you STUDENT
        - And so, so we know the water, the water is there
        - I mean, STUDENT you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon
        - So that was two of the ways that they could use it
        - And as the fuel if they break it into two parts
        - So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink
        - Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic
        - The question is this
        - Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads
        - Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer
        - So you have the same answer As STUDENT
        - You do use a microscope to actually see the water
        - So I'd like to dress you both at the same time
        - So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was
        - So we know that they sent up that small machine and STUDENT, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water
        - And STUDENT, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So I think you STUDENT are on the right track with that and then Chris and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used
        - So it looks like so far, Farrah, and STUDENT
        - Okay, that's a good job
        - You STUDENT have both talked about equipment
        - And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail
        - So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine
        - They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        - Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon
        - So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can
        - They don't have to put that water on the rocket
        - So you're right that water isn't ready yet
        - Like what you've done, you got to that last paragraph, where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water
        - They're going to have to Oliverelop a plan to extract water so it can be used
        - And I love how you STUDENT are trying to think about this
        - Both of these things up
        - So let me help you with this
        - You are so close
        - You're telling me that I can split
        - To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon
        - We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen
        - So hydrogen and oxygen
        - STUDENT You said that those two elements are can be broken apart
        - Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart
        - You're left with hydrogen and oxygen
        - And, and then I loved and STUDENT, you said that there was craters full of water on the moon
        - And STUDENT told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet
        - Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do
        - It is very heavy
        - now, Farrah, and Oliver you STUDENT mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water
        - STUDENT, you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon
        - let's think about oxygen
        - yeah so you STUDENT kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there
        - mm hmm so you and STUDENT had the same idea
        - Jazmin and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and STUDENT thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it
        - Okay STUDENT so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right
        - Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right
        - Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right
        - And we'll start with a STUDENT this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct
        - that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah
        - Okay, so Oliver and Farrah you STUDENT did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um
        - So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine Jazmin, but STUDENT was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope
        - So we're using your background knowledge on the word
        - And like tool you like
        - So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct
        - Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff
        - And Oliver your response was just comparing to STUDENT is which was a great point
        - She was absolutely correct
        - Thanks guys alright so STUDENT we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs
        - so we know that STUDENT said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin
        - So Farrah and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned -actually STUDENT you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used
        - Farrah you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so STUDENT yes
        - So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with STUDENT
        - let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to Luis's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did
        - so, as I was just saying to STUDENT she said that for in the future astronauts can
        - Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon STUDENT
        - That is Farrah and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a STUDENT
        - Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space
        - You think it's the microscope
        - yeah so STUDENT and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you
        - yeah a STUDENT is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine
        - i'm seeing a pattern here, we STUDENT like the microscope in the orbiter
        - All right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and I want you to miss one you said I circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?
        - But what we did with STUDENT
        - If you remember, if I had STUDENT Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really
        - Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more
        - and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because
        - If they do have that room on the ship, it would be very valuable because they could store more things, which is what it says in
        - The text so that's a great response
        - so you said okay well STUDENT said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the
        - i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon
        - awesome okay so STUDENT looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so
        - awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?
        - So, STUDENT you answered with NASA send a small machine
        - So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine
        - And that tells me that you understood it
        - And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it
        - OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about
        - That's, that's really good
        - So you saw equipment in the discussion question
        - And you highlighted the microscope, just like STUDENT
        - that's awesome so what STUDENT told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And then, what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right
        - You actually talked about microscopes, which help the scientists to see things closer, is that, sure, you said that right in your response
        - I noticed that in your response
        - You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I saw that in your answer
        - Yes, so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen, STUDENT that's very true that is good observation
        - How is what STUDENT said, change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged, she said, the oil better product strategy part to get
        - So what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and I love that I love
        - place, I really like that, and I agree, so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right
        - To look really closely
        - Remember how we talked
        - So is there
        - To STUDENT earlier and gave her some suggestions
        - Okay, so let's look at your answers STUDENT so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right
        - So you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - You said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated
        - So does STUDENT want to-- actually, OK
        - One second, STUDENT
        - So STUDENT, for example, you said that they used a microscope to look really closely, right?
        - Nice so are you also having the same ideas STUDENT where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym
        - Oliver you agree Jazmin you agree STUDENT you agree, I also agree as well, that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely
        - So, STUDENT, you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research?
        - Right, they would need water to drink
        - So, STUDENT, you made the point That maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it
        - So you STUDENT said microscope
        - So the astronauts can what with it
        - So we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much
        - That you had originally thought maybe the water isn't going to be that useful
        - Yeah, I think I agree with you, if there were astronauts, they would, they would have to be astronaut suits and oxygen tanks
        - Farrah and STUDENT, I see that you have identified a tool used by the scientists to see things that are very small
        - From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water
        - And are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money
        - That the amount of money that we put into invest in this, we won't get returns
        - And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you
        - So Oliver and Farrah think that it was the microscope in Jazmin and STUDENT Both think it was the lunar orbiter
        - So Chris is saying that you STUDENT are both right that they use the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter
        - It sounds like you're talking about the machine that they used to travel to the moon
        - So STUDENT, I'm hearing that You think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships
        - Seemed to be very strong you you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and that you need
        - So I'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to STUDENT
        - STUDENT, is it you?
        - And I think someone else have listen guessing with you
        - She said the machine that discovered was a small machine, right
        - And so, Chris do you notice what STUDENT just said
        - Teacher : And Oliver, I saw that you said you circle, the same as STUDENT
        - Teacher : Awesome and STUDENT
        - I saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so you talked about water and how there was craters on the moon
        - Okay, so you circled equipment and you knew that a microscope was in a tool that was used for equipment
        - Right, so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space
        - So you found the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope
        - So, you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, but it was ice right
        - Okay, so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, and then STUDENT, you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right
        - Right, so the name of that small machine, you just said is a lunar orbiter
        - So, STUDENT shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something
        - To go around, right
        - So what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water
        - Than you you were able to use the context of your microscope, which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces
        - So STUDENT mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny
        - So that's a very, very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer
        - I love that answer
        - So it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used
        - It's not specific to the text right
        - So I noticed that STUDENT told me She was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything
        - Right, so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe, breathe, but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon
        - So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment
        - STUDENT, you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely
        - So you said NASA sent like a small machine
        - Yeah, and member STUDENT had said that they sent a small machine to investigate
        - And STUDENT I see that you wrote scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - You also said that NASA sent a small machine
        - Now, let's see, STUDENT
        - I really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So I work from STUDENT the different students that each student found a different tool to use
        - Now some of you wrote that, um, the microscope was used to discover the water
        - So we need to find information from the text that is convincing to support Our answer of water on the moon being valuable,
        - Yes, that is another meaningful valuable important or something worth worth
        - Great while Luis is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side, so Farrah and Oliver I noticed that, once again, you STUDENT must have worked together, because you have some similar answers
        - so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right
        - so you wrote about water being heavy
        - yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say
        - Okay, so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon
        - I know that you get it
        - I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon
        - Yeah, no, STUDENT, got it
        - And it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right
        - Also, it's also good
        - So there was a small machine
        - So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water
        - Yeah, they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system
        - Yeah you and STUDENT both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts
        - So you really focus on the word microscope, that's something that you really focused on
        - And so STUDENT why don't we actually start with you, I noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that right
        - STUDENT i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that right
        - And while they're talking Oliver and Farrah I noticed you STUDENT circle, the same thing is that right
        - yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Definitely, so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find- they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it
        - Is that correct?
        - Oh STUDENT okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - STUDENT um, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right?
        - so you and STUDENT were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks
        - How great so you STUDENT have the same answer in the end that they use the Lunar orbiter
        - Okay STUDENT so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so
        - so what I would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with
        - We want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned, and your response STUDENT that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right?
        - So you know, I think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly, we may not catch STUDENT of these really fine details, I also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead
        - and I would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals
        - Farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil
        - So STUDENT so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon
        - And as STUDENT was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes
        - so um Farrah I saw I know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and I love that you notice that, from what are one of the other paragraphs, the third paragraph right, it was Farrah and Oliver you STUDENT found that in the third paragraph yeah?
        - Um STUDENT I liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things, but in the future, we might be able to
        - Just like you said STUDENT right?
        - and you know I think deb also had a similar response right death
        - So you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the Lunar orbiter to clarify
        - STUDENT, you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, correct?
        - That was your answer correct?
        - STUDENT so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science STUDENT and bringing it to this discussion right?
        - right they do and that's exactly what STUDENT told me right so Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?
        - STUDENT, you said that you have used a microscope before right?
        - um so Oliver and Farrah, i'm going to come back to you STUDENT
        - I want to combine STUDENT to answer with Luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the Lunar orbiter was a Chris was 100% correct when he said it's there to investigate right
        - You said that NASA census small machine
        - Going back to you i'm wondering, do you see STUDENT so Jazmin talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon does that sound like something that maybe
        - now in the microscope part this is kind of what Farrah and STUDENT were pointing out
        - Yes, perfect so ice is water
        - So um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon
        - Yeah that's true very good point
        - Ok so you both said the small machine
        - and STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening
        - Soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter
        - awesome comment from STUDENT
        - So the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree, yes, that this thing was used to investigate it, but we still need the microscope to look closely at it
        - That they need the Lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me I love that you mentioned that and then you STUDENT brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks
        - STUDENT is telling us that in paragraph three, there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see
        - STUDENT pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called
        - He shared that they use these tools and the Lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use
        - Okay, so I want to circle back to STUDENT Farrah
        - And also that actually ties into Luis's experience Luis knows STUDENT about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right, even
        - Paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right
        - And then, it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools, who may just think that it was a scientific tool, the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but
        - So you thought about Jazmin's answer and then
        - Jazmin told us that it was a small machine and STUDENT added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon,
        - deb I think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right
        - so STUDENT thought that it could be valuable
        - Water yeah that's that makes water so um STUDENT said that scientists found creators, full of water on moon right is that what you read hi Chris
        - so STUDENT I noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment
        - Okay, so you have identify a bit I identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by, it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration
        - And STUDENT has also identified a benefit so let's hear what Jazmin had to say
        - Okay, think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration
        - I really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration, whereas the other people like Dave and someone I have talked about the costs of this exploration
        - Awesome, yes equipment right
        - So now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment, right?
        - So you just told me when the scientists found the ice already, and then they couldn't see it
        - Great and STUDENT talked about the oxygen tanks right?
        - so let's take a look at some of your answers STUDENT and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - answer too, he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, so they used STUDENT the that equipment and the eating that terrible food
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA sent a small machine to go get that water
        - Well, I don't know if i'd call it a machine, but you, you talked about a scientific tool right
        - yeah they could drink it and then like STUDENT said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water  To get some air, so that they can breathe right
        - So yeah, we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon, are there any other tools
        - hmm so investigate right find right are great words, Oliver the same thing that you said, right STUDENT of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right
        - Oliver, about the investigators, right and Farrah about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and Luis about STUDENT the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use,
        - mm hmm Okay, so this is actually perfect for both you Farrah and STUDENT since you had very similar answers
        - I love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right, but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job STUDENT really good work
        - Alright, everyone, I think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something STUDENT Can you help me oh
        - Great yes, so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question  right it gives us a piece of equipment, the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something STUDENT
        - right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words
        - This is a great start, we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence STUDENT
        - STUDENT you mentioned a microscope right?
        - so um STUDENT was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes, she did not the right answer, but she needs to be more specific, so I just looked at her sentence
        - that's awesome STUDENT
        - yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope
        - STUDENT you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right
        - tool that's a good one yeah so tool, a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job Farrah and STUDENT, I saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment
        - yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool, something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there
        - So a machine is another word for equipment that's a great
        - So just to remind STUDENT for equipment, we have a tool, a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment
        - Find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then STUDENT I saw your hand go up what did you come up with Luis
        - yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time, so you're finding it for the first time, good thanks STUDENT in depth, those are really good words to point up
        - yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it, or you don't know if it's there, and you uncover it that's very good yes
        - Like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle
        - so you're saying we know we need to discover something so maybe it's a good
        - Okay um so STUDENT your answer was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right
        - Okay, so very good, so this is about you found the part in the text right about them locating the craters and that's the location right that's where was this water right but
        - yeah just like what STUDENT just the said
        - I noticed that Farrah and STUDENT, then they also named the equipment but a different one
        - actually even said something about that in his answer didn't he that scientists use a lot of equipment, including oxygen tanks, which is totally right
        - And it's the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon, so I think that's a great full answer Farrah and STUDENT that's awesome
        - What else did we do Do you remember when we were talking before about STUDENT's strategy, what else did Farrah do to make sure that she was answering the question completely
        - We went back to the text and we looked for evidence right  what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering
        - Was yes absolutely Okay, so we picked up some important keywords in that question right
        - whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters
        - Okay, so you know that microscope is a piece of equipment and you see that in paragraph three Nice
        - brought up that that the scientific tool they use was called a microscope to look really closely at the water, because on that microscopes do really help us see things up close
        - I really like um how you
        - i'm actually STUDENT, you also had a really great answer to you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon, and I thought that came really, really close to answering the question as well
        - And then STUDENT you also had a great response, where you had that NASA sent a small machine
        - Exactly STUDENT and um I think what your answer focused on more of is what they could do with the water once they discover it right like there was an interesting video I saw
        - and Oliver and Farrah you STUDENT brought up that there were those ice deposits in the craters and they used the microscope to look at that even closer to discover
        - hmm you know that's really interesting point because it's true that when humans go to the moon, they definitely need oxygen tanks to breathe
        - let's see so your answer you revised answer STUDENT was that scientists found is using a small machine Is that correct
        - cool so we've had a couple of comments from you about equipment we've had scientists use a lot of equipment and then we have scientists found the ice using a small machine
        - You would revise your revisions, so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon, using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic Is that correct
        - Look at STUDENT the words in the question okay
        - That you had just forgot to to include that in your answer, perhaps
        - and your answer is scientists use the Lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water
        - Okay, great so i'm hearing that you have heard, STUDENT talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do, and you tried that and it worked out yeah
        - Okay, so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match, and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about
        - Hello i'm happy to be back with you all, and I believe that we left off trying to add some more to Jazmin's response trying to strengthen it, and I know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the Lunar orbiter and I think that we, yes STUDENT?
        - So the moon, we said
        - So space exploration and finding water on space, there are a lot of steps and processes that come with that right and and Jazmin you you touch on a really important part of that, as do Farrah and STUDENT
        - yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes, these are STUDENT really important pieces of equipment that allow NASA scientists to look at water on the moon
        - yeah that's great so i'm glad that we have some agreement so so so far, the words that we've talked about our equipment and discover and water on the moon
        - Okay, so now going back to what STUDENT was saying he mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in general, which is great
        - And just very quickly so vana brought up the idea that she said that it was a microscope was used to find the water and then we're talking with STUDENT about the small machine that she identified in the text so we're going to start there but
        - so I know that we're talking with Jazmin when we left off and Jazmin also said that she agreed with what STUDENT said That the microscope is used to look at the water on the moon
        - and we already talked about how the microscope was used to look at the water, and we also talked about how the Lunar orbiter was used to find water
        - but let's just go back to the first thing you said so, you said that Oh yes, the Lunar orbiter is looking for the ice deposits on the moon, so do you agree or disagree with what STUDENT said
        - So Jazmin STUDENT pointed out one, and then you also pointed out another one similar to Farrah, which was a microscope correct
        - yeah they are really been a you're correct, so you had mentioned that you visit a NASA before correct and so out of STUDENT
        - so let's think back to your answer, because your answer says that they found craters full of water on the moon
        - which is a microscope correct
        - Oliver and STUDENT I see that you guys had a similar answer right Farrah, you said that you i'm in your answer you talked about a microscope as a scientific tool to look really closely and they've used to that you circled the same thing, for your
        - And so let's just keep those words in our heads, as we talk through this so we've got what type of equipment and STUDENT you mentioned a machine
        - And then STUDENT you use that word tool
        - Chris tells us what the scientists were doing on the moon Luis knows STUDENT these different types of equipment that scientists use that maybe aren't mentioned in the text
        - And then STUDENT you just identified for us a specific piece of equipment that the article mentions is us on the moon when scientists are looking for water
        - So that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer, and then I also liked what Oliver and Farrah mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead STUDENT
        - And so I think that we've got two folks who said, no one person who said yes and then two people answered by talking through some of the evidence
        - yeah, and so I think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like Oliver and Farrah said what might happen in the future is what STUDENT just said
        - I think you bring up this good point that, even though it might not be ready now the value might be there in the future
        - About how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe
        - yeah and so kind of tying what Chris read back to what STUDENT was asking like why isn't that answer correct that it's not ready to be used yet
        - Oh OK, so the part about equipment, I agree, I think that is a key part of the question that we might need to dig into to figure out the answers we need to go back to the article
        - That is true right so it's similar to kind of Farrah's thinking as well right?
        - So you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right
        - something you used to do something so let's use our understanding what Jazmin and STUDENT gave us a tour, something we used to do something
        - and I noticed in STUDENT knows i'm explanation, she said, a scientific
        - So STUDENT gave us a really, really awesome response and said that NASA use the small machine
        - yeah so STUDENT was her answer was a little different
        - yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the Lunar orbiter and then STUDENT said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there, so that's why yeah
        - And so, as Chris pointed out, they with the equipment that they use they made the craters to find the water and then STUDENT also gave us some context, saying that they use the small machine
        - You started to explain how machine was being sent
        - I see how you've answered the question is water valuable because right now there isn't any water there, so you said no, not yet
        - so STUDENT, you had said waters is heavy so it's hard to bring it up in ships right it's A lot of weight for the spaceship to bring
        - and STUDENT you had said that water is something they can drink to stay hydrated right
        - Which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon, just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there
        - for drinking and like STUDENT had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer
        - and STUDENT is that right that that's what you had as well
- intent: r110.2
  examples: |
        - Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        - It is, I didn't say it was wrong
        - The only person STUDENT is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable
        - Um, we definitely need oxygen
        - When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here
        - Your, your answer is not wrong
        - You need a microscope to be able
        - You could if there's enough water
        - Well, STUDENT, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct
        - STUDENT I want to go back to your answer
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And that is very, very true,
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water,
        - I like the connection you made there
        - I'm so glad that you could clarify
        - So you weren't wrong at STUDENT
        - They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water
        - They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here
        - So you said
        - Your answer isn't wrong
        - You STUDENT said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question
        - They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?
        - That's a good connection STUDENT
        - Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you STUDENT read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right
        - Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely
        - So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - You're right about that
        - So, it is a small machine that is correct
        - So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use STUDENT that equipment to get to space
        - You are correct
        - And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out
        - And I did
        - And STUDENT once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well
        - So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text
        - And that is correct
        - That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts STUDENT
        - I think what Chris Jazmin and Luis I think you STUDENT you read the text and you understood the text
        - Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon
        - So, you are right
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - That's a very good answer
        - Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and STUDENT the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water
        - So yes, that's something really good to add STUDENT
        - And I see it's the microscope
        - Very good, very good
        - Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        - You STUDENT seem to be hitting a lot of this
        - And I think STUDENT did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that
        - Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon
        - It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so STUDENT talk
        - Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading
        - Now, they discovered the water
        - You got that right on the nose
        - I would say that a lot better answers the question
        - And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect
        - We might include how those
        - So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        - I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there
        - You got a lot closer there
        - That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right
        - What is that small machine called
        - A small machine, right, perfect
        - So, which is a good thing
        - So you're both right
        - That's great about working in groups
        - We STUDENT participate and contribute
        - You just didn't have the--
        - Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and STUDENT good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours
        - So you're both right
        - So they did using what they,
        - I liked your answers
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air
        - And if you don't have the heavy water
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - Your answer was never wrong Jazmin's original answer was that scientist
        - So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong
        - You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - That's a very good point
        - And they did
        - I would like to see if STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Oh, that would be awesome
        - That is very good thinking
        - Yes, that is correct
        - And no one's answer is wrong
        - Do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further
        - Well, it's not wrong
        - but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - Okay, so you're right, they do use equipment and that was part of the question
        - And they can use the water for other things like a garden, like you said, so yes
        - but you STUDENT were right there at it so so
        - Did you know the name of this orbiter?
        - That was a really cool answer that you gave, but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before
        - I did notice that you you pointed out, the oxygen tanks
        - So you have to have those tanks to help you breathe
        - Well, it definitely helped them because you know in space
        - So that was one equipment that they did use
        - There's not a lot of oxygen
        - Well, that was right too
        - Because they did send a small machine called think I was a probe Or something
        - We could, and then I guess you would say that it would be a good investment because they would could grow things out side of the planet, but
        - So I mean he's not wrong,
        - Okay, thank you
        - Okay, they use several types of of of equipment
        - Okay, I am sorry that you believe that your answer is wrong
        - Your everybody's answer is
        - Your answer is very right they did use a microscope
        - Let's figure answers STUDENT, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, you are correct Miss savanna, you need a microscope to look very closely
        - That is equipment, you're correct
        - They have to use STUDENT those things before they can start their explorations
        - That is right STUDENT
        - We're getting a little bit off topic here, but STUDENT you said that astronauts have to use oxygen tanks in space shuttles, and those are types of equipment so you're right about that
        - It would and it would be really useful too
        - STUDENT What about you
        - So it might not be worked at
        - But you're right, it will take a lot of time and a lot of money
        - I think so as well water too because we're looking at what was what equipment was used to to find water there any other important words
        - So NASA did sent a small machine, correct?
        - We're just wanting to find kind of even more
        - No, your answer isn't wrong
        - OK? About it
        - Oh, I didn't say that
        - So they sent mall machine
        - You're exactly right
        - That's the tool that we're looking for
        - That's very good
        - I'm so sorry that I missed your, your answer
        - And it does say that, um, does it
        - So are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found?
        - Yes, it was the microscope
        - Does everybody see where STUDENT found that in paragraph three?
        - Did everybody hear that while STUDENT was reading
        - That was a wonderful answer
        - Does STUDENT else want to add their answer to it
        - Your answer is correct because the microscope is a tool
        - Now equipment is is very broad when comes two machines and tools and what you refer to them as
        - Your answer is not, I wouldn't say that it's wrong
        - Um, yeah, I don't think that it's wrong
        - Your answer is not wrong, STUDENT
        - Well, I don't think that you're wrong
        - And so it's not that your answer is incorrect,
        - So what you could also include is that scientists use a tool called a microscope to discover water on the moon,
        - Your answer is correct
        - Correct they did have to use the equipment so STUDENT and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks, but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters
        - I'm not going to say your response was wrong by any means
        - So you answer that that NASA send a small machine
        - Maybe your answer is right
        - And so if we look at what was written, actually, you can look at number two on there
        - I didn't say your answer was wrong
        - So your answer was right
        - That they said that small machine a lunar orbiter is a type of machine
        - It's not that your answers are wrong
        - Those are different types of equipment that scientists use
        - So you STUDENT are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment, help them discover water
        - You did a really good job at stating that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - It could be something that we drink it could be something that we could use to stay clean
        - You did a great job with with understanding what water is even
        - How can it be valuable for us on the moon
        - Those are great job, STUDENT
        - Yeah, we can use it to drink, we can use it to bake
        - And that is a great answer
        - I mean, it is a small machine it, you're, you're still correct
        - Well, that would definitely you know really come in handy for any, you know, scientists or astrologers who might perhaps be on the moon
        - So that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon
        - But it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of, you know, sort of some greenhouses, that we might be able to construct on the moon
        - just like STUDENT brought up about space
        - He knows this is not just about equipment but about space
        - He's looking into it
        - When I looked over your answer
        - It wasn't that it wasn't wrong
        - It is what it is
        - There was some great points you brought about it
        - So I loved your response, about the word you used, use the word hydrate, did you use hydrate STUDENT, you said it again?
        - And that's a good connection
        - I like that response because that's something you're proving to me whenever I asked you about the garden
        - What makes you think you could, and you're telling me
        - I thought that was a great idea to be you
        - Look at that
        - I'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes, because it's heavy
        - And there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had
        - Yes, good response
        - So maybe there was there's probably more than just one thing used to find this water,
        - Okay, you know what, STUDENT I
        - That sounds like a good point
        - And we STUDENT gave really good answers
        - So your, your answer is not wrong
        - Does that help you understand more
        - I'm in paragraph three, it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it
        - So I think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon
        - But nothing's wrong with your paragraph
        - This pretty good, but that is definitely one of the lunar orbiter does
        - That's absolutely true so far
        - So right now, your answer seems pretty solid
        - So, STUDENT, your answer's, I don't think your answer is incorrect
        - Your answer's your answer is correct
        - Yeah, that's a great point
        - So, um, yes, they would have had to use these oxygen tanks and stuff to go out and actually explore the moon
        - So yeah, you would need that equipment
        - STUDENT your answer is not necessarily wrong
        - You're in again your answers, not necessarily wrong
        - And that's definitely true scientists did find craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that
        - Yes, you, you went right into you said scientists want crater some water on the moon
        - So I think you STUDENT
        - You STUDENT are correct in stating that both of those things, the microscope and
        - So, uh, equipment is a tool
        - The small machine are both equipment they are tools
        - And in fact, our article today discusses the importance of oxygen
        - And I appreciate you sharing that with us
        - And that is absolutely correct
        - So STUDENT your answer That they can drink water and stay hydrated is a very good answer
        - And it is mentioned here in the text
        - So you were extremely, extremely close
        - They didn't use machinery
        - I think whenever we talked about the question you get to find out that you're actually went wrong
        - I'm not saying I'm not saying it's wrong
        - You weren't wrong after STUDENT
        - So like STUDENT said they do use equipment like oxygen and tanks to get to the moon and be able to survive on the moon
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        - Your answer isn't wrong
        - All right, STUDENT, and it's not wrong
        - STUDENT Can you share what you underlined in paragraph two,
        - Okay well we're going to get to that in one second
        - We're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it
        - So you said that they needed a tool called the microscope to look really closely and that is true
        - We need that special tool called a microscope to see these little microscopic, whatever it ends up being, in this case it's microscopic amounts of water
        - So in essence kind of both of them are correct
        - In reality, I'm not sure any teacher would count it wrong, myself included, if you put  Every bit of it
        - You know, if you put the lunar order and the microscope and just about anything
        - I don't think I'd counted wrong because technically that is correct
        - Every little bit that us to get to the moon and find the water is technically correct
        - Yeah, so I would say based on our text here, they've used different equipment to discover that there was water on the moon
        - You look at paragraph three, you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope
        - Good job, STUDENT is exactly right
        - In fact, it is the microscope and part of the answers is right, it is the microscope
        - And your answer is right
        - I will say, STUDENT
        - Hmm, I suppose it's in a large polar crater, right? Okay now your answer is correct, they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit
        - Okay, now in the test we did hear about how you might need a microscope to view this this these water molecules
        - With your answer is not wrong
        - Okay, so that could be a one use of water
        - So I love how you found that a microscope was used to find water,
        - so you said you are 100% correct and it said NASA send a small machine
        - Everybody's answer was correct
        - I don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at STUDENT
        - It was a small machine
        - but you guys STUDENT gave answers that were very valid
        - yeah it was a good answer
        - yeah no that's a very well Olivereloped answer
        - but as long as we gathered STUDENT of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct, whether or not you think it is or not
        - I really did enjoy your answer
        - You really picked up from the text and
        - I'm just going to go one by one
        - I just want to start with you
        - You really picked the object, which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that I really appreciate it
        - Your answer was right that the scientists did find craters full water on the moon
        - I don't think your answer is wrong, we did read that you do need a Microscope to look closely at the moon, maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - I just want to tell you that your answer wasn't wrong
        - yeah yeah and you're definitely correct the scientists in the text, they did find craters of water on the moon
        - Okay, so your answer, I would not say that your answer is wrong, so you said yes water on the moon could be valuable because astronauts drink water
        - That's something we always want to keep with us
        - So in the passage, it does say that there there's evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters which - that's a great piece of knowledge
        - Alright awesome STUDENT I like how you told me how they used the microscope for the water that they found on the moon
        - So how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon What are those use for
        - um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon, they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes
        - equipment that you find whether it's in the text, or you think of it in your head
        - Not necessarily wrong, I think that you did a good job, identifying that the microscope was the equipment and a microscope does look at things closely, but I wanted you to
        - yeah absolutely good job
        - But yeah, this was a good start
        - Yeah, good foundation
        - So yeah, that's kind of how you could have done it
        - You your applied to it was scientists found creators, full of water on the moon, so your sentence isn't wrong and you bring up a good point that
        - um the scientists found for creators, full of water on the moon on
        - So yeah just kind of thinking about more like that, but you did great you know it was it was a good answer you did awesome i'm
        - wow you're you're a super right and that was perfect timing, because your classmate STUDENT his his sentence was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank so two great minds think alike, am I right
        - i'm so STUDENT for your sentence, I have seen anything terrible wrong with it, but
        - yeah um but other than that I, I thank you STUDENT, like all the guys, I think I understood the passages like Well, yes, that
        - yeah that's awesome I see it, right in the second paragraph NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that's a great answer
        - OK, now that is correct
        - I want to make that very clear
        - We're just getting a deeper understanding of why your answers are right
        - No one's wrong
        - STUDENT right, no one's wrong
        - So you said, I know what equipment you need you need a microscope to look really closely, you had the what and the why
        - You picked up wonderfully in the part where they asked what equipment, you would need
        - You're right on what you said
        - Answer is not wrong
        - So your answers not wrong
        - microscope yep that's right
        - Yeah, you are correct
        - Actually, I think I agree with savannas answer
        - I don't necessarily think any one answer was
        - So thank you for sharing Thank you
        - That is really, really cool information, and I know the text references oxygen tanks, too, so that is really awesome for you to bring up Thank you STUDENT
        - yeah That is very true you both do use very specific evidence um
        - They did send a small machine
        - Because, well your answer is not wrong
        - Well, you STUDENT are all definitely right with your answers that you guys that they did use a microscope
        - You guys STUDENT had responses that were definitely
        - So going off that, the equipment that they used to find water on the moon
        - That's really, really cool
        - Yes, Oliver, you said you circled the same as STUDENT
        - You guys were STUDENT mostly right in your responses
        - And that's right, STUDENT did choose a correct objects,
        - I understand that you read the reading because you know that they found craters full of water on the moon, but
        - you're right they definitely do use a lot of equipment like awkward to use to find water that's right
        - you're right they definitely did send a small machine and that's great
        - Again that's the correct answer and you wouldn't need a microscope to look really clearly and the reading did say that
        - Alright, so I know this is a little smaller and I wanted to explain to you guys that before you get worried, I want you guys, to know that your responses were STUDENT great
        - Your answer is totally correct everybody has correct answers in this STUDENT
        - STUDENT your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct
        - STUDENT, the scientists did find craters with ice in them
        - And that is true
        - And in the question asked what machine discovered the water, so your answer is correct,
        - I think STUDENT of you answer the questions
        - I don't think any of your answers are wrong
        - Oh so STUDENT I let's clarify
        - I'm with a different type of answer, but I don't think any of your questions were wrong
        - How are we doing so your response was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is completely true
        - So that's really great
        - Instruments, they used to find the water, which was microscope
        - So let's see your answer was NASA sent a small machine
        - That answer is not incorrect at STUDENT, and I think none of your answers are wrong in any of this case I just think
        - When we read the question, it asked for what specific type of equipment would be used and your answer was correct, but I think to answer the correct
        - um let's look at your you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated, you can't survive without water
        - That is perfectly correct STUDENT and I don't think your answers wrong I just think
        - Right, you just did a really good job using textual evidence to support your answer
        - So that answers the question
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I don't think your answers wrong, I think you have a really, really great start to a strong response so in the text, it does actually say NASA sent a small machine
        - So I think that's a great start yeah awesome
        - Yes, that's exactly what's the word I was looking for
        - They needed a microscope to really, really see what the ice was like
        - backed up why you said, because if you had just said that you put creator down I probably would have marked it as a wrong answer, but now that you're saying to me that they used it is used to hold water, it is a very good
        - it's a very good thought
        - Yeah, they definitely use those
        - It's not wrong at STUDENT
        - So that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses
        - It had STUDENT the great all the good pieces in it,
        - Your answer wasn't wrong
        - Um, let's see, I so your answer wasn't wrong
        - So STUDENT also that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, which is absolutely correct
        - So that's really good
        - So the lunar orbiter the microscope and you said some masks and other oxygen tanks and equipment like that
        - Okay, so you're absolutely right about craters their work craters on the moon, and there was some water in there,
        - And you're right to say that the scientists need a tool, called the microscope to look really closely
        - That is a tool that astronauts use on the moon you're right
        - That was amazing
        - Well, I love this response that you have right now
        - No, I'm not saying your answers wrong
        - No, I was just wondering like what, if you remember the name, because that is correct that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon
        - Honestly, like you, STUDENT of you are right,
        - And that is, that is a very true point um and I think this answer was a really good answer I just know
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - So this is a two part question
        - Great job remembering that they found the water on the moon
        - I think sometimes they can use improvement
        - But STUDENT, I do want to point out that your response
        - So I think your answers - none of your answers are wrong
        - I don't necessarily - you're not STUDENT necessarily here because your answers were wrong or bad
        - So like I said earlier, none of your answers are wrong
        - There's - so as long as you're using evidence to support your answer, there is really there isn't technically a wrong answer
        - One second, STUDENT
        - The Lunar Orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used, so that the both of those answers, would be correct
        - But the Lunar Orbiter
        - It's not one is right and one is wrong
        - No, you weren't wrong I just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the, you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely
        - mm hmm no you're not STUDENT you're not I want I want you to understand that you're not wrong
        - And they do mention in the reading and then the story about
        - The different thing that they that they need, so they need
        - They have the oxygen tanks, because they need to be able to breathe
        - When I read your answer that like I want, I want to reinforce and I want you to know that your answer is correct you're you're you're not sitting at the table, because your answer is wrong, none of you are
        - So they had to use the microscope to find it
        - So you can think of a way that they use oxygen tanks to find water, they might need oxygen tanks to be on the moon
        - Your answer isn't wrong
        - I just wanted STUDENT to be on the same page
        - I like there
        - There was nothing wrong with your answer
        - I like both of your answers
        - That is a very good answer
        - Thank you for sharing
        - And, you know, that was a very good answer
        - So, you are correct
        - And that's a very good way to do it
        - mm hmm yeah so you are completely correct NASA did send a small machine and that was used to discover water on the moon
        - So STUDENT was both they're both correct because it used to discover the water it doesn't have to do with
        - So you both have very different responses, but they're both correct, so they didn't use a microscope and that was your answer so that would make yours correct
        - STUDENT you have a very, very good response with a lot of detail in it
        - There's nothing wrong with any of your responses at STUDENT
        - STUDENT, first off, I really loved your response because you showed that you really, like, you read the reading, and you kind of took that in,
        - That was really wonderful
        - I really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on Earth
        - It says your- the microscope is right it is very much right,
        - They did find craters full of water
        - You're right, but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water
        - Maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without STUDENT, you have something to add
        - What we never said you STUDENT answers were wrong
        - And that's what the question was asking was asking which tools, specifically did they use to find this water, and I believe it did talk about a microscope in our reading right STUDENT read the reading?
        - You're definitely right as a microscope is a scientific tool
        - That's a great answer, because you're right
        - They did NASA did send a small machine
        - Okay, it's not necessarily wrong at STUDENT
        - And you weren't wrong
        - That was a machine that a piece of equipment that NASA uses that the astronaut uses
        - You're not wrong and I didn't even think of it that way
        - So I'm glad you brought this point up
        - This isn't necessarily every single person who ever had to sit down with the teacher again sometime's your answers not wrong
        - Absolutely completely right
        - So I think that you're right
        - STUDENT NASA does use a lot of different tools when it's exploring space
        - You answered part of the question you found the equipment that they used right that
        - And your answer is wonderful
        - So STUDENT after I read your answer
        - so severe that your answer isn't exactly wrong sometimes we just need help explaining
        - So your answer is correct, and you did a great job with your thinking
        - Your answer at the top is correct, you did find the equipment
        - STUDENT you did an amazing job with that sentence starter
        - Um, so your answer to your answer is correct, right
        - Thank you both for adding those strong answers from the text
        - Yes, the scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - That is the result
        - Yes, I agree with you
        - Yeah, so I think a lot is a good guessing
        - Um, yes microscope is a kind of a scientist tool
        - Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for STUDENT the passage when you answer the question
        - Teacher : Okay, so you said NASA and the small machine which is absolutely right
        - With your answer is not completely wrong
        - It's more than it's just missing a little bit of information
        - Yeah, I love that you mentioned the microscope, because that was definitely necessary
        - That's another tool that they used in order to find water and the moon
        - STUDENT, because you're right to look at something really closely, you would need a microscope
        - Um, that's really interesting
        - But let's think
        - If there are astronauts on the moon
        - You're so right
        - There needs to be oxygen tags
        - I would say that your answer wasn't wrong at STUDENT
        - Yes, scientists that work with NASA need a lot of equipment to be able to be able to safely do their
        - If they're leaving our earth
        - Expeditions they need oxygen like STUDENT said they need the proper space equipment
        - That's a great point
        - These are STUDENT pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations
        - I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong
        - Thank you for sharing and today is so important because No one's answer is wrong
        - And it's not your answer isn't wrong,
        - So you're absolutely right
        - Yeah, you're absolutely right here and thank you for making that connection and sharing those ideas with us
        - It's not wrong, STUDENT
        - Your answer isn't really wrong
        - Yes, can you tell me like what executive answer
        - And you're right
        - Your answer is not wrong at STUDENT
        - So even they are not the exact answer, they help us to view the main answer
        - Okay, so there is no wrong answer on here
        - Is not wrong STUDENT
        - That's a very great response and great observation, based on the text
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - That's not, that's not why you're in this STUDENT
        - I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about that machine
        - It's definitely your that's correct, that it was a small machine that they sent To find the ice deposits or just trying to look A little bit deeper into What the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon
        - That's actually a good answer, because it talks about the water they found on the, on the, on the moon was microscopic
        - Those are STUDENT part of the process of going up to the moon and using the Lunar Orbiter to find the end the microphone and a microscope To find the small amounts of water in the crater
        - We didn't necessarily talk about in this text
        - Or in this section of the text
        - So that's actually, I'm glad you said that because that's part of the process
        - So thank you for adding that
        - But that is exactly something that's a big part of it as well
        - Great, so that's that's a good answer
        - Full of water on the moon good observation
        - Yes, I remember that from the text as well
        - Remembering yes it does say that
        - So that's a great piece of information that we can actually STUDENT use To help answer the question, even better,
        - Oh, well, what makes you think your answers wrong
        - And you know what's been I was wrong i'm sorry about that I just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the microscope was part of the equipment, so you are also right, so thank you for that as well
        - They both have the right answer they're both
        - um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the Lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just STUDENT the equipment they used
        - But OK so STUDENT let's think about I like that you said microscope that was part of the equipment they use
        - I mean technically those would STUDENT be part of the like the equipment that the scientists use for this discovery of water let's think
        - Oh okay so um you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon well, so your answer was true it wasn't wrong
        - but technically, your answer was right they did find -oh i'm sorry they
        - So you said NASA centers small machine
        - You can look your answers are there you are correct  they had water
        - And STUDENT that's totally right the scientists do use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon
        - yeah you're right if scientists on the moon don't have oxygen tanks that's not any good ISM
        - yeah they That is exactly what the story said, and that was a really good observation
        - STUDENT your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that NASA a small machine
        - Awesome STUDENT Thank you so much so, you said that NASA sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for
        - You know STUDENT when I read your answer, I actually thought that your answer completed the question correctly
        - I think that what you said, made perfect sense that the Lunar orbiter is what equipment with us to discover water on the moon,
        - right so that's where we're focusing on those tools in particular
        - cool yeah because in this question we're really trying to address how they discovered the water on the moon
        - it's a great answer scientists absolutely use microscopes STUDENT the time to look at really small things like, for example, water so that's a great idea that both of you had
        - Well, your answers aren't wrong,
        - that's a great answer um
        - they're both right, you need both things
        - you're not in this STUDENT, because your answers are necessarily wrong right
        - Oh okay yeah so you're right you're so right about the craters there's definitely some craters
        - Oh okay i'm happy to help you out there, so you are right in that you are definitely have to really get really small to figure out that this water because, like we were saying earlier there's not a whole lot of water on the moon
        - Perfect Yes, you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the Lunar orbiter might do that as well, so we're going to take some different places, and I think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah, STUDENT what do you think
        - microscope Okay, so I do lot love the Oliveron and Farrah you STUDENT are making the connections with microscope because Yes, you are correct because, in order to look at it closely, you need it, you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead Oliveron
        - Did everybody see that's the whole question okay so STUDENT if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100% right because you circled information in your brain
        - Oh i'm not sure that your answer is wrong,
        - that's that's exactly right STUDENT The one thing that that you said that I want to clarify, as you mentioned
        - Your answer is not wrong scientists used lots of different machines to discover the water on the moon
        - yeah I yeah that's very true and the microscope is another piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - yeah so I see yeah that's perfect evidence in the text to support your statement that water can be valuable
        - yeah, so we need them both
        - I don't think your answer is wrong so much as it might be the way I was thinking about so here, so I actually just bought my own STUDENT
        - STUDENT, when you said in your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, I think you're totally right they did and that's so exciting right
        - Right right Do you remember okay I love that you're talking about the water because that's ultimately what we're trying to get to right Do you remember
        - STUDENT no one ever said, your answer was wrong and your answer, I would say right now, your answer is not wrong
        - So you're right in that they did use they did use a microscope
        - So your answer is not wrong STUDENT
        - yeah so STUDENT you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and Jazmin's answer about the Lunar orbiter was correct
        - that's really great point
        - awesome great love that detail that you're using
        - it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine
        - And that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - awesome, thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah STUDENT go for it
        - With what the text was about because it's true that scientists did find craters full of water on the moon
        - hmm STUDENT I love your thinking because you're totally right that the article  talk about using a microscope to look at the water
        - Thinking about discovery so you're right that they were using the microscope to look at the water they found
        - yeah right they do use a lot of equipment, I think my suggestion for you here because you're right that's that signed us and asked us a ton of different kinds of equipment
        - You are correct in that they found is using a small machine
        - I didn't know that there was water on the moon before I read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well
        - What does STUDENT else-
        - That's a really good way of thinking about it
        - Okay, I wouldn't say that your answer is wrong, I actually I don't think anybody's answers are right or wrong, I think that you you STUDENT circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space
        - Well, your answer is not wrong you're actually really correct NASA did send a small machine
        - That is a very good question so Jazmin's answer was correct, but your answer is also correct because this question has multiple answers to it
        - Oh, I don't think that that's wrong, I think that you bring up a really good point because you found information in a different paragraph
        - And then we've got what STUDENT said, which was the microscope so these might be different pieces of equipment or tools that scientists are using to find water on the moon
        - yeah, so I think, based on what STUDENT has shared we realize the scientists need lots of different tools to do their work right
        - Okay, so you're actually on the right track um I would not, I wouldn't say your answer is wrong
        - And it's true that this NASA scientists will use a lot of tools to
        - Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong
        - Very good, yes, scientists do use a lot of equipment so again, this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use So if you feel that STUDENT of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer
        - Now, these are STUDENT true right because you all circled things that were right from the text right
        - Right and we know that a machine is the type of equipment okay
        - your answers not wrong it's just there's multiple parts to it,
        - They did and so those craters
        - so they were both right both of your both of your answers
        - Yes, yep you are
        - Right, those are good, those are good points, both both of you STUDENT
        - Remembering that any answer can be made better but it's not that you have a wrong answer that maybe it's just answering a different question right so let's try and strengthen our answers here,
        - Jazmin and STUDENT you both came up with great answers for why water
        - With your response you had mentioned that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated that seems really helpful you can't survive without water that's definitely true right
        - and you might have also noticed that in paragraph five, it starts with moon water could be useful so you're not wrong that saying
- intent: r230.1
  examples: |
        - i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer
        - STUDENT why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said
        - All right, STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine
        - would be, can you tell me more about this small machine does
        - STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did
        - Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is STUDENT, can you tell me why you put that answer as well
        - yeah so Chris you're right Those are STUDENT great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer
        - All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers STUDENT, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer
        - Farrah and STUDENT you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer
        - say more, why is it the answer to the question STUDENT
        - STUDENT was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different
        - And does STUDENT know
        - Can someone tell me what discover means?
        - That is absolutely correct
        - We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words
        - And what are those two different things
        - What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson
        - And then we'll talk about the answer
        - Why are you confused
        - So did you say you have a new answer
        - STUDENT and were you a person who said no
        - Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind
        - Why would a microscope, help us see the water
        - Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small
        - Can you tell me more?
        - Aside from the question itself
        - Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting
        - Is that what you said
        - You didn't find that in the reading
        - Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?
        - Hey, STUDENT can you tell me a little bit more why you like Farrahs answer
        - I like the connection you made there
        - Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?
        - Thank you so much for reading
        - So, STUDENT, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?
        - Why did you write down the answer that you did
        - OK, and Oliver why did you, why did you put down the same thing in STUDENT was your mind going the same way as hers?
        - I saw where STUDENT
        - What made you change your answer
        - Where you revised your answer
        - what made you change your mind
        - What made you change your answer?
        - Okay, STUDENT and you revised you're in
        - Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that
        - So you put that the water
        - What made you change to change your answer
        - What did you change your answer to
        - You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice
        - Can you list off some equipment that they used
        - So I'd like to start with STUDENT
        - What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there
        - So let's hear your answer
        - And how do you think you got to that answer
        - You could give me one moment, STUDENT, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on
        - STUDENT, absolutely you can
        - What were you looking for?
        - Well, let's look at what made you think of that
        - And what led you that answer
        - And how did you gather that information
        - Did you read our passage
        - And STUDENT then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah
        - Will you tell me where you found your answer
        - What do you think
        - STUDENT What are you thinking
        - Okay, so let's talk about that
        - STUDENT, did, why did you answer your question by using, by saying the words
        - What made you say that
        - Okay, so you your answer, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely, so I can
        - Okay, what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Okay, what do you mean by that
        - Why do you think a scientist would need a microscope to see the water
        - Why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water
        - She said a microscope is used to see things that are really small
        - Yes, that is what they sent
        - And STUDENT, what did they investigate when they got there?
        - What would that be valuable
        - So why did you STUDENT think that what was your opinion about that
        - Like, how did you come up with your answer
        - Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the STUDENT
        - I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and STUDENT try and explain why you picked microscope?
        - Well, STUDENT if you already know a lot about space
        - Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did
        - So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable
        - But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and STUDENT on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence
        - Did you understand
        - You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Did you understand you answer?
        - Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - What did you understand
        - You understand that answer?
        - Can you share with your, your students STUDENT
        - Yeah, how did you come up with that answer
        - Can you tell me a little bit more about that
        - Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine
        - And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?
        - So that's one thing that they used
        - What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that STUDENT?
        - How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - And why is that a big deal
        - Okay so STUDENT, they do use microscopes right?
        - And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?
        - Do you know if it had
        - A more specific name
        - Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name
        - What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure
        - So how can that make it valuable
        - and STUDENT Can you tell me a little bit about your answer
        - You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment
        - So you talked about
        - Why did you, why did you look for
        - Why did you say that they use small machines
        - So you specified that they use small machines
        - So why did you say they use microscopes
        - Why did you say not for a long time
        - You said no because not not for a long time
        - So, STUDENT, the water can be
        - You said that water can be split into two parts
        - Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts
        - Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question
        - What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water
        - So that would be good
        - STUDENT, you talk to me about water being heavy
        - Why did you choose to talk to me about that
        - Why did you say they're not ready yet
        - They you said they're not ready yet
        - Okay, so it lands where?
        - So, STUDENT, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome
        - Can you tell me what that means
        - Okay, so it is an equipment
        - What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?
        - How did you get to that answer
        - So when you are listening and answering this question
        - Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope
        - Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer
        - What made that microscope stick out to you
        - And what made you think about the craters on the moon
        - Wow, what were you using it to find?
        - So let's talk about that just a little bit
        - So what made you choose that as your answer
        - Will you tell me what what
        - your thought process was for answering that
        - What made you choose that word
        - What made you choose the word microscope
        - Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else
        - I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger
        - So that is true
        - It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that
        - You kind of both have very similar responses
        - It's not ready yet
        - So Luis Oh no, sorry, STUDENT, you talk, you said no
        - So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's
        - So what do you mean by that
        - You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time
        - Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time
        - How come you do that
        - So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as STUDENT
        - So did you find that on your own prior to STUDENT writing that or did you kind of just copy that?
        - It says, NASA send a small machine
        - What was the name of that small machine
        - And then if you look at Jazmin's answer
        - Or how did you come to that conclusion
        - Can you explain what you mean by that
        - Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as STUDENT
        - Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion
        - Why do you think that
        - But if they could get to it
        - What do you think
        - And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it
        - And why do you think that
        - STUDENT, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated
        - Why is that true?
        - Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right
        - Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?
        - Say that we do have enough money
        - And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?
        - So, STUDENT, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water
        - You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Why would they need to use a microscope
        - So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used
        - What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence
        - And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence
        - Okay, why did you circle equipment
        - And why did you circle discover
        - So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon
        - How did you know that water's heavy
        - What is it you know about space
        - STUDENT But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon
        - Now I did notice Farrah and STUDENT had the same response
        - Okay, so that sounds good
        - So let's go back and look at our responses here
        - So which one of you would like to explain your response
        - So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this STUDENT, though
        - Okay, so I STUDENT so you think are you know a lot about space
        - Okay, so what's confusing you STUDENT
        - Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine
        - What is it called
        - Okay, so what is, what is that thing
        - What do you know about microscopes
        - How is it used on the moon
        - Well, does it pertain to our article?
        - and how do you know this
        - Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter
        - So when you say the small machine
        - Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?
        - Do you know that phrase
        - And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before
        - Do you know what a microscope is
        - Why do you think equipment is the most important word
        - Why do you think water is the most important question or word
        - And what do you have figured out
        - What are you confused about
        - Why do you think it is a valuable resource STUDENT
        - That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean
        - If we can refill up on the moon
        - What do you think that would mean
        - Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read?
        - Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title
        - STUDENT, what made you come up with your answer choice
        - How did you come up with that answer
        - STUDENT, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon
        - Why did you underline discover
        - So I saw responses and STUDENT
        - My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is STUDENT
        - So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me
        - What do you say that
        - In what way
        - Um, STUDENT, how did you come up with your answer
        - So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT, what do you have to say about your answer
        - What are you thinking
        - Okay, I'm going to start with STUDENT Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah
        - So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks
        - You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon
        - Let's look at yours
        - Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer
        - So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer
        - Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - What do you believe it means
        - So what made you choose those two words
        - They need a small machine
        - Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine
        - And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read
        - Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question
        - Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen
        - And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer
        - Why does that make water valuable
        - and why does that make it valuable
        - What's your thinking there
        - Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?
        - Do you remember what that machine was
        - What is the microscope D
        - Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon
        - What were those two parts that you said
        - Okay, so, um, Miss STUDENT, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - What do you know about a microscope
        - Does anybody, STUDENT have the specific name of the machine?
        - Okay, so yes, they used a small machine
        - You want to explain that?
        - Not for a long time, why do you think not, for a long time
        - Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident
        - So where are you confused STUDENT
        - That was really good
        - However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?
        - That -you did discover that they use oxygen tanks
        - That was a great answer so Oliver you circle, the same as STUDENT what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used
        - What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon
        - Now STUDENT your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used
        - i'm so STUDENT your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz
        - STUDENT, why did you circle
        - The same thing that STUDENT didn't
        - What was your reason
        - and, why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - and also how was your answer answering the question
        - yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Can you explain what that means
        - Why did you circle the last sentence?
        - Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that
        - You could say, can you explain what you mean
        - Teacher:but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer
        - yeah what are you confused about telling me
        - What won't be ready
        - And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Can I just ask you what made you say that
        - So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that
        - Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question
        - Can I ask you why, if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer
        - Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？
        - Did you work with Savannh on this question?
        - Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that
        - Did you work with STUDENT on the question
        - Can you elaborate on that response
        - You're using each other to help one another
        - Do you need me to to re explain it
        - What did you fully understand this question
        - I mean, you were all working in a small STUDENT which is great
        - But why did you circle, the same thing as STUDENT
        - Why did you think it is a right answer?
        - I see that you said that you
        - Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said
        - and Oliver so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as STUDENT?
        - Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools
        - So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?
        - What is, what does that mean to you, why did you highlight that answer
        - So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Can you explain a little bit more
        - Why you circle that
        - All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer STUDENT could you tell me what the answer was
        - For a couple of you guys so deb could you go more in depth with your answer, I know you did circle, the same as STUDENT, but I want to know why you did, or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah
        - awesome So what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly
        - Okay i'm STUDENT Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking
        - STUDENT do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house
        - I just was wondering, so you said no, not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well, I don't
        - Okay, what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah
        - So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So let's actually go to you now, STUDENT
        - What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?
        - STUDENT, I see that you were talking about a small machine
        - Is that the machine you were talking about?
        - I want to know a lot more of what you know about it
        - So tell me about the machine
        - I would just like to hear a little bit more detail
        - It's not wrong at STUDENT
        - That's really cool, I love that
        - Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at STUDENT when you were at NASA?
        - The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the
        - Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer
        - Good and how did you come to that conclusion
        - Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that
        - Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to STUDENT, can you tell me
        - Why it's not ready
        - So what makes you think
        - What did you, why did you circle those things?
        - You wrote the same thing
        - What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it
        - So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that
        - So you and STUDENT kind of have similar responses
        - Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life
        - What makes you think you got STUDENT figured out
        - So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text
        - What made you say that
        - What are you confused about
        - So, in your answer, why did you choose that
        - it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking
        - Really, so do you think they could use the Lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah
        - So let's STUDENT, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon
        - Why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - How did you get to that answer?
        - So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - We're going to start with you
        - So Oliver, I see that you just answered the same as STUDENT
        - Did you read the article
        - Does it say what the name of the small machine is
        - Can you elaborate on that
        - I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head
        - Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more
        - And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts
        - Either you can explain why did you circle that
        - So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it
        - Think in your brain
        - What made you answer that
        - But while I do that I was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer
        - When you read the question what relied talk me through it
        - Well, first, STUDENT, before I became um what made you think that was the correct answer
        - So I was wondering, what can you talk me through your answer
        - Okay, it's STUDENT
        - Can you talk me through your answer really quick
        - Why do you think that
        - Do you know what this machine is called
        - How did you STUDENT arrive that you're thinking
        - I'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer
        - STUDENT I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut
        - What do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable
        - Um, can you tell me more about this
        - Can STUDENT tell me how it feels, answering these opinion questions
        - And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?
        - Why did you circle equipment
        - Why did you say equipment
        - Discover okay why discover?
        - Do you have a name for the small machine
        - Um, I know that does sound funny
        - So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope
        - But do you know why that is
        - Yeah, STUDENT Jazmin's answer was right
        - Let me ask STUDENT
        - Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer
        - And what made you say that
        - So first, tell me what made you say that NASA sent a small machine
        - What made you choose this answer
        - So what made you
        - So, why, why do you think the microscope is the correct answer
        - So you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this
        - How big do you think the craters were?
        - STUDENT when you've said that you found craters full of water
        - So what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for
        - So they used it to investigate
        - what makes you think that it's small
        - Did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon
        - So you said that they had sent a small machine
        - Can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, let's take a look at your answer
        - What do you mean, what are they looking closely at
        - So you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and STUDENT
        - What else was that article about water
        - Great STUDENT, can you build to your answer
        - Can you add any other details
        - What else was the article about STUDENT
        - But I want you to think about what made your mind think that
        - What made your mind, find that answer
        - I'm happy that you work with STUDENT
        - So thank you for sharing
        - Did you get any answer independently
        - And everyone's going to have an assigned partner to work with in with your partner
        - I want you to share your answer and explain why you had that answer for two minutes and then I want our partners to switch in the person who did not share will then share
        - And explain to your partner
        - Why you found that answer
        - Why is that your answer?
        - And why not
        - And what did you did you work with your partner just now
        - What are you
        - Why does that make it valuable
        - Okay, why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true, that it can be broken down into two parts
        - But if we read on, and we get the complete idea if we finish the, the thought in the text and we keep reading
        - We may learn why that's important
        - And why do you think that's an important part of the question
        - Why do you think valuable, tell me more, please
        - So why is that valuable
        - Why is that important
        - Oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out
        - hmm that's so what, why is that such an important thing
        - Is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece
        - what did you mean by that
        - And STUDENT did your background knowledge help you, with your answer to the question I see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that did you think about that from your background knowledge
        - STUDENT and I just sorry or Sir, could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me
        - How can you come up with this answer?
        - yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you
        - Discover, why did you pick the term discover
        - I want to, to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time
        - What made you say that
        - What made you say that it's not ready yet?
        - Does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it
        - when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it
        - Do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile
        - What made you say that as your answer what stuff
        - I actually have a follow up question for you
        - What really stood out to you
        - Why did you say that
        - Um, what made you
        - What made you say that?
        - Okay um so STUDENT can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer
        - um so STUDENT i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer
        - Can you tell me um, what do you have figured out, can you explain that to me?
        - Can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine
        - Okay yeah that's STUDENT right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement, for me, certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon, but could you just clarify why you provided that response
        - Okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it, you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay
        - Okay did the scientists found the moon, I mean water in the moon?
        - so um STUDENT you were talking about the parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen, why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable?
        - I would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways, could we use water, why is it valuable
        - yeah, and so I also want to circle back to STUDENT because Jazmin I think that you circled right away that NASA sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water
        - yeah right and but seeing STUDENT, you said you know so much about space, I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you, right after Luis okay
        - Okay, so that was evidence you got from your own experience
        - So STUDENT where were you getting that idea from because i'm
        - Okay, so we're still thinking about that microscope right? What makes you think that they want to use a microscope?
        - yeah and why did, why did NASA astronauts need STUDENT those things
        - What do they look like?
        - yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits
        - So um what makes you think that your answers wrong
        - Tell me more, why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon
        - Could you describe more this machine that they use
        - STUDENT Can you explain to me how you came to your answer
        - And Chris, do you want to, in the meantime, while Farrah and STUDENT reread the text, do you want to Talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon?
        - Perfect So what have you figured out
        - So what is confusing to you about that
        - And I know you know, and I just need you to help me to understand
        - Oh yeah that's interesting, how do you think you could work that into your answer
        - What background knowledge do you want to add to your answer? Did you read your answer?
        - Well, can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article?
        - Could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon, and why they're looking for water on the moon?
        - Why wouldn't it make sense?
        - Okay, what are you confused about?
        - Okay, and Oliver you had something, you have a similar idea as STUDENT so, can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion
        - STUDENT do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people
        - Could you explain to the STUDENT, one of you, why you think that is what it was called?
        - I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and STUDENT raise their hand for the lunar orbiter
        - Farrah, can you tell me do you want to read out your answer, maybe we can all decide as a STUDENT, we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so Can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that
        - I read that you have the same answer STUDENT What was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason
        - Okay amazing our event, so you don't you know a lot about science and space so Can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did, and what do you think of your peers on so so far
        - For me, loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer
        - awesome great great great so um is STUDENT said, is that the reason why you chose the same answer
        - I really so good good STUDENT right now so have you heard about this story before, or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah
        - But sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so Luis if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question, can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain, because you knew STUDENT about space
        - Maybe, starting with STUDENT Luis could you explain how you came to your answer choice
        - whoa Okay, why are they definitely using oxygen tanks
        - Was that a question or a statement?
        - i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you STUDENT had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice
        - STUDENT, can you tell me a little bit more What do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now
        - STUDENT i'm seeing your head shaking no to, why do you think no
        - looks like STUDENT saying no, it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos
        - What can you tell me about your answer
        - Um STUDENT why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - why, why did you say that?
        - So what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading?
        - yeah tell me why you why you said that
        - So so let's start with your response STUDENT, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, I wonder what made you see that
        - I think your answer is very close to what we're looking for, but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope
        - So i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said, even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you STUDENT I think you had a very interesting thought, but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question
        - so STUDENT um tell me a little bit more about your response, what makes you think that the water, the creators are full of water
        - Why did you do that
        - that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen so I want to understand how this is going to be valuable
        - Thank you so much for staying um STUDENT I read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that
        - Would you like to share more about your conclusion
        - Can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to
        - Oh, the cost part
        - STUDENT, why do you think that's the right answer
        - Can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists?
        - I feel you have a great evidence, can you tell me more about this machine?
        - STUDENT, can you explain a little bit more about that for me
        - Well let's talk about Farrah's and Oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes
        - mm hmm that's right and STUDENT you are, you are thinking, the same thing right
        - and do you think STUDENT, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking
        - do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh
        - Okay well well, what did you figure out a bit curious to hear
        - I just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question can you explain your thinking a little bit
        - Tell me a little bit more about that
        - Okay, what are you confused about STUDENT
        - What did you find important about the small machine
        - But when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there
        - Okay, why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this STUDENT, because you don't know you already know about space
        - cool, How did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water
        - Okay STUDENT Can you help me what is your confusion, is it the question?
        - It does need to be a thing, and what made you say that
        - And what made you pick this particular sentence STUDENT
        - Can you tell me why you're confused
        - that's awesome STUDENT, can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope
        - Okay um So could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the Lunar orbiter
        - And how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon
        - What was your what
        - Alright, everyone thanks for sharing your responses with the STUDENT i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers, and I have a question to you, why do you think we each have different answers
        - Okay, so it sounds like, where did you learn that fact
        - Oh, and why do they need the oxygen tank
        - Okay, so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter, but I also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter, could you please tell me how you come up with that answer
        - when you read that question did you circle key words or underline things What was your strategy there
        - Oh exactly STUDENT so what made you think that the Lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two
        - yeah what what are you confused about, can you tell me, can you tell me
        - how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found
        - STUDENT What about for number two, how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment
        - What what makes you think that
        - Can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer
        - awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine
        - that's your revised answer
        - yeah so you you clarified response, which is, which is great what helped you find the title of
        - So, how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question
        - What do you mean STUDENT figured out
        - On the directions, or something else
        - which part, are you confused about
        - On what you meant by that
        - STUDENT right, thank you so i'm curious, so why did you decide to circle equipment?
        - Oh great so STUDENT do you want to tell me why you decided to circle equipment
        - yeah so thank you for sharing that STUDENT so let's take a look at discover, so why did you circle discover
        - Alright, so NASA sent a small machine so, can you tell me why did you say that
        - STUDENT right, well, why do you think that's Farrah's right?
        - yeah you're right they use tons of equipment, like the ones that you mentioned, and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon, can I ask you what makes you say that
        - Okay, and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks
        - Exactly and where have you seen that information before
        - Okay sounds good alright so right now I am going to give each of you individually 30 seconds to read over your response and think about what made you write that response
        - Alright, so our question is, why did you choose to write that response so starting now i'm going to give you about 30 seconds to think about that
        - Great and what made you write that answer, can you tell me a little bit little bit about that
        - run, one by one i'm going to ask each of you a question, which is what made you say that
        - All right, STUDENT actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that
        - Okay perfect Thank you alright STUDENT let's go on to you, so you said that NASA sent a small machine So why did you choose to write about small machine, can you tell me a little bit about that
        - Okay, great Thank you so they've been Farrah what made you STUDENT really focus on the microscope
        - Can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response, either one of you STUDENT can share yeah
        - yeah, so why do you think that scientists at NASA might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon
        - Still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now STUDENT
        - yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit, why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet
        - To look really closely is connected to discovering water
        - and I want to go to, why do you think the craters are full of water on the moon
        - STUDENT I think your answer is quite interesting, can you explain a little bit?
        - a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what
        - Why do you say that
        - Okay, what do you think about that, why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the STUDENT
        - So, can you tell me a little bit more about your response
        - So why did you choose that
        - yeah STUDENT had the small machines Jazmin is that, where you were referring to
        - Right Okay, so how did you find that out because I didn't see that in the text, so how to use that
        - Okay, and can you tell me a little bit more why you
        - And so maybe your answer has one of these two parts, but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you STUDENT and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks That was really smart edition
        - STUDENT, why did you say that this this does answer the question
        - Is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation
        - Can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that
- intent: r420.2
  examples: |
        - Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer
        - Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific STUDENT because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine
        - Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific
        - you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does
        - But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read
        - So take a second and write a new answer yes, STUDENT
        - Yes, Oliver, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as STUDENT, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her
        - So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail
        - But they, It was a small machine
        - Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer
        - We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence
        - To discover the water
        - So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer
        - So I know where your answer came from
        - Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as STUDENT, but if you could find that in the text and circle it
        - That would be awesome
        - I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me
        - Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine
        - Did you find that in the text?
        - They called it a microscope
        - That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now
        - Looking into and finding it for the first time
        - Can you look for that for me
        - Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question
        - You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth
        - So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher
        - You want to make sure I'm in for sure
        - Then I'm kind of in the dark
        - So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer
        - I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there
        - But it may be a smaller amount
        - Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon
        - I think we can be a little more specific in your response
        - Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there
        - So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely
        - Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends
        - And we're very specific when we're writing
        - That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are
        - A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way
        - And I think we can kind of change how that sets up
        - So you could say, NASA
        - I think would convey your meeting
        - Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically
        - Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those
        - So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring
        - So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine
        - Well, that'd be a good strategy
        - So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more
        - However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like STUDENT learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right
        - And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text STUDENT
        - Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer
        - But when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need
        - How would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable, or could be valuable on the moon
        - So I think you would have your sentence was great
        - Perhaps you could have worded it by saying, water is valuable, or could be a valuable
        - Yes, so we had to be very specific with our answer because they use the specific name in our text
        - I'm STUDENT, you wrote that NASA send a small machine
        - That's very good
        - So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called
        - Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text
        - So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with STUDENT
        - Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this
        - And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence
        - Does that make sense
        - Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen
        - Now let's go a little bit further with that answer
        - Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope
        - So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it
        - But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does
        - So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable
        - But we want to say give like an a yes or no question
        - If you think that it is valuable and STUDENT of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving
        - They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart
        - Maybe, but you can also use the passage
        - Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable
        - Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more
        - He said it could be useful because it can be broken down
        - Yeah, and that's what STUDENT said
        - And said what is valuable about breaking it down
        - That's the only thing I would have done
        - So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your
        - Thank you, them
        - Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words
        - Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read STUDENT of the information before we try to answer the question
        - What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you
        - Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine
        - So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer
        - You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total
        - So your answer is almost there
        - So NASA send a small machine
        - It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - You just need to add a little bit more information to it
        - So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay
        - But sometimes we have to look around too
        - Yeah, sometimes that works
        - Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article
        - So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation
        - So we have to describe that
        - But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?
        - So we have to name it
        - So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers
        - Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? STUDENT?
        - It could be a machine
        - It can be, words like machine or a tool
        - Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment
        - It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer
        - We need to restate that question in our answers
        - Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question
        - Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment
        - So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it
        - So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer
        - So we could say
        - It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it
        - The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter
        - And yeah STUDENT, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and
        - You did, and quite a few details
        - Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible
        - So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment
        - So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence
        - You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do
        - Does that make sense
        - You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right
        - Do you STUDENT understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers
        - So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have STUDENT the information that we need in our response
        - Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is
        - So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable
        - And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it
        - Does that help better explain it to you STUDENT
        - So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible
        - Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question
        - You got to make sure you add STUDENT of your details, does that help?
        - And when you answer your question
        - What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine
        - So you could be looking for something more specific
        - So when you're reading
        - So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - You could you should name that machine
        - And looking for a specific question
        - In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to
        - So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks
        - If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it
        - The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines
        - And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer
        - And it answers the question better
        - You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here
        - Like STUDENT, or a neighbor
        - STUDENT, I see you have a question
        - I want to hear what you found
        - So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it
        - Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend
        - Does that make sense
        - We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be
        - We can answer
        - Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers
        - And so the more detail
        - I mean, the more detail
        - but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day
        - Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question
        - And so maybe the substitute didn't have that
        - Does that make sense
        - Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends
        - Maybe if you working in partners of two
        - So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific
        - What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific
        - So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that's the only thing I would add to yours
        - Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question
        - That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading
        - So you could still say I agree with STUDENT, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her
        - What is it that she picked that I agree with
        - Does that make sense
        - Instead of just agreeing with STUDENT, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah
        - Go ahead and think about why you might agree with STUDENT
        - So if we rewrote our answers
        - If we might do that in a minute
        - And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response
        - but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was
        - Alright, so, STUDENT, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer
        - So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be
        - So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose
        - So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific
        - Perhaps the Lunar Orbiter
        - I think for us to build on your answer
        - We'd have a complete full answer to that question
        - I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer
        - So you have a good start
        - If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now
        - And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just
        - but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right
        - If we go back into the text
        - I but I think NASA
        - We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer
        - So looking in the text
        - Where could we are, what could we add
        - So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine
        - You said NASA send a small machine
        - And so your answer
        - And give more details what top of small machine was it
        - I just, I would like to build more upon your answer
        - So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we STUDENT agree that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - It's just what you think
        - But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read
        - Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion
        - Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true
        - So you don't want to have an opinion
        - So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer
        - Just be independent
        - Not what STUDENT found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water
        - And Oliver, I circled the same I STUDENT
        - Alright, so talk about what you found
        - And talk about yourself, not another student
        - I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer
        - That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question
        - What would be helpful
        - And what else, what identifies that machine
        - Yeah, tell me something about it
        - So probably the machines name as well
        - And just make sure your bringing it from the text
        - t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that
        - I love when students make the question
        - Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer
        - So what you'll do is
        - So for example, you are going to restate the question
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that
        - Would say there is convinced
        - There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Let me see you again, sorry
        - So there you restated the question you answered the question
        - Then you would say in the text, what it says
        - And then you would explain why that's important
        - Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - The only thing I would like is just the restate the question
        - You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it
        - Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon
        - Can you STUDENT and then you're off
        - And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you
        - Found the evidence from number six
        - That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain
        - So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question
        - Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought
        - I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good
        - See if you can find it
        - So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer
        - Okay so STUDENT talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second
        - Yeah, so you and STUDENT
        - STUDENT see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen
        - Um, I have not heard that
        - Did you have a question, your hand was up just a second ago
        - Okay, so you and Farrah and STUDENT Chris
        - But let's think about this text, though
        - But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - So STUDENT, you were on the right track
        - And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?
        - talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to
        - That question by using the two words that you STUDENT underlined as keywords
        - So STUDENT You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - How could you be more specific to the passage
        - So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions
        - So I want you STUDENT to look at the answer that you put for this question
        - I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot
        - You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name
        - Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer
        - So that's when you would want to refer back to the text
        - So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But yes, it's looking for something specific
        - That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask
        - Microscope and stuff like that
        - But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer
        - We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon
        - I want you to help each other
        - Understand the text
        - And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you STUDENT to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water
        - One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question
        - So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you STUDENT were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading
        - Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer
        - Because we must always refer to the text
        - The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel
        - That's why it's valuable
        - but that detail you just added is critical
        - So that's a great answer
        - That's why it's valuable
        - So that second Part that you just gave me
        - So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned
        - So we had to find evidence
        - So we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions
        - Um, well, the question asked, according to the text
        - So you might be right
        - From what you know from your dad going to NASA, we have to use the text in order to answer the question
        - Yeah, you want to look back in the story and make sure you're answering the whole question that stories like your friend
        - You want to keep looking back, and it has STUDENT your answers
        - And then STUDENT, I really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope, I would have loved
        - If you give us another example, or maybe added on to Mars, Venus thought I definitely did like your answer and how you
        - Understand, maybe next time
        - If you have the same idea someone, you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up
        - You could say that to like you can bring an example of
        - Why do you think they're using microscopes
        - Do you think it helped them to find the craters
        - Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text
        - Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process
        - I would have loved if you
        - Just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does
        - Just like how you said previously, and then kind of
        - So what you could do is saying, NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter
        - They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that
        - might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple, like NASA said the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Yeah, like we should fill in the blanks, just to make our sentence a little Meteor
        - Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text
        - Does that sound good?
        - You can always write that even scientists use a microscope
        - Is that better?
        - But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see
        - So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about
        - I just think that it sounds like you understand
        - So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff
        - But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate
        - So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks
        - Something specifically from the text
        - Does that make sense
        - yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called
        - Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that
        - But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you
        - So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text
        - However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to STUDENT where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water
        - And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that
        - pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon
        - I would probably just expand your response, so you could
        - Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering STUDENT parts of the question and as much detail as you can
        - Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me
        - you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon
        - I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start
        - I think that you could have, you could have maybe expanded on a little more on instead of saying like I scientists found craters for water on the moon, you could maybe as is answer, while also kind of expanding upon it by like adding like blah blah blah
        - I know it wasn't too long of a thing to read, so he couldn't really expand upon it as much
        - You know, I have you STUDENT heard about thinking outside the box
        - Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way
        - But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it
        - I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box
        - Your idea is not really working
        - So like when say like someone asked you to build a house right um and your ideas that you had before
        - So you're kind of running out of ideas and sometimes thinking outside the box like instead of doing it like this normal approach like the typical way of doing it
        - So the maybe expand on your point, which was a good point
        - The only thing I would say to add is maybe you could, because you said a lot of equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks
        - You could say, like, they also use like special helmets and like a special like space suit or something like helmet
        - a suggestion I have for you
        - To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help
        - on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on
        - Pretty key to STUDENT this um
        - so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like
        - A reason why, like the thing that they found to be important in La um I know that's a lot,
        - A suggestion I had written down when I looked at STUDENT the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say
        - NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them
        - So maybe like adding like a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence
        - But i'm just i'm hoping that you know that the challenge of having maybe a longer sentence or breaking it maybe breaking it into two
        - can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um
        - um okay um can you do, you tell me in your own words, why it's not ready, using using what's in the passage, but in your own words okay
        - I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse um so so STUDENT your answer was awesome like
        - um alright so STUDENT water, you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen great job on that um So could you kind of tell me why
        - Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen
        - um because, again, as I said, adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and
        - But I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used
        - There was us a little bit more details,
        - I wish they had a little bit more details like for Oliver and STUDENT
        - You STUDENT had some really good responses for a couple of them
        - but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response
        - So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it
        - Does that sound good
        - Yeah, like your personal views, along with what you found from the text
        - But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views sound good
        - So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading
        - So, STUDENT, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now
        - That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more
        - what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task What you said is good but it's a little
        - They use the equipment they use
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the machine
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use
        - But so far, so good
        - You realize that STUDENT had a good answer
        - And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer
        - So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it
        - Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on
        - So you see how she said microscope
        - They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water
        - You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text
        - Or if  you disagree or anything
        - So we're not STUDENT saying the same things
        - Just adding on to the discussion
        - My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response
        - My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something
        - So I see where you agreed with STUDENT
        - It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track
        - Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start
        - I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer
        - Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly
        - Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully
        - So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what you want to say in your
        - Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment
        - Yeah, you have to write more stuff
        - We want to be using that
        - Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water
        - Does that make sense
        - You have to add more words
        - You want to make sure that - it's STUDENT about being specific
        - You want to use good examples from the text
        - so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers
        - So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer
        - So going back to what STUDENT said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine
        - But what does it do? To answer the question in context
        - Right, so just that one little extra step
        - That makes sense
        - Could really just push through your answer
        - The second piece
        - So you had part of the what you just needed
        - Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why
        - It's just we need more specifics
        - You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read
        - So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics
        - You need to be able to
        - So, STUDENT when you're looking at these answers
        - So you got that you got you got the equipment
        - Look at the what they're asking for
        - Next time, just make sure if it has a name include the name
        - You need to have a little more details
        - But we need to be a little more detailed
        - yeah so my suggestion to you in the future is just to remember those key words because those key words like the Lunar orbiter that's an important thing to know for our vocabulary in the future in this lesson
        - So do you STUDENT see anything that could support your answers from the text
        - However, we need to think about our phrasing of the question
        - Um, so yeah, so we found our answer
        - Yes, that's really good
        - We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know
        - I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text
        - um so would STUDENT maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?
        - So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language STUDENT would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah
        - But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope
        - Like Orbiter, things like that
        - Does that make sense?
        - So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading
        - but I want you each to come up with your own individualized answers
        - Your thinking so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me I would start this sentence, but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence, I would say to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank
        - And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank
        - Now i'm sure you serve you did circle, the same as STUDENT Farrah his answer was the microscope, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers, yes, you and samantha might have had the same answers
        - What types of equipment use on the reading not not necessarily you and STUDENT I want to know exactly what depth saw in the reading so again, the example sentence might help you
        - Perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine that's perfect NASA did send a small machine, but I want you to add more I want you to build on that now, you went back and you highlighted the Lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one
        - Perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them okay
        - awesome you should put that in your answer to, then you know a lot about space okay wow
        - So we need to build your sentence, because we only have a little bit so, how would you start your sentence
        - You are correct, NASA sent a small machine
        - So to fix your answer just a little bit
        - And just a simple fix
        - We can put on it is at the words, called a microscope, at the end of it
        - That's STUDENT you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect
        - my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue
        - Otherwise your answer is perfect
        - Well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than, say you didn't listen to someone else
        - And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used
        - That's it to make your answer perfect
        - So in your next response, you could say a scientific tool use
        - So when next time when you're doing this, maybe explain what the microscope was used for
        - Was the microphone scope to look really closely at the water because that was what the question was asked, so three jobs
        - What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine
        - And maybe what the machine was called
        - Look really closely at things, which is true
        - But I asked him into then go on and say, how did the microscope
        - Microscopic so that's why STUDENT said that, and which is why spins and ended up being really great because she explained how the instrument was used to find the water
        - So does that make sense
        - Yes, so she took the instrument, she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water
        - The question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that was found
        - I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable
        - would carry the water, it would be too heavy but then your response should have something about why it not the water not being carried would be a good thing, so just elaborating a little bit off of that of how
        - Right, so that is what you would put into your answer, just to explain and relate back to the question that's being asked
        - but maybe we could elaborate and and why, why do they use this tool
        - What does this tool, help them with
        - Can you kind of elaborate on that response
        - Can you tell me why you need a microscope
        - So Referring to the water on the moon text
        - Chris and STUDENT, I'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use
        - So, that that is a correct answer a small machine I were just looking, I guess I'm just looking for more specific, so later in the sentence, they get a little bit more specific
        - I just have a question for you to think about
        - When you are giving a response after reading a text, it's always a good idea to include evidence
        - Thank you for sharing your responses on that reading
        - Does anyone know what ways they can include evidence? STUDENT?
        - So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote
        - So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts, the writer's thoughts
        - I don't want you to think about it as right and wrong, but we can always make our answers better, right? So the more details we add can make them better
        - So that's another thing we want to consider when we're thinking of our answers, is does this answer the question that's being asked? Because sometimes our answers are very true and relate to the story but are not related to the original question
        - And if you have more information to add, that's great
        - But we really want to focus on what we're reading
        - No? So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text
        - You can add that later
        - So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first
        - That way we can back up our answer with evidence from the story
        - We want to say both, right? We always want to use our own words and also include some of the author's words or thoughts
        - So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools to, maybe, think further on our answers
        - But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through STUDENT of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article
        - So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear
        - So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific
        - Maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used
        - Like the Lunar Orbiter that Jazmin was talking about or even the microscope that STUDENT was talking about
        - We activated that
        - And that you know that they use a lot of different tools
        - So even though, you do have your background knowledge
        - We just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question
        - Nope, your answer is correct, but to answer the actual question that we brought into it, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so that's how you would want to broaden your, your, your response
        - You could say, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that could be useful in your response
        - but we just need to beef it up a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary
        - You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using STUDENT your resources from the passage
        - And you agree with STUDENT, which is awesome but you kind of want to put it into your own words
        - I kind of wanted to talk to you about your answer
        - So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers
        - So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading
        - But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand
        - You don't have to write down STUDENT of them
        - You know what I'm saying
        - We can build on this sentence by saying, NASA sense and the machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in the craters
        - We want to have enough words to describe what we're thinking
        - So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got STUDENT that information from reading the passage
        - Exact put it in your own words or that you understand
        - But I'd like for you to explain why you chose that answer
        - And I think you did a great job of showing me that
        - So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA
        - So our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer
        - so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right now send
        - So, like, I told for STUDENT when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well okay
        - So let's do a sentence spring
        - So instead of saying, NASA sent a small machine, you could use our vocabulary word Lunar Orbiter
        - Can you repeat that with me, NASA sent a lunar orbiter
        - Oh, your answer was not wrong
        - I think that we can add more details to your answer to your answer
        - Well, your answer wasn't wrong you actually had a really good answer, but we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer,
        - yeah like you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those word to equipment that they used to discover water on the moon
        - So you could say one way that the that water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen says, what do you think, do you think that sounds better
        - A way that I could see you making a response, even better, is kind of adding the question into the response
        - Keep the first part of your answer, but only make that your first part and then
        - Go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct
        - I think it would be really hard to get it ready too
        - I think that's a really good point but let's think back to what I just said to STUDENT do you have any thoughts of how you could make your answer a little bit stronger
        - Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading
        - yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes STUDENT
        - Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more
        - So you had STUDENT of the right information
        - Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words I say something like, to discover water on the moon
        - It's the one thing
        - So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about
        - You need a specific scientific tool called Microsoft to look really closely
        - So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context
        - Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called
        - Do you remember
        - It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - That was something that was in our text water on the moon
        - And so adding small details like that can really strengthen our response
        - You added more words and you added specific details
        - So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of what was that
        - So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger
        - Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe i'm being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response
        - So I think yeah yeah, so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for STUDENT would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can
        - is needed for astronauts to breathe, and so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends, reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us, yes STUDENT
        - To restate the question exactly So if you restate the question you say something like
        - or is there a statement that you might think of or an answer to the question that you might have based with evidence from the reading?
        - That's true, yeah, maybe it is, but I think there's something to think about is that when we're doing these assignments, we want to make sure that we're using the reading to backup our thoughts and to use evidence from the reading
        - I think a next time
        - If there's something we could Oliverelop that a little bit more like talking, you can say, you know what kind of small machine did they use
        - Or different things like that
        - Just Oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already, then you already have
        - But there's nothing wrong with your answer
        - Instead of just saying, NASA used a small machine, you could say, NASA used the lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So you could say, NASA, so like it said in the reading, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers
        - I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at STUDENT of the tools that they referenced because
        - Yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use that there are other tools that they utilize as well, so I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting STUDENT of the points possible
        - But I feel as though, like with a few of your other parents your answer can use a little bit more umpf, they could have he could have a little bit more to it
        - yeah that's that's totally okay um so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that were being as clear as possible
        - It still has the same, it is the same, it does almost the same thing that your answer had that you wrote down but it just gives that a little bit more power to prove and to show that you are able to go back and reference, the text, while also understanding what you read
        - yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote
        - Not yeah more words but you want to make sure that you don't necessarily have it's not always more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference, the text in your reading
        - They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need
        - While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering
        - That you can add a little bit more that's kind of the whole point of all of you, being in this STUDENT today
        - your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more
        - information from the texts or like direct quotes or like add the names of the machines, instead of generalizing it yeah STUDENT
        - They found the craters by using the Lunar orbiter helped them find the craters on the moon you just needed to add that little extra bit at the end of it to make sure that you really got the answer
        - yeah using evidence from the text, you have to state whether or not it is a valuable resource
        - So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you and this suggestion is for everybody, not just STUDENT
        - Is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so
        - A suggestion I would say, is, I know this because, in paragraph four, it states
        - Your answer is not wrong at STUDENT
        - It's actually really great
        - I loved your answer, STUDENT
        - But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?
        - So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general
        - So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on
        - So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well
        - So like in the text, what small machine
        - Are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine
        - We want to be very specific
        - So when we answer
        - So that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was lunar orbiter which is a small machine
        - But we just want to make sure we're super specific about it
        - So, you are correct
        - So that's STUDENT you have to say
        - So when you're saying, just make sure you specify just be like, Well, I do know from previous information that they have to use oxygen tanks, because there's a very limited amount of oxygen in space
        - In the text we can go deeper into the text and find more answers, like the machines and tools and equipments to find that in your answer and get more evidence and details into that response, and that would be great
        - Just make sure that we're going deeper into the text, one more reading it, so we can find even more information, because that answer was pretty good, very good
        - But if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing
        - So I would look definitely more closely, like, I told savannas and you STUDENT circle, the same thing and find some more other tools or more evidence from the text that we can use and support your answer in the question
        - so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in
        - That makes sense? to add yeah I think you think I just have to add the Lunar orbiter to my answer yep and make sure you use evidence from the text to support that
        - scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states, so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is, is incorporated into your answer
        - So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two
        - And they didn't use a lunar orbiter which was similar to Jazmin's so STUDENT of you, in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response, so we can all say like in this paragraph, I found in your answer
        - But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response, you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text
        - You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text
        - STUDENT, your answer is not wrong
        - We just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know
        - So instead of saying small machine, we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter, so we want to try to be a little bit more specific
        - Instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter
        - All right, STUDENT, your response was really great
        - I know you have so many great thoughts
        - I love that you kind of collaborated off of Farrah's idea, but what I want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say
        - I want you to try to, when you're answering questions about text, I want you to try to look for specific things
        - And even if you share the same ideas as your classmate, try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking
        - For example, if STUDENT has the answer, then you can say the same answer, but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it
        - And I also love that you using your new knowledge of equipment and you're realizing you know where where you can get a little bit more specific with your answer and the equipment that they use
        - We can add some evidence into our answer
        - I want you to look back into the reading though we need to circle the evidence, where it talks about where you want to answer
        - You need to have specific evidence in the reading
        - It's a small machine and we want to get super specific when we're answering these questions from a nonfiction text
        - Like we're reading now
        - You want to be as specific as we can
        - So it's a real text with real facts
        - So would you want to add that to your answer
        - But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter
        - I love that
        - You got to remember it their equipment equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well
        - Does that make more sense of how you have to make sure that you're answering the full question when they say equipment
        - So what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question
        - It's small machine called
        - So STUDENT you have to do is add that to your answer to make it super specific and to somebody who didn't read this article
        - They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we STUDENT knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it
        - Yes, Deb, you have a hand up
        - So now we know to look, you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions
        - Yeah, just that was kind of from your prior knowledge
        - We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers
        - So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer
        - And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer
        - Does STUDENT want to talk about their response first
        - So there you go
        - STUDENT So we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts
        - Thank you for sharing
        - but we do want to add to your answer
        - What that water is used for for the astronauts
        - If you get stuck, and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help
        - Think about restating the question in your answer
        - I want you to expand your
        - What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion
        - The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and STUDENT for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text
        - But I want you to learn a little bit from Chris Jazmin and STUDENT about giving reasons why you think your, your answer
        - STUDENT Have you learned anything from
        - So I when I tell you to go back and finish up your work, please use that evidence to support your answer
        - And that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon
        - And I'm going to talk to you one on one
        - I wanted to show you something
        - But, well, I talked to one student
        - This is called a sentence starter
        - I don't know if you can see it, but I'm going to read it to you anyway
        - Do you notice sentence starters, my friends
        - Sometimes sentence starters help us deepen our thinking
        - So can I read the sentence starter to you, is that okay
        - And then there's a line blank
        - So this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon
        - So this sentence starter says the scientists used
        - And this is where you're going to put the number
        - There's a number at the side of the paragraphs and I want to know exactly where you found your answer
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - I found my answer in paragraph blank
        - Okay, just try your best
        - I want my friends, I want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer
        - That's STUDENT that matters
        - So, well, I start with STUDENT
        - Um, you can do it on your own
        - And then after you after you do that today
        - And I want you to start working on the sentence starter
        - Do you need me to read that to you
        - Because that's important for readers to see because if the reader doesn't read the text and then they read their answer
        - They want to know that your answer is right and that you're telling the truth
        - So if you could fill out this sentence starter for me
        - I'm glad I'm so glad
        - So your answer is right
        - But I think that if we add a little bit more detail and we describe is there may be an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use
        - That would be super helpful
        - So, STUDENT, if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name
        - Yeah, so if you were to restate your answer
        - Or you could you say scientists
        - Could you maybe say instead of me
        - So how would you restate that question
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could answer this question
        - In your own words
        - I was wondering, um, can you describe the machine at STUDENT
        - Like, is there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine
        - What, what does the machine
        - My next question was going to be
        - What does the machine do, could you add a little bit more detail into your answer
        - STUDENT, you just answered my next question
        - Yeah, you should you should make sure that you add as much detail as you can in your answer
        - So it's nice and specific, so I know exactly what you're talking about
        - It's really important to make sure that STUDENT of our answers come straight from the text
        - I'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and say why having more space on a spaceship is good
        - What kind of machine to discover water?
        - So you STUDENT just need to be a little more specific
        - So, how will you revise your answer that include the equipment
        - Teacher : So I would have liked to see more information, more describing it
        - Teacher : Right, so I would like to see you some context from the story to be able to answer that question
        - Does that make sense
        - We need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text
        - However, when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us
        - To use evidence from the text in front of us
        - So it's just a matter of combining your two answers
        - That's right, to make a complete sentence, though, we usually we use the words already sorry we usually use the words from the question given to us right
        - If we use background information
        - So those are STUDENT pieces of equipment
        - However, when we're answering a question to a text that we've read, we need to be just using evidence from the text
        - So we need to be using the texts given when we're answering a question about the given tax
        - So we want our answers to be as specific as possible
        - When does it do what is it, what does that tool used for? It's to find water on the moon, but how?
        - And let's be more specific, so if you look in that paragraph itself tells you exactly what it does
        - Yes, a specific name maybe right so let's look back at the text
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What was the small machine called
        - Do you remember
        - So your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine, but I want to see more detail
        - I know that you could pull more detail from this
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer
        - What was this small machine called and what was it there to do
        - Let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete
        - So now that you see where we got our answer
        - So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you
        - And then, as we're looking at Jazmin's answer to what do you think we could add to it
        - So I'm going to suggest that your STUDENT keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually
        - You think that you would refer to the text
        - I think that's a great idea to help us expand upon our answer to add some details from the text to show that we truly understand what we're reading
        - I love that idea
        - And you can do that independently right now
        - So you can add that to your answer
        - I mean, when you answer a question
        - When I say is evidence from the text
        - I would like for you to use something that you have read in the story, or in the article to help support your answer and to help others who are reading understand how you got to answer
        - We want to be so explicit and explaining or so detailed in explaining what we're talking about that they understand
        - When we answer questions, it's helpful to think about if we were answering a question and someone who has no idea on what we're talking about
        - and we want to add evidence from the text to show how we got our answer to support our answer
        - That it's not, that's not the right answer
        - But when a question is asked  we want to make sure we're answering that question and connection to the text and we want to use evidence from the text to support our answer
        - No one is here because they answer is wrong
        - We should be so specific that someone who has not read this text
        - But when we answer questions about an informational texts, we need to be very specific
        - They should be able to learn something
        - When they read our answer to the question, they should, they should be able to know what it is we're talking about
        - But can you tell me more about the machine
        - Can you be more specific, while using evidence from the text, something to support your answer
        - What type of machine was it
        - You was on to the right path of getting to the answer that NASA sent a small machine they did
        - Yes, we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer
        - We don't want to talk about things
        - That's not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing
        - That's very true what you said
        - But as I said earlier, we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked
        - So my suggestion would be to find some reasons why, even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future
        - So my suggestion would be to keep what you have, but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon
        - yeah, why is it in, because we know water is important here too, we need to just survive, why is it such a big deal that now water is found on the moon
        - To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little
        - yeah it will be great if you look back to the second paragraph, so can you just look closely about this for up and I go back to you later
        - yeah great yeah so, can you find those equipments NUTS scientists use it to discover water, not for brees back in the article for me
        - The sentence that include these three keywords
        - I was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first, excuse me, the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that we can That you can use as evidence for this answer,
        - There's always extra information, we can find in different language that we could use To answer the question even better
        - I would just say that it's something that we can improve on
        - Well, I wouldn't say it's wrong
        - So for you, I would say, Read we read that part and see if you can add another like detail on to it
        - Maybe think about The equipment's looking for water, but maybe
        - Where's the water or maybe something to that effect, we can really make a more detailed answer
        - So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text
        - I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper
        - Something else that links with that to help further your answer
        - So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle
        - Can you do that for me
        - So I want you to underline what you did answer, which was NASA sent a small machine so underlined small machine
        - A little bit more
        - And then I want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer
        - and wondering if we can get a little bit more specific
        - but i'm wondering if we can get a little bit more specific
        - i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific, so what were they sending the small machines for
        - I don't think your answers wrog STUDENT i'm just wondering if we can find a little bit more evidence for this small machine that you're saying that they send
        - Well, I think your answers right there right, so you said NASA send a small machine I would include the rest of that sentence in your answer, so what was that small machine called
        - awesome yeah I think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water
        - So i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - wondering if you STUDENT wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can use, we can find a more specific answer so
        - but I want to, we talked a little bit about um adding in those details so remember when I was talking to STUDENT about
        - STUDENT i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed
        - let's get a little bit deeper into that I think we can expand our answer a little bit um So yes
        - so when we have a question that tells us to use the text
        - I was wondering if you STUDENT could be any more specific with that
        - can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is I want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment
        - But i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what are their information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission
        - so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text
        - Alright STUDENT um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it, I want you to be a little more specific, so you told me that NASA sent a small machine which is absolutely true, can you tell me what that small machine was called?
        - Very good, there you go, we just want to be a little more specific there and then we are good to go
        - yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story
        - yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and
        - Right, do you think you could add that to your answer
        - yeah So how do you, do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon?
        - I think you could also talk about your own experience, going to NASA
        - Well, if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text, so you have this experience with NASA and learning about the equipment
        - So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering STUDENT this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place?
        - yeah so maybe you could include that
        - yeah maybe include that
        - yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why why we would need to look for water on the moon
        - I was saying that STUDENT else, I want you to dig a little bit deeper right right now we're in space we're looking for our water, so how can you be more specific in your answer when you say NASA sent a small machine how
        - But we want to figure out, we want to be as specific as possible, for example, when you go into your math STUDENT right and you say we use a lot of tools for math Okay, but you when you're trying to calculate you don't pull out your ruler right
        - So I think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine
        - But it was a great start, good job STUDENT
        - Um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response
        - and give me the actual word with the citing source, then you will get the answer okay okay
        - On the machine oh that's Okay, next time, can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's STUDENT oh
        - yeah okay great and then go ahead and change your answer, if you think you need to okay and i'm going to move on to talk to um
        - You can do that too, you can kind of mix it in
        - Let me go ahead and take a look at your answer NASA send a small machine, so your answer is not wrong, I would just love it if you could explain it a little bit more and be a little bit more specific so
        - and see if there's a way that you can use it to help make your answer, more specific
        - so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer
        - Why you got there that you think, yes, it could be valuable and then some other supporting evidence for how
        - We perhaps would be focusing a lot more on the text that has been given to us in order to come up with a specific response to that question
        - that's true that's true um What if you were to name that machine
        - But i'm wondering if so let's go back to that question again what equipment, so we want to make sure I answer has equipment discover water great
        - you STUDENT have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers, and I want you to make sure see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move
        - And I would say, I would add, try to be as specific as possible
        - But I wonder if we can go a little further, I want to see if we can build on your explanation, a little bit so a small machine, would you be able to know what that machine is called, would you happen to know that
        - At this point, we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and I love how, when you went back you're able to find The actual name of that small machine that they sent
        - so thank you STUDENT just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of them, the information that you found
        - So I think that would be a great idea STUDENT
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that STUDENT now I would love for you to share with me, is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling?
        - I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer
        - Then STUDENT What about you can you go ahead and maybe tell us what's your what might be added to your response
        - I really liked your response, because that is so true you did a great job on that response i'd like you to get a little bit more specific with that
        - I definitely agree with you that the scientists are using oxygen tanks, but I really want us to answer this question with something that we found in the text
        - And you are, you are correct was certain extent, but we're going to be even more specific right they sent up a satellite
        - yeah, a really good answer would say both
        - And then, for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon, to take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that
        - hi STUDENT with your response, I did say that you include a piece of equipment, but I think it could be more specific right, I think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about
        - Exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing
        - yep and then, of course, because we're amazing students, you want to make sure that the last thing we do is we always explain our why, and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that
        - Yes, pull out that one
        - Right, so can we get more specific, to help us have a better knowledge base here, do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific
        - Okay, great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right,so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle STUDENT and I think that would be a much clearer response
        - yeah STUDENT I really appreciate that you have a strong interest in this film and I know from your answer that you're really an expert in this
        - that's an awesome answer STUDENT, I think, maybe to make it a little bit more detailed, you can include the name of the small machine
        - Water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those key words and using that evidence from the text, can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely
        - So you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good
        - So we know that NASA sent a small machine, but what kind of small machine was it?
        - yeah so there's those are some details that you can use to describe things
        - I could tell from your answer and I think that that is really helping you In Olivereloping your response
        - So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question STUDENT
        - about the kind of equipment that scientists used, so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using
        - I would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things, but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine, but the scientists were using
        - However, I want to challenge you to not do the blah blah blah parts and to see if we can actually name we're looking for
        - keep STUDENT should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so
        - Oh well, when I was looking at your answers and now as i'm talking to you STUDENT i'm noticing that when we're talking we're picking out some of the smaller details
        - And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use
        - to discover the water on the moon, I think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about
        - hmm, how do you think we can work a lunar orbiter into our answers? It says that they used it to investigate
        - but just to make sure that we're STUDENT on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text, but maybe in the future when we're going further, you can use all your NASA experience that'd be great
        - Second, paragraph does talk about a small machine that NASA used, but I want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific
        - Alright, so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to
        - So, given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer, I want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking
        - response, so I want you that can you tell me, I know that in your answer you said you circle, the same as STUDENT but can you put the answer to the question in your own words
        - But I always think it's really nice when you include some background knowledge like STUDENT did so, if you did, that great if you didn't it's no big deal
        - Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing
        - um, so I think if we kind of bring STUDENT of these things together, we can get a more full answer
        - yeah let's take a look at that um I think if you STUDENT have your text in front of you, it might be a great time to take a look at Jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment
        - yeah great and so um I think of work to put STUDENT of these pieces together into a full answer
        - yeah absolutely, so I think if you put these two different pieces, together, we have a really complete answer
        - I would say, maybe let's elaborate a little bit and let's get some other perspectives, so does STUDENT else
        - But for now we're just looking at the evidence in the text right that we can use to answer the question, but that is great knowledge to have so if I need evidence in the text right, I might use
        - so I think you're on a good track, but if you look at the passage to you can um yeah find the word investigate
        - You have to be more specific than that in the in the answer to the response
        - Well, I believe you're right but um to answer this question, we will have to find the evidence in the text so we're not really thinking about
        - The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for
        - So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect
        - way to add a little bit more to it, yes
        - however, we can make our explanations even stronger by using more context from the problem
        - And you were right with that you weren't wrong, but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail, instead of just saying small machine
        - Yes, so just to make sure that you do go into more detail about what it is and that's really the only thing, so if you say that it's a small machine
        - You could yeah you could say that I would also make sure you say what's in the text, though, because the questions asking mainly what's in the text so just make sure you
        - If you know it's correct if if you're like unsure about it, I wouldn't but um
        - yeah can you take a moment to add that into your response
        - So maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it
        - Exactly similar to STUDENT you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon
        - STUDENT perfect take a moment, you can add that in
        - so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention, in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there
        - I didn't say that your answer was wrong, I think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article, but I wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence
        - So my suggestion To make your answer stronger is to keep reading and then check
        - So why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread
- intent: r120.3
  examples: |
        - And STUDENT Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?
        - Excellent and STUDENT could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle
        - And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around STUDENT, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one For the name of the equipment they use
        - Excellent STUDENT could you read the second paragraph, for us
        - STUDENT just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us
        - can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking STUDENT
        - One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me STUDENT
        - can you reread that chunk of the text for me
        - Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's STUDENT look back at our question
        - Let's look back at number one
        - Do you want to if you STUDENT want to read this question for me
        - STUDENT, do you want to read it for me
        - So we are going to look back in our passage
        - So I will STUDENT to get back into their passage
        - Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - The water they found is microscopic
        - Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - Go back to the text and look
        - The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate
        - Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment
        - Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage
        - Can you look at your passage with me
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters
        - And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, Farrah and and the STUDENT
        - If you look at their paragraph four
        - So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?
        - Would you like STUDENT, would you like to read the second paragraph?
        - So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?
        - Can STUDENT tell me
        - Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be
        - Let's look back at the text
        - Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Can who can read that for sentence to me
        - Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot
        - This would hold only 32 ounces of water
        - But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again
        - And I want to challenge, just like STUDENT, take a look at that question
        - Can you read the question for me
        - Let me point you in the right direction
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three
        - Look at paragraph three
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        - Look at that question again
        - Can you read it out loud for me
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate
        - STUDENT, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph
        - Question number one out loud for us
        - Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read
        - So could I have someone
        - Will you read
        - I saw your hand first
        - Question number one for us, please
        - STUDENT, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence
        - Can you, can STUDENT look back at number three on your document
        - So let's see
        - I'm gonna stop you there
        - We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        - Can you do that for me?
        - All right, so, STUDENT, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading
        - so STUDENT, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?
        - So can you STUDENT look back at paragraph two?
        - So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence
        - What does it say STUDENT?
        - Now, STUDENT, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?
        - Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two
        - Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        - STUDENT It will you read the question back to me
        - But we look back at the question for me
        - If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me
        - And then in the second paragraph, right there
        - Okay, so, but before we do that can STUDENT
        - Will you read the question aloud to the STUDENT, please
        - Would you read it aloud place
        - how about STUDENT Would you go back and read paragraph two for us
        - STUDENT we read it to me one more time
        - So let's look at the question again
        - That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you
        - So if STUDENT else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now
        - So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response
        - So why don't you read that question for me again
        - Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so STUDENT wants to read the second question for us
        - So, but if we look on down in paragraph
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - In their paper with me
        - Okay, so STUDENT look at your paper
        - STUDENT, can you just read that for me again
        - Let's look at paragraph two
        - What did you just just read it one more time for me
        - STUDENT, can, can you look back at your reading in paragraph two, and read that one more time for us? Okay
        - So when you look back at your reading
        - And that they use equipment to search for things
        - The whole thing a paragraph two,
        - And then I would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine, what actually let's have STUDENT read that sentence for us
        - Can you read the next sentence for me STUDENT
        - Okay, so let's look down the next sentence past that one
        - And it's look at, let's read paragraph number three
        - The water they found is, what's the word there?
        - Okay ready okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest or driest desert on Earth
        - So if you look at paragraph number three
        - I'm going to read it
        - You follow along
        - So let's go back to, and I think you pulled that right out of paragraph five, can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five, for me, STUDENT
        - Okay, and what else does it say about it
        - Okay, so if we look back to paragraph four, it says that water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource you see the very first sentence on paragraph four, okay
        - It could be useful in a lot of ways
        - Well, let's look at it together
        - Look at paragraph five,
        - It says, water is a valuable resource
        - I want you to reread that and raise your hand after you've reread that passage
        - I want you to go back and look at the passage
        - STUDENT, are we rereading, make sure you're reading our passage
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - You remember that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Because in paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that when ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - That's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day
        - Okay, so let's look back to paragraph
        - So it says water on the moon would be a valuable or very important resource
        - Paragraph four right we're under this heading where it says, water is valid, a valuable resource
        - Okay, well let's go back and reread so water on the moon will be a valuable or very important resource, it can be useful in a lot of ways
        - For example, future astronauts could drink this water
        - Water is heavy
        - And it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things
        - Moon water could be useful and other ways, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts can breathe oxygen, hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Look back into paragraph 3, and can you read that aloud for me? About what they use to find the water in space, on the moon
        - So if you look back at that third paragraph, can you read that first sentence for me, STUDENT?
        - But what does the first sentence say?
        - Can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those STUDENT, can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine
        - Yes, those are great equipment words
        - So can some, STUDENT or one of you, which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1?
        - Go ahead, STUDENT
        - Are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert?
        - Did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three? And then we'll talk about those four answers
        - Let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3
        - So paragraph 3
        - Who would like to read 3? STUDENT, would you like to read it?
        - But that's a very good start
        - So let's keep reading paragraph 3, and then we're going to go back, and we're going it's kind of getting more information, OK
        - Who would like to read three?
        - So in the text, I think it was in
        - In paragraph five, it says, imagine the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas tanks before heading out into the solar system, so they could visit further white areas of the solar system, or they could come back home with the fuel that they yeah
        - Other questions, man
        - Oh gosh, remind me
        - And while you're reading it
        - So read that sentence again for me
        - I'm going to talk with STUDENT
        - Let's STUDENT look at our text
        - and in our text when we look at our texts
        - So what machine was used to find the water
        - So I think we STUDENT need to reread the passage
        - Okay, one more time
        - I'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again
        - STUDENT right, well let's uh, we are actually I'm gonna let some friends take turns reading, who would like to read first?
        - So as we continue into paragraph two it states NASA sent a small machine
        - So we're going to move down to paragraph number three
        - Can you STUDENT find paragraph number three
        - So let's look back at
        - paragraphs three and four specifically
        - Okay, so let's look back at paragraphs three and four for about a minute
        - A minute to look back at paragraphs three and four, and then I'll give you about two minutes to talk
        - How's that sound
        - As a STUDENT, look back at paragraphs three and four
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter landed on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - The beginning of paragraph two, okay
        - Let's look back individually
        - Let's look back, I'll give you STUDENT about a minute or so individually
        - So this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole to look for ice deposits
        - Let's look, paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Let's look back at the text
        - So if you look at our original question
        - Let's go back and Decode that question
        - That's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs
        - But let's look back at this specific article because this is about water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at paragraph two,
        - water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Everybody look back with us and STUDENT read that sentence that you found NASA sent a small machine
        - What do you see there?
        - Hey, you want to take a quick look at your article that you read
        - You could look at the sentence
        - It says rocket fuel
        - It's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways
        - The second part where waters valuable resource
        - The part of the paragraph
        - Could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer
        - I've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so STUDENT
        - Well, why would finding water on the moon useful
        - But if we go back in the text, and we just need to clarify
        - Teacher:Chris can We go to paragraph two,
        - Very first in its
        - STUDENT Can you read the second sentence and paragraph two,
        - but what we really want to focus on is more of this reading
        - And so why don't you go ahead and read the discussion question for us
        - Can I get you to read the question
        - Can I get STUDENT to read the question for us, please
        - Okay, so let's go back at a our article, so STUDENT look at your article
        - STUDENT, you had a great question there
        - STUDENT right, who would like to read the first part there
        - Can I get you to do it, STUDENT
        - Alright, STUDENT read that, the number one
        - STUDENT right, who would like to read number two
        - Okay, let's let STUDENT, will you read number two
        - Can I get you to read number three
        - You, why don't you go ahead you and STUDENT, why don't you go ahead and take a moment to read back again starting from paragraph one and see if you can underline what they use to discover water on the moon
        - Teacher:And then also I would like you
        - So can you read back the question for me
        - We need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question
        - they they use the small machine, the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - These deposits are very small
        - NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for US Department posits in a large polar crater
        - And then in paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on Earth
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And then if you look in at then at the next
        - Ever end the end we're going to look at the next paragraph and so
        - So what is the question we're trying to answer
        - So let's look back at the text
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look in the text
        - Do you, can you STUDENT see the text
        - Let's look at the third paragraph
        - Does STUDENT want to read that for me
        - The second paragraph, under the moon is a desert
        - So can you read to me, please
        - Well, you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and STUDENT that good stuff
        - Yeah, read the next sentence
        - Can you read that
        - According to paragraph two, what does it do, again, what's the second sentence say
        - Um, what do you think it does
        - will you reread the question for me
        - And it can you continue for the next two sentences
        - The scientist, it says that they need a microscope to look closely
        - Alright, so first of all, let's look at the question so STUDENT, would you go ahead and read the question to us
        - I want to look back at the question so STUDENT, would you go ahead and read the question for us
        - Okay, well I do see oxygen tanks and it's actually in paragraph five, so I'd like STUDENT to look at paragraph five,
        - So it says the moon
        - To look at paragraph and we're going to see why we're going to see why that doesn't work
        - Water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Water could be useful in other ways
        - Okay, so go ahead and read that last sentence for us
        - How about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and I want to see if we can hone in on it
        - So, STUDENT, why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us
        - Thank you so much for summer for us but I loved your summary
        - And you mentioned one piece of equipment that's used, let's go back and look at paragraph one into
        - but read the question to me one more time
        - So, let's go back up the text has one, two, and three
        - So in looking at the one, two, and three, they're short little sentences
        - Let's look at number two, the sentence starts with NASA
        - Okay so reread that
        - Okay, so that number two we just read, read
        - And it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small
        - So, reading back through and what STUDENT had just talked about with this small machine
        - First, we go back to the question itself
        - Would you be okay to read the final sentence there
        - Oh, yes, yes
        - Yeah, the one starts with that the final sentence there
        - Can you look back in the text and see
        - So let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me
        - Can you read paragraph two for me
        - So if you look back, paragraph two, can you read that for me
        - So I want you to go back and I'd like you to look at paragraph number five
        - So we need to look and paragraph number two
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon surface
        - In paragraph number two
        - The first sentence
        - Or the South Pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small
        - So the water they found is microscopic and it says, meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it
        - All right, STUDENT, let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one
        - STUDENT saw your hand first
        - Let's go with you
        - Hi, STUDENT, I saw your hand first
        - I'm just going to quickly read because we're crunching on time
        - I'm going to very quickly read starting in paragraph two follow along with me
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for an ice deposit in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small, scientists said that up to one ton sorry one ton of top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - So, would you mind Chris, would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the STUDENT, please
        - Yeah, I see, I see
        - In the last minute
        - Let's look specifically at
        - Well, I'm just going to read the whole thing quickly for myself, NASA send a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate that lunar orbiter would land in the south pole deposits
        - These ice deposits for very small sounds
        - It says that one of the top 10 layers
        - That was for myself
        - Thank you STUDENT and that they would contain water
        - How about we look halfway down
        - Do you see the sign the sinister begin scientists said that one ton, you see that sentence
        - I'm going to read that for STUDENT of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water
        - Well, let's look at paragraph three reading
        - Do me a favor, I want you to look at paragraph five,
        - Okay, so with your eyes closed and you've got that picture of the craters in your mind
        - I'm going to read you this paragraph
        - The water they found is microscopic
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - I would use it
        - If you STUDENT have your text handy
        - Okay, so let's take a look at the text
        - So see, let's see if we can look back and find the answer in the story
        - So if we look back in the story
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning
        - It wouldn't be able to see
        - under paragraph three, it says that means the moon is still drive and the desert dries desert on Earth
        - See if you look straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - These deposits are very small
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for us deposits in a large polar crater
        - So paragraph two, says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - That means the moon is still draw than the driest desert on earth
        - If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - Why don't we STUDENT take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me
        - yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay
        - It says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - So water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely
        - STUDENT right, can you read that to me please
        - We learned about how scientists found evidence that water can be found on the moon's polar craters these craters are in dark places that the sun never shines
        - NASA, which is the big space station that sends stuff to the moon
        - Sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to to look for these polar craters that have the water in them
        - And then we found the water, but the water is microscopic
        - I want you to like for STUDENT else go back and reread because in the small, the first paragraph, is where you got that from
        - So now we're going to reflect on what STUDENT shared there
        - STUDENT want to read out loud, the first, second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter
        - So I want STUDENT to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two
        - Alright perfect so i'll give you STUDENT a second, if you want to read the first three paragraphs just read
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely STUDENT
        - So before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them, I want you STUDENT to reread and look at the paragraph four, five and six in your reading once you guys are done, we can look at, we can keep going with this lesson
        - What I want you STUDENT to do is to look at that reading, one more time
        - So on the first text it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within moons create polar craters us craters are dark places that the sun never shines
        - I'll we know NASA has sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks like a night looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - The water they found is microscopic Microsoft
        - For the third call it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - Microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it
        - If you were looking straight at it, you need to scientific tool called the Microsoft look very close
        - The discussion question was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um would STUDENT like to read the question, the first question for us
        - Um would STUDENT like to read the question, the first question for us
        - So we, we just read the moon is a desert and I asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - awesome I am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely, if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes, starting now to read
        - So i'm going to give you one minute to review the text you STUDENT can let me know if you're done before that
        - So we have NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - but I want to reread it again I want to show you a sentence, and I think it's a
        - three, paragraph three, it says that means the moon, is still drier than the driest desert on earth, they found water that is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - would be a valuable or very important resource, it could be useful in lots of ways, for example, future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is
        - Would you be able to read that last sentence for us, then, as a STUDENT
        - Rocket! Exactly it says here the moon could serve as a stop for spacecrafts to refill their gas
        - why don't we look back at the question is just read it one more time, can you read it out loud for me
        - It did so, I want you to read read me the question out loud
        - These creators are dark places where the sun never shines
        - So scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's cooler craters
        - So if we read, question number in the first response
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - So now reading number two, so NASA send a small machine called lunar over order to investigate this order looks for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - Let's move on to the last one
        - That means that the moon is still drier than a dry desert on Earth
        - You'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - Can you find it and that's in paragraph 2
        - Does STUDENT want to go back and read over in paragraph 5?
        - Can STUDENT go back and read the number Paragraph to where it starts with NASA sent a small, can you read that those first couple sentences of that paragraph, please
        - But let's kind of read
        - I believe it's the first sentence and paragraph two, can you read that whole sentence
        - Can you read the sentence that you found that in
        - Yes, just take a second and reread it
        - Let's look at Paragraph two, where NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter books for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two
        - So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now
        - Actually let's start with just paragraph two
        - Yeah, maybe reread it once or twice, just to see, okay,
        - Okay, now you can start to read the task now
        - Teacher : NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - So, Luis, or STUDENT
        - Teacher : The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called or microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, and STUDENT can you reread that first question?
        - Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer
        - Can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me, please
        - and then STUDENT, can you reread the part about the Lunar Orbiter
        - Um, can you read the next two sentences for me
        - Can someone read reread paragraph two, for me, where it begins with NASA send a small machine, who can read that for me
        - So can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me
        - but let's read the next step
        - So let's start by looking back at the question again
        - So can someone read the question out loud to me
        - So the way that I would try to find the answer to that is by looking back in the text
        - That's a really good question
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Each ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day
        - Could someone read that out loud to me
        - So why don't we begin by just reviewing the question one more time
        - So why don't we STUDENT work on that together
        - So could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me STUDENT
        - You were talking about which equipment they were using first and let's if I would suggest you revisit the question one more time
        - Can you read what that question is
        - STUDENT, can you read?
        - Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - The second one is NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - And then our third fact is that means the moon is still drier than the driest or desert on Earth
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, so what I want you to do is I want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out
        - Can you read that whole sentence to me, starting from the beginning
        - Oh, so it says this Lunar Orbiter
        - Will look for deposits
        - NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, so I see where you're looking
        - The Moon is a desert
        - It is water on the Moon
        - Scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth
        - Okay, I'm going to continue reading number three
        - If you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - So you just answered a question about, I'm not exactly sure what it was with someone like to raise their hand and tell me what you just read and what you just answered, STUDENT
        - Maybe someone can read it from their book from their icon
        - Oh, I love to hear what you know about space right now I want to focus on the question that we had to ask, what was it exactly do you have the text in front of you
        - I can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph
        - Can you reread the question to me
        - Can you reread the question to me
        - Even I want you to go back to the text and reread pragraphs one and three
        - Okay, STUDENT looked back and paragraph two,
        - But I would like, for you to reread for me, the first sentence of paragraph three, can you read that allowed for us STUDENT
        - Um, can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me
        - Um, I wanted to point a specific area I wanted us to read together
        - Can you read the second sentence out loud to me
        - So can you go back to the text and think about the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - But how about we look once again at the text you know
        - But so i'm curious if we can look through the text again
        - yeah well that's the cool thing about this text, so it kind of explains it um STUDENT, do you mind reading section two out loud
        - Can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me?
        - Okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud, for me, can you do that
        - So Would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different, at the end
        - Oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two, with me really quick, can you read that first sentence for me
        - Totally, so we're going back to the question, so what what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon,
        - You know what Farrah that's a great point can we STUDENT look at our text and look at the second paragraph
        - Farrah or STUDENT That was a great point, could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer
        - And then also I want Farrah Oliver and Chris, will you STUDENT look at the fourth paragraph and then Jazmin and Luis will you guys look at the bottom, the last two sentences in the fifth paragraph?
        - Yes, sorry I think I drew your attention to the wrong part of that paragraph, will you read the i'm going to read it to you that way I don't have to keep telling you which sentence "moon water could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen"
        - Rocket fuel can help spacecrafts to move," just like a gas helps cars
        - "astronauts can breathe oxygen, oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Okay that's Okay, if you STUDENT have the texts in front of you, we can look where it says number two do you see where it says number two i'll read it for you, it says NASA
        - Take a look specifically at paragraph two
        - Can you take a look at the the title for me, can you read the title of the article for me?
        - STUDENT, you mentioned that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - awesome great yeah we does STUDENT see in the first sentence and paragraph two, it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate great i'm seeing head nods
        - Yes, so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, can you read the next sentence out loud, for us, please
        - Alright, so I want STUDENT to focus in on the second sentence and we're going to look at it in paragraph two, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so
        - yeah that is that is 100% correct, but can I have somebody read question one out loud for us again
        - and specifically what is the sentence say
        - Okay, do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer?
        - That you're on the right path right, and so I want you to do the same thing as STUDENT just looked at that text because again
        - Exactly, so what I want STUDENT to do now is take a look at the text and we are going to read the first paragraph again together
        - The moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's color craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - STUDENT should look at your paragraph
        - Good now let's look at the second paragraph together NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small
        - That means the moon, is still dryer and it's a very fun for
        - Okay, and can you read that out loud, for us, please
        - mm hmm so let me read that part, the first part, or part two together so NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - This lunar orbiter will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - I think we just need to take a moment to look back at what we read
        - So when I say go, you have one minute to review your three little paragraphs and then we'll come back together to talk okay go ahead
        - and STUDENT can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So STUDENT can you read the question again that we're working to answer
        - STUDENT can you read the question for me
        - So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text STUDENT, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead
        - but now STUDENT can you give it another try, can you read, can we can you read, part two of the decks
        - Okay, you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah STUDENT would you like to just read the text for us again
        - So how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two, can you can can STUDENT use that paragraph two, can you read it out loud for us
        - yeah yeah and, since you and STUDENT you guys are agreeing each other, can I have Farrah read the third paragraph
        - Oh, you didn't know about the water and that's incredible well if you actually go back to the passage in the first paragraph
        - so let's start from the beginning, so if you go back to the question I love to have you wide, so why don't you try reading the question again
        - but STUDENT can you read the question for us, do you have it
        - there's a little bit more keep reading
        - so once again can STUDENT can you read the question, one more time for me
        - Okay Okay, so I can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it STUDENT
        - Can you read the sentence before that STUDENT
        - and take a couple of minutes to read it, while I connect with your fellow space enthusiasts classmates and maybe you can also kind of keep an ear open while you're reading and and get a sense of what your classmates got out of it so STUDENT what yes Jazmin
        - There is paragraph two, could you go ahead and look at paragraph two
        - that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more
        - mm hmm that is a great question so if we look at the text that we read it says that the Lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says, STUDENT, yes, Chris?
        - So maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a STUDENT, we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that
        - yeah I want to take a look at that article again that water on the moon article that piece from it says
        - adapted from the New York Times that piece you read, I want you to go back, but I want to see if we can flesh out what Jazmin's talking about here
        - The water or identified the water so let's STUDENT go back to that text and i'm going to give you just a few few seconds, maybe 30 seconds
        - Oh yeah you're absolutely right i've seen that line, it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - STUDENT yeah, thank you
        - i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again
        - I know we had a question to start us off that was I don't know Can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this STUDENT
        - Okay, thank you for responding STUDENT so i'm wants to go back and I think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so Chris, if you can look at the third paragraph and I want you to just, would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph Chris?
        - So STUDENT, actually read the next sentence too
        - I want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us, what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to STUDENT
        - In in writing those responses, so what I want everybody to do is I want you to read the question, one more time Okay, we oh STUDENT you have a question go ahead
        - but can you actually read the question out loud, for me, can you read the question
        - Which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me
        - um can you read that part in the text out loud for me
        - But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, STUDENT
        - can I have a volunteer to read this question out loud, please
        - Right, so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great
        - yeah so we've used evidence from paragraph to hand paragraph three let's take another look at paragraph one and see if there's any other information there that we can use
        - Does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us?
        - yeah thanks STUDENT go ahead and read paragraph one for us
        - So the first thing that I want us to do we're going to look back at actually what the question is asking us
        - STUDENT right, go ahead and look backward in the text, what about the rest of us
        - i'm wondering, could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for STUDENT
        - And the next part of the question
        - Part two great thanks for referencing us all to the text so STUDENT look take a look at your text right paragraph two right NASA send a small machine
        - let's go back to the question, can you maybe the first
        - So um, do you know what is our question for today?
        - yeah definitely definitely agree, so the universe is so mysterious, and there is very large space for us to explore
        - STUDENT, could you please read it, for us, the first sentence
        - but anyone read it out to the whole STUDENT
        - yeah and um Could you also please read, for us, the first sentence of Part two
        - All right, you all gave such great responses to this question now, I just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it, and if you could just follow along yes STUDENT
        - Great so it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Okay yeah in the text
        - And so it says the water they found is microscopic meaning they wouldn't be able to see it if it were, if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - yeah, so why don't we take a look at paragraph two together so can STUDENT take a moment and maybe just reread paragraph two, to yourself
        - So maybe um I wonder if STUDENT could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy
        - If you guys can STUDENT look at that second paragraph that starts with the word NASA
        - STUDENT do you mind reading that first sentence out loud
        - Okay, great um STUDENT do you want to read that paragraph three, for us, maybe just focusing on the last sentence there
        - It says this lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in the large polar crater
        - Water on the moon, I want us to take a look, though back at the question that was being asked and I want us to think about oh yes STUDENT
        - Now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can STUDENT read for me the question that we need to answer
        - so I want to go back to what STUDENT said so Jazmin can you read actually the first sentence of paragraph to read the whole sentence, where you found the answer okay
        - Oh Okay, so can you keep going and read the next sentence
        - Ah, OK that's a great point so let's go back to the microscope So what does it say
        - What does it say on paragraph three, about the microscope um can anyone start reading with the sentence that says, the second sentence and paragraph three STUDENT
        - is actually showing the text but STUDENT I want you to read the question more closely
        - So what does the question ask us?
        - I want you to read closely about the paragraphs, the second paragraph,
        - Can we look at test again and
        - Good cool all right, so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon, and so our first question, can I was wondering if someone can remind me STUDENT you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us?
        - Alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part, do you mind repeating the question for us?
        - Alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you STUDENT in your groups you guys can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay
        - Alright, so the main question I wanted to help you STUDENT answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question
        - Well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can I get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context
        - let's STUDENT take a look at that part of paragraph two, there, right at the beginning NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Okay, so this this might work for you to this next suggestion, so what I might do is do a little bit of rereading
- intent: r120.2
  examples: |
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes STUDENT
        - So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon
        - So today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, so thank you STUDENT for sharing your answers
        - So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water
        - So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - What equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - So you answered the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, thank you very much
        - So listen closely
        - Yeah, I'm going to read the question
        - Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon
        - Did they use to discover that water
        - STUDENT of you can take a look at the question again
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you can take a look at your passage
        - And in your question
        - Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, we've just answered what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at our passage and see what equipment
        - Did they use to find that
        - Okay, but we're going to what equipment
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So let's look back at our question
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water
        - So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water
        - Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right, so STUDENT, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon
        - The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon
        - What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water
        - Does that help?
        - So let's look at your responses
        - So the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - But so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, please, can you please read the question again
        - And STUDENT, you can you please read the question again?
        - One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon
        - Okay, let's talk about the questions
        - So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover
        - So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific
        - What did they use to discover
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment
        - Did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - It would be a good answer to the question, right
        - Let's look at the question again
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the
        - Moon could be valuable
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look back at our question
        - Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this
        - Okay, I've read your responses to our question
        - Let me reread the question again
        - Let me read
        - Hold on just one second
        - The question was what equipment did scientist us to discover water on moon
        - So our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon
        - What do you think they sent
        - Okay, so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - but does is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Why do you think that the scientists used on the moon
        - Why don't you start with what it, what
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question that we're going to talk about this time around is
        - I'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What are the key words in that question
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So the question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What, we're going to look at the question
        - The question was what equipment good scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - And what equipment did they use
        - because the question said is there convincing evidence that, you know, water is valuable and
        - So what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - Now let's see is, does STUDENT want to share why they think water could be valuable?
        - Alright, so we just talked read the article water on the moon
        - And the question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But can you find what the what NASA used to investigate the water on the moon?
        - So can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon?
        - But when they were able to discover some, how did they discover it?
        - They sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment
        - So, and our question said that NASA
        - Did they sebd to investigate water
        - Okay, so now what does it say that they sent
        - What did they send to investigate
        - Our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Because we need to know which
        - Equipment did the scientists sees to discover the water right to discover the water so
        - So what if I put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was
        - So, question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - That's our question to
        - Um, so my question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Okay, so, um,
        - What equipment do they use to find the water
        - So while I'm talking to
        - because we were talking about the question is there convincing evidence that
        - So do you think it would be
        - Important to have water on the moon
        - Our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look at our question
        - So it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Let's start off with rereading the question
        - And we want to know what the scientists use to find water on the moon
        - The question was we read our story
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT right, so let's talk about the question
        - STUDENT gave a different answer
        - What equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right, who heard in that story what they use
        - What was the name of that scientific tool
        - Well, let's look at our discussion question
        - Now, have STUDENT already thought of your answers for this question?
        - It said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question that we have first is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right, you STUDENT
        - With your with your answer to, number one, which says what equipment did scientists, you discover water on the moon
        - What equipment is used to discover water on the moon
        - So the question is asking us what equipment did scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - And it asked you to circle the evidence in the text
        - Oh well, our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our question is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So we're going to go over our reading passage that you STUDENT did water on the moon
        - And so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT right, I appreciate it
        - Alright, so the second question, we're going to look at is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - We talked about what is is there considerable evidence to show that water is valuable
        - So it says if they're convincing evidence that water on the moon Could be valuable
        - So the second question that we had was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value
        - Okay, so the question at hand is what equipment to the scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - So have STUDENT you thought about that?
        - But what we want to talk about today is, is what they did to discover the water on the moon, and then try to figure out what would be the value of having water on the moon
        - So I'll read the question again for you STUDENT but it was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - We're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable
        - Okay, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Where did you get the question is what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The, the second question that was asked about the you know how the moon is a desert and how water is a valuable resource
        - The second question that you know the second prompt that was given is is that is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What equipment did scientists, use to discovered water on the moon

        - So was there any other equipment that we used
        - Okay, so, um, you STUDENT were asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now the next question we were covering  Is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Alright, so we are going I had asked the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,
        - Water on the moon, and you have answered your question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But we want to look back in the article and say what tools they used on the moon
        - STUDENT What's your question
        - Responses to your questions, or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Can you help me figure out what tools that scientists needed to find water on the moon
        - Can you tell me one of those items
        - So what did you STUDENT think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So today we're going to talk about after the reading, do you think that water is a valuable resource to astronauts
        - What do you think was the most important piece of equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So when you read it, you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, let's think back to the question
        - The question was what equipment did NASA use to find water on the moon
        - What would you change your Institute
        - Remember answering that question?
        - We need to make - when we are given a question, remember the question that you guys STUDENT answered was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the five of you just STUDENT told me what your response would be to the question
        - So looking back the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I want you to go back and look at the question, so the question says is there convincing evidence that water can be valuable
        - So I know I know, so the question said, is there evidence that water can be valuable
        - Okay, so our first question is what the equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're going to focus on the question, what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - Who was that STUDENT what is it called
        - For this question we're talking about what equipment, did they use to help discover water on the moon
        - So you guys now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views, can you guys understand, do you guys understand what was used what scientists used STUDENT
        - So yes, they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks, but to discover water on the moon remember what they used
        - know what we're gonna do is we're going to focus on the question i'm sorry I lost it is there, convincing evidence that water is on what on the moon could be valuable
        - Yeah, so I just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was?
        - We're just trying to help
        - STUDENT remember what the lunar orbiter was
        - Yeah, so you know what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Oh yeah, STUDENT
        - because the question was what equipment, the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - So today we're going to be reviewing the discussion question and answers that you STUDENT had over the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Jazmin's answer was, NASA sent a small machine
        - So what tools did scientists use to find water on the moon
        - So we're looking for the equipment that scientists used to discover on the moon
        - Um so first, I just want to start by saying um just reviewing the question real quick
        - Awesome, thank you STUDENT
        - Just so I can make sure that STUDENT knows what the question is um So the question that we're that we're going to be reviewing the answers for today are what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if we were to read the question again, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So after you STUDENT read the article, we have the question to talk about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So do you STUDENT remember reading and answering the question and your notebooks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon
        - Okay, so now moving on to the second question, it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon, excuse me, could be valuable
        - considering our reading that we've already done we're going to consider the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So you STUDENT just answered what object did-- I'm so sorry
        - My name is Teacher
        - What equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon, right? OK
        - We're going to talk about that STUDENT what's your question
        - Before even before I answer your question
        - I'm just gonna review what we're going to go over
        - So we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look back at the question we're going to answer
        - And I think that might help answer your question, STUDENT
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So do you have anything to share about including evidence?
        - We are talking about including evidence to support our answers
        - Thank you, STUDENT
        - Right now we are not talking about space
        - So now, we're going to go more into the thinking aspect of answering the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - OK, and let's look back at our question to see just what we need to answer
        - So it says, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - All right, everybody, so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists, you should discover water on the moon, so I want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with Jazmin oh STUDENT you have a question
        - What that means is the question was what equipment, we used to find the water on the space on the moon, and while your answer told me the equipment that we use to look at the water
        - The question that's being asked
        - So the question that was asked was what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Right, so our question for number one was what equipment and students us to discover water on the moon
        - question has multiple parts to it um so let's like go over the question, so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but the question was asking what equipment
        - but then the question is, is there any evidence that water can be valuable
        - Is there convincing convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - But I want us
        - And the question from the assignment was what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon,
        - But the goal
        - was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the question we're answering is what equipment do scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now your answer, yes STUDENT
        - I just wanted to clarify what the question was, so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the, on the moon could be valuable
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover?
        - So let's use the first question on the reading what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look, STUDENT together, we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter
        - Because it's microscopic awesome STUDENT
        - Okay, so, STUDENT, what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So the first question as a STUDENT is, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - So let's look over our initial questions
        - So the second part of our discussion question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - And that is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable? Does STUDENT have any thoughts on that?
        - So we're going to discuss the next question
        - The evidence in the text, so that we can answer the question
        - So I just asked you the question and got your response to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And then we had a circle
        - Okay, so let's see the question that was first asked is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,
        - So we're going to look at the second question, and the question just to reiterate, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - STUDENT together, we're going to go back to the question
        - And almost STUDENT of you, I'm going to ask you to really re examine the questions That you're asked about what equipment to the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That is also a really good point so let's go back to our prompt and want STUDENT to look at and see what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so it says we're entering question
        - One question one is about the equipment
        - What else do people think is water valuable why or why not
        - The question is, what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon
        - But let's look at a question
        - Again, the question is asked, What equipment did scientist to use to discover water on the moon
        - Teacher : So I understand that we read the assignment water on the moon in your discussion question was what equipment and scientists have used to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT Do you have a question
        - So our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And I'm going to give you a minute to do this is I want you to reread the question

        - You have a question
        - Do you want to go first then STUDENT about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Talk about what they said
        - For when they answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon
        - I want you to be thinking about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover
        - And while you're listening
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the first fact is that
        - So the question that we talked about was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - For STUDENT so feel free to answer
        - And the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text
        - Wow, I'm sure you know a lot of space
        - But let's go over what our discussion question was, and that question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I see that you STUDENT have just answered your question your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon
        - Let's take a look in the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon, the water on the moon
        - Our question was, what, what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - And you said, NASA sent a small machine
        - So now if we look at your answer to our question
        - I'm going to pause in read the discussion question the discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find
        - So I saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so can we look back in the text
        - the question was, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Um, so I want
        - Of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - The two questions that will, one of the questions that we had is what equipment did scientists you to discover water on the moon
        - So two questions
        - So the first question says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we can strengthen our skills
        - I'll read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Going back to the question what equipment, the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Question number two with you STUDENT it we is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So I like to go over
        - reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, you think the most important words in the question
        - What was the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon
        - So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon
        - So I'm going to start with this question
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - To my question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The question is, there is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - We were asked you STUDENT what equipment and sciences us to discover water on the moon
        - So let's talk about the prompt
        - So I'm going to say the question one more time, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - One more time
        - So the next thing I would ask you is when you read the actual question I'm going to read the prompt
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - To put into one general idea to answer this question, so also the question more time what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um so I know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and STUDENT
        - yeah right, I thought it was super cool to i'm wondering if we can go back to the question right, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The question that we're thinking about today, that is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay um so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So does STUDENT know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon
        - ok now so hello
        - You, the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes STUDENT
        - Okay, so you can really look deep
        - Hi ya STUDENT yes
        - let's look at our discussion questions so we were supposed to think about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - so when we read our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So I want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - and you know what when i'm looking at your response to the question which was about
        - That is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great STUDENT Thank you
        - The, the question was what equipment was used to discover wate
        - Our question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon?
        - Excellent so i'm going to ask the question, one more time
        - What is that piece of equipment they used to discover that teeny bit of water?
        - So I know that first up, we have the first question we answered in our journal, which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - so First, I see a STUDENT could you share what your answer was please am the evidence
        - awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence
        - Alright STUDENT your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof
        - Could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment, did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon,
        - Alright, so go, I am now looking for the best piece of evidence that matches and talks about equipment to find water on the moon
        - Yes, thank you, but we are looking specifically for how were they able to find that water on the moon, and the way that they were able to find that water on the moon
        - for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Hi STUDENT, so our question today was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - On that water right, we want to figure out what tools or what equipment, do we use
        - What equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Chris, I see your hand STUDENT take a look what word, do you see inside of the word polar
        - Oliver I appreciate the hand up STUDENT look back at your paragraph who found that water
        - Right now we're trying to figure out exactly what piece of equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - awesome Thank you STUDENT for reading that out loud, for us, so the question is saying what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - After talking about the word investigate discover and look closely, what do we think the final answer is? what equipment did scientists use? so for this one i'm going to call on STUDENT
        - Keep in mind the question is, what did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So how about we move on to the second question
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage, let's review our question again
        - STUDENT right, come back together team
        - Okay? What was the type, what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon?
        - Okay, was STUDENT able to identify the name of the tool that was used to find water on the moon
        - did you locate the machine that found the water on the moon, the name of that machine, STUDENT
        - and let's listen keeping the question in mind, the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - answering this question, or what equipment is scientists use to discover what water on the moon
        - Now you actually gave me the results of it, but the question was what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon alright so so
        - It doesn't say circle, the evidence in the text
        - That we can use to answer this question
        - Right, they want to know what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - How did you get that answer
        - um so we I just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - yeah I I understand
        - mm hmm so let's look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Okay, so we were asked what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so does STUDENT want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover?
        - Oh, I was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon
        - I just want to make sure that you see STUDENT four components in there as well
        - Okay, go ahead and write your new answers down
        - Right, how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon
        - what tools did the astronauts use to discover water on the moon
        - and let's think back to the question that we, we were asked
        - how can we bring STUDENT of that together, to then say what truly right what tool was used so that these astronauts could discover this water on the moon, what are your ideas
        - What equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yes, all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water STUDENT
        - When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have
        - If we now we went back to answer that question right what equipment did did did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - each of you individually, which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, and is Jazmin pointed out, oh sorry about STUDENT yes
        - So we just talked about how equipment and discover are two very important words but what I want you to do is identified the specific piece of equipment that they used
        - So, yes let's STUDENT read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment,
        - So, initially, I gave you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - I want us now to spend the same amount of time thinking about what the second half of the question is, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you're looking at the question we have what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - yeah what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - So here if we go back to the question, what kind of equipment scientists used to find water on the moon, so what is our answer?
        - At the question i'm going to read it if you could follow along what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon circle, the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - um so earlier today, you read about water on the moon, and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and you need to just circle, the evidence in the text
        - Well, in a lot of ways that's right Okay, because the question was what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What I have a question for you, what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,
        - Right Okay, so we have the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - so one more time, will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them
        - Find text evidence, just as you were doing in that first part of STUDENT to inform this answer
        - Okay, so where did they send this machine to
        - I I like what you gave me there Let me read the question, one more time and then I can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry STUDENT, yes
        - I was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as STUDENT
        - Alright, so Hello everyone and, as you all know, we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon, is a desert, and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so Hello again so right before lunch, we were talking about how, in this question, which I will read again quickly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So remember our question is asking about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so our plan for today is that I am going to give each of you STUDENT some time to read over your responses to the question that I had originally asked which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at the question again, it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - So the question is also asking um what equipment, do they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yes, in response to the question about what equipment was used to discover water
        - The first question, I saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we've got a new question that's is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be invaluable
        - yeah maybe we can glue STUDENT of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable
        - We are, but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,
        - and let's look at the question
        - The question is what equipment is scientists used to discover water on the moon, right?
        - STUDENT right, thank you alright so again, we have that question about what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - awesome so I noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and all of you had great responses, yes STUDENT
        - So y equals did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon
        - i'm in the craters so let's go back to the context of the question how what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        - Because we want to know what good scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - What equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - We've STUDENT read this article water on the moon from the New York Times, and now we're trying to answer this this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we've just read the article water on the moon by the New York Times, and now we're analyzing this second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
- intent: r530.1
  examples: |
        - Great job STUDENT, so how has your thinking changed, I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity
        - alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation
        - STUDENT So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning
        - What's another way you might answer that question
        - So can you see, um, you know, how we can approach that question a little differently now that you've kind of looked at it
        - How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking
        - Can you go back to that
        - About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking
        - Were you thinking about that a little differently
        - So what made you what, how did I change your answer
        - Okay, so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer
        - So how did you go about correcting your answer
        - Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be
        - Now that we've discussed it
        - So what kind of helped us find our answer
        - So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your think
        - How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently
        - OK, so now that I have given you STUDENT some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking
        - Then, how that changed
        - So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did
        - Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer
        - Can you help me figure out the why
        - So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning
        - So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change
        - STUDENT, has that change your thinking a little bit?
        - Alright so let's STUDENT think what did we learn about changing our answers today?
        - Do you see any ways does your mind kind of changing
        - Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your STUDENT
        - So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response
        - And now I think this way because And then you can tell me
        - So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what
        - So, reflect on that process what that was like
        - You started out thinking a certain way and now you think
        - So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process
        - I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank
        - So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now
        - Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you
        - Does STUDENT else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer
        - But now what they know is the right answer
        - Does STUDENT else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
        - Does STUDENT else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
        - Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers
        - Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so STUDENT what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have
        - Okay STUDENT, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change
        - yeah so I want you STUDENT to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future
        - So I would love to hear from Oliver Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you STUDENT just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can
        - Alright cool STUDENT so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response, a little bit more specific to what you read today
        - awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas
        - Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer what was different about those two
        - Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?
        - what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
        - mm hmm so let's just think about as a team like What did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? STUDENT
        - So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
        - OK so STUDENT do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking
        - Great so STUDENT now that you're participating already Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response
        - is there anything else did STUDENT do anything different when they were revising their answer
        - First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions
        - yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that
        - And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
        - mm hmm and has your thinking changed at STUDENT about how they found it
        - Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think
        - What was different about your first answer and your second you said
        - So how can I ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer what was what was different and how other than just writing more, what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer
        - How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think
        - Thank you okay so STUDENT do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions
        - Whatever you think it's Okay, if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you STUDENT are thinking so take a moment before our conversation I thought this after our conversation I thought this
        - Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, but just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think
        - has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this STUDENT sorry I saw your hand was up
- intent: r410.2
  examples: |
        - Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be
        - but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right
        - You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely
        - So STUDENT with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great
        - But when you tell me about the tool
        - What are we trying to do to the water, STUDENT
        - So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water
        - So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water
        - Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer
        - What small machine? What was it called?
        - You could have been looking at her paper
        - You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does
        - okay and in your answer
        - Does your answer tell what discovered the water?
        - but it's not quite the only thing that they used
        - There are a piece of equipment that they used
        - And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool
        - So scientists do use those type of things
        - Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific
        - So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer
        - I asked STUDENT over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text
        - It's answering a different question
        - But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us
        - So even though your answer is true
        - Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific
        - And that is very, very true, but it's not exactly phrased in the way that answers the question
        - Thinking back on what I just told STUDENT, does it answer the question that we are asking
        - Well, just because you need to have a deeper understanding doesn't mean your answers wrong just that you could probably put in a little more detail in your answer
        - And that's a it's an equipment, isn't it, but we look in the passage for a specific small machine and it tells us in the passage that there is a it gives us the name of the small machine
        - But it's not the specific machine
        - And STUDENT That you put scientists found is using a small machine so that small machine is correct that small machine could be any sort of tool
        - So all those facts are right that you STUDENT had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay
        - So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to STUDENT, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and
        - So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?
        - So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity
        - If we were more, a little more specific, I should say
        - But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding
        - So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically
        - And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at
        - but it's still wrong
        - We want to know about this equipment
        - The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but
        - If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space
        - They absolutely do
        - Yes, yes, they do
        - But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story
        - So we got to make sure that when we're answering
        - We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were
        - And that is really close to what we're looking for here
        - So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine
        - So, good job
        - Yes, so NASA did send a small machine
        - In this case, STUDENT was a little too vague
        - Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for
        - This is how you go about doing it
        - We're talking about NASA specifically right
        - We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon
        - We're talking about someone that's already done
        - But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific
        - but can I ask you another question about that
        - So is that convincing me that water would be valuable?
        - Okay, so that is true
        - That is something that we read in the story, but does it answer the questions about what they used
        - That's true, but we want to focus on the text
        - I think we just need some more to it
        - But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - Wow, that's very possible and STUDENT, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy
        - That is true
        - So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting STUDENT to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water
        - Does that make sense
        - But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too
        - You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon
        - Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space
        - I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water
        - I don't think the intention is for it to discover water
        - The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts
        - It's just a little bit incomplete
        - So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me
        - It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent
        - So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete
        - Because some of us are, you know, technically correct, but not not super correct like STUDENT over there said oxygen tanks
        - Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to The moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water
        - We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine
        - And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true
        - It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's
        - And could you discover water with that specific tool
        - Could you go into space
        - I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now
        - So my suggestion to STUDENT of you would be to maybe
        - So, back to you
        - Svannah and STUDENT the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water
        - I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we STUDENT could have answered the question better and more specific
        - But I do think water is valuable
        - So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment
        - Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that
        - But you focus on the article
        - But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon
        - Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that
        - It's really cool
        - They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable
        - So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with STUDENT, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it
        - So when we look at our key words and then our key words there in the passage
        - We know that it's got to be more than just that
        - Right, we would think that, but when we look at our key words from the text we got to remember, it's telling us the answers in the text
        - And we got to look for the specific answer
        - lets people know what you're talking about
        - Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter
        - We're not going to which question
        - It goes to
        - Master breathe with and they use different equipment for different task, but we needed to know specifically what they used to discover the Water Rat
        - Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter
        - They're not going to what we're talking about
        - What if we put
        - Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text
        - It didn't talk about that
        - So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is
        - Does that make sense
        - And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters
        - Yes, you need to be just a little more descriptive in your response
        - But once you add that little extra bit of adding the official name of what equipment was used, then you're going to be on the right track
        - but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that
        - answers the question better
        - but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely
        - It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it
        - I think you need to add a little bit more
        - So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph
        - When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things
        - Does that make sense
        - So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story
        - Does that make a little bit more sense
        - So their ships wouldn't have to carry it
        - Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it
        - So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon
        - So is it heavy
        - Uh, your answer is technically correct
        - The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter
        - Okay, STUDENT you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery
        - You just picked the wrong one
        - We're not talking about space, though
        - So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that
        - Well that's good that you know a lot about space
        - Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text
        - While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster
        - We want to see what they say
        - So we want
        - Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine
        - But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon
        - Do you understand that
        - So let's look at the question again
        - So your answer doesn't really relate to that question
        - But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes
        - I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that
        - So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space
        - So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics
        - Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?
        - oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you
        - STUDENT So it does talk about oxygen
        - But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment
        - So we know that one doesn't answer a question
        - So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water
        - But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen
        - But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool
        - That is correct
        - This scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - That is a tool that they use
        - Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yes, it should be a good answer there
        - But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out
        - Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on
        - But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out
        - I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water
        - It doesn't have enough water, but it hasn't not enough of something else that we have to have do me a favor
        - So, you missed one part of that because it works as a STUDENT
        - They don't really say that, is where Mr
        - STUDENT talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts
        - It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks, do they do use them
        - Yes, but not in this text
        - You just needed the name of the item that they used
        - um I it's not wrong it's just you can add a little bit you can add more to it and have it be a more complete dot not that isn't like a complete thought, but like
        - But yeah i'm so STUDENT had a good answer it could have been longer but
        - Your answer is not wrong but it's not correct, you said yes, they use a small machine and the Lunar orbit is a machine, but it was not as specific as I would have wanted to hear
        - Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it
        - I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope
        - And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,
        - And, as I talked, as I said, to STUDENT she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah
        - One part you were missing, though, is
        - So what were they looking at closely
        - What they were looking at
        - I really want to hear
        - I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as STUDENT
        - So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that STUDENT circle, the same one as you
        - But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know
        - But I want to hear more specific answers in that
        - What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like
        - I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading
        - STUDENT, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words,
        - I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as STUDENT
        - I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators so did you go and highlight two types of equipment
        - And Farrah had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth, I want to know what STUDENT found in the reading I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great
        - So your answer is right, but you will have -didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name
        - I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in STUDENT but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say
        - But I think what I was looking for is a little bit more information on
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA send a small machine which is completely correct
        - So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards
        - When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text
        - And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question
        - That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and STUDENT were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship
        - Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the
        - Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was
        - Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used
        - But we need to highlight the equipment
        - and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it
        - Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of
        - whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could
        - One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question
        - And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one
        - That is a really good answer
        - So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to STUDENT of our answers to make them a little bit stronger
        - but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see
        - But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?
        - That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because
        - And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving STUDENT um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question right like how Is that why water is valuable why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why
        - Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question
        - I just wanted to see where you found it
        - I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the STUDENT knows where to look
        - so your response says that they found craters full of water
        - But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters
        - When I heard your response
        - You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - You were a little vague
        - You just stated evidence
        - Okay, so STUDENT your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence
        - Because your answer could have gone either way
        - You could have said no
        - Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume
        - just like STUDENT he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree
        - And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as STUDENT, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer
        - In your answer it's very vague, so it just says a small machine
        - But I was hoping that maybe we could work on adding a little bit more detail to your writing because someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is right
        - But what has already been discovered on the moon
        - I'm concerned about your tense because you kind of address, you said you need a scientific tool
        - So when I was reading that I thought you were talking to me
        - I'm a little bit concerned STUDENT
        - It didn't really restate the question
        - I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer
        - So the way that you worded your answer
        - You just said I circled the same as savannas I it doesn't help me know if you understand the question, or the answer really um
        - I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything
        - So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail
        - But what made you say that, my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        - And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        - But you need a little more specific
        - Teacher : Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon
        - Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term
        - So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks
        - Teacher : But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks
        - Our question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine
        - Right, so you have the answer
        - It was more that we just need to build more on it
        - So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step
        - Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic
        - However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text
        - Does that make sense to you?
        - If you provided that information that you just told me, STUDENT, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question
        - However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer
        - And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used
        - When we provide information from our own background knowledge
        - The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information
        - So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response
        - And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right
        - but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules
        - The person who's reading your response
        - Don't know where you got that information right
        - You may question where you got that evidence
        - So if he was reading your response
        - However, maybe STUDENT doesn't know that
        - And if it's truly valid right
        - For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it
        - But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water
        - If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen
        - That is correct
        - Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details
        - But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so STUDENT
        - That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this
        - I really appreciate that point and you are correct
        - So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed
        - But there weren't any astronauts present
        - Question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and we need to answer that question using the article
        - There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer
        - STUDENT your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence
        - So you identify why water is valuable
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon
        - So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be
        - I'm concerned that that we need to find something a little bit more specific
        - And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for
        - STUDENT So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Yes, a new answer
        - So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail
        - Another the main equipment
        - I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer
        - What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you STUDENT found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think
        - but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take
        - yeah that's absolutely right, I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any
        - i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story
        - yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question
        - but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story
        - i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your
        - So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks
        - But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text
        - And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence
        - Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading
        - I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here
        - You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine
        - You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK
        - But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so
        - But we wanted to use the text
        - They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text
        - At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample
        - i'm concerned that your response doesn't include STUDENT of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts
        - But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery
        - In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon
        - because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component
        - If somehow you looked at STUDENT the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space
        - You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right
        - We look at the text that you have we want to see what equipment they talked about from the article so that may be true, on space exploration, that we do need
        - yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though
        - That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right
        - But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?
        - However, there was another machine you STUDENT that they also used
        - Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every STUDENT your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help
        - mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself
        - Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah STUDENT
        - So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question
        - So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question
        - Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly
        - i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today
        - well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so
        - And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts
        - and i'm concerned that the responses that you STUDENT chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking
        - I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess
        - But the question here is based on the text that we just read
        - So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time
        - Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small
        - But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but
        - But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was
        - So you STUDENT took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article
- intent: r430.2
  examples: |
        - Absolutely, and you are, you are, you are correct and, but when we're asking you in this question is to circle, the evidence, so we want you to draw your answer from something specifically that you read here
        - STUDENT was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use
        - But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that
        - so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words
        - so Farrah and STUDENT both circled microscope
        - that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely
        - STUDENT, you have a question
        - so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover
        - I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter M, if that's helpful
        - You can look back in your reading for that
        - I would love if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is
        - And STUDENT NASA send out a small machine
        - Well, they used a lunar orbiter
        - But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for
        - So a little more in depth
        - They did send a small machine, right, that is, but it was asking specifically
        - So could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment
        - What that piece of equipment's name was?
        - But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about
        - That's very good
        - So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct
        - So in the article
        - Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there
        - Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water
        - Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment
        - I think that we could even
        - So this is kind of for STUDENT of us here
        - Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters
        - I think he would be on a great, great track
        - And STUDENT might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there
        - If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question
        - So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that
        - You can use this to do that
        - Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well
        - Why don't we change the subject
        - Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water
        - We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water
        - So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close
        - Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a
        - So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine
        - I need to dig a little deeper
        - And what else does the passage
        - So with your answer
        - Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable
        - What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen
        - Does that make sense
        - So you want to say yes it's valuable because of STUDENT the things that you were saying
        - You guys are STUDENT close but you want to get an exact answer
        - So you want to expand your answer a little bit
        - So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage
        - It was a small machine, STUDENT
        - I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down
        - And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down
        - So that's the only thing I would add to your answer
        - and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used
        - Make sure you back things up, it takes like STUDENT Farrah, you know, like in your answer
        - You didn't really back it up
        - I want you to read that last paragraph for me, STUDENT
        - Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read
        - They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon
        - Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking
        - So, STUDENT and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track
        - But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer
        - Does that make sense
        - You, you just said I circled the same as STUDENT, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did
        - So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But there's, it's more descriptive
        - But what was the machine called and what did it do?
        - And you're right, it is a small machine
        - They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine
        - So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific
        - It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it
        - I like that you
        - To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you
        - So can you come up with a new way
        - However, if we were talking just about our reading passage
        - Those are not necessarily in there
        - It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer
        - A STUDENT, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote
        - Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's
        - So next time
        - Okay, so next time
        - Does that make sense
        - You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water
        - In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question
        - Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was was the name of that small machine small machine
        - but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific
        - That is an excellent point
        - Why would that be useful
        - So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence
        - So what is that next sentence say
        - But I want you to think about why that would be useful
        - Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And STUDENT What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen
        - So instead, let's focus on your opinion
        - So is there
        - So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific
        - So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question
        - You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid
        - What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine
        - We need to make that answer specific
        - So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question
        - So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - : Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question
        - So STUDENT you have right now is evidence
        - And then you explain that evidence
        - What was the name of the small machine that was used
        - And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you
        - So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer
        - What was your answer to that question
        - In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so STUDENT
        - Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself
        - Is it wrong
        - What was that small machine used for
        - Well, your, your answer
        - I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used
        - You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own
        - You just said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in Farrah's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it
        - Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon
        - Um, well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying, NASA send a small machine, but, um, you could have talked about what that machine was and how it But, um, yeah
        - So you weren't you weren't wrong
        - Oh, it's just, I'm a little too broad
        - um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks, you can maybe mentioned, like the soup thing where because that's also equipment, because they needed to be up there on
        - But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote
        - So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly
        - it's a wide range for an answer, so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay
        - was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA
        - You said I remember your response
        - We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text
        - But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific
        - Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you
        - I still want you to say an answer, because I want STUDENT to be giving an answer
        - And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer
        - Tool a microscope to look really closely
        - That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific
        - You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon
        - you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water, I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer
        - but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail
        - So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information
        - So, that's correct
        - But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon
        - So you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon, but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response, you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like Farrah and STUDENT added
        - However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that
        - My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and
        - so with  your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it
        - So we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text
        - Instead, your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading
        - but I would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text
        - Like for example, we know that NASA used the Rover to find water on the moon
        - Maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer
        - And we want to go a little bit further, we want to dig a little bit deeper
        - But we want to explore a little bit further
        - Ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read, could they learn that information from your answer
        - Your answer isn't wrong STUDENT
        - I want you to expand your answer
        - I want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine
        - Is that OK with you
        - So I want you to find your answer in the text because I want us to practice that skill
        - But I do want us to practice being that reading detective
        - Totally and and that's very helpful
        - Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer
        - I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence
        - It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer
        - And why can you tell me if this is good or bad, and why
        - I'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing
        - But my concern is, would you look carefully at the passage I think you have targeted the right place in the passage
        - You just need to be a little more specific
        - You want to use the text for our answers
        - We don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable
        - yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too, so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals
        - The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine
        - In this way, that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so
        - Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and
        - but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?
        - i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question
        - Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water
        - To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used
        - Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use
        - Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again
        - Yes, oh, you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions
        - So what i'm noticing in Farrah's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon
        - But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used
        - but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think
        - To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question
        - so STUDENT is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture
        - So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick
        - I am wondering if we could get more specific STUDENT right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this
        - And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay
        - You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text
        - So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be
        - STUDENT I loved your answer
        - I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is
- intent: r510.1
  examples: |
        - so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence
        - Absolutely that's great that is a great definition of what evidence is right when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question
        - so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use
        - All right, um STUDENT, can you explain to me what evidence is
        - But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us
        - Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers
        - We just needed to look more closely at our text
        - So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were STUDENT really close
        - It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for
        - Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question
        - It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say
        - So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question
        - More flow through this
        - The first time you scan it right
        - You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah
        - Does that make sense
        - And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again
        - So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question
        - But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking
        - Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer
        - You the strategy I talked about
        - Say, practice makes perfect
        - So if you want to be good at something, you keep john over and over and over
        - We found a key what
        - So remember when we looked at our question
        - You remember what I asked you to find
        - Keyword to help us and to answer the question
        - Did we need to answer this question
        - And what key word
        - It is so important
        - So always find and identify a keyword
        - So you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text
        - She used the passage that we provided to find her answer
        - I like how Jazmin was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and STUDENT that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond
        - Again, I like how she's very specific
        - She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text
        - Yes, so we look really closely at those key words in our question
        - So remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those key words, those words that we need to look for in our text
        - So remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words
        - And then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer
        - It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next
        - So often when we read it will tell us a sequence
        - So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
        - Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence
        - Well, what I do agree
        - What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something
        - When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on
        - So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name
        - So I think we've STUDENT kind of like learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
        - Does that make sense
        - We know we STUDENT know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given
        - Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper
        - So we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words
        - Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question
        - Who thinks that they they can explain to STUDENT What what keywords
        - Alright, so let's look back at our question
        - But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings
        - So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer
        - Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence
        - And then what happened
        - Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text
        - You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question
        - So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened
        - And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was
        - I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific
        - So we went
        - So, so you built off your answer
        - Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct
        - We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for
        - And this is what it was doing
        - And much like with STUDENT earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question
        - And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components
        - That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together
        - And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
        - So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
        - So I really like to do is the race format
        - What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking
        - So for example, when I read
        - So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank
        - And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment
        - Where are we using yes STUDENT
        - But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific,
        - So you can be give the best answer
        - So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords
        - See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
        - Yes, that is exactly what I would like
        - And that goes for everyone, not just STUDENT
        - So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading
        - great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer
        - What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question
        - Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water
        - So that was a really great response
        - So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well
        - You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why
        - What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using
        - There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before
        - So a lunar orbiter a microscope
        - yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions
        - Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning
        - That was a perfect or smart
        - It was very specific
        - So to find evidence
        - And she said, paragraph three, so we could STUDENT look at our texts and find where she was reading
        - We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that
        - And in our responses we want to use academic language
        - It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers to use
        - I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you
        - It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning
        - and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water
        - STUDENT, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking
        - You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable
        - If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay
        - So STUDENT, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer
        - So when we're answering comprehension questions like this
        - We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using STUDENT the information
        - I am going to give you some sentence starters and
        - This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies
        - So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question
        - So Farrah, and then you when you change your answer to what STUDENT also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        - She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon
        - Can You Do you remember
        - Can you restate what their strategy is
        - So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer
        - And you were able to find another part that you could add to it
        - Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing
        - and I think that that's an excellent strategy for STUDENT to think about when we're reading a text is to think
        - yeah Chris it's great STUDENT right i'm so glad that you have so much background
        - When you're trying to answer this question is just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph and then find us as they're seeing the paragraph here just located
        - When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
        - So that's a great process
        - So that's great that's a great segue
        - So what I wanted to ask you STUDENT, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically
        - So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important STUDENT, you have something to add
        - are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question STUDENT, what do you think
        - I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text so i'm
        - And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate STUDENT of those components
        - Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two
        - What i'm going to suggest to STUDENT of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
        - so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading
        - That can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it
        - We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers
        - STUDENT right, who's ready to start
        - yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists
        - Did STUDENT else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers
        - okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely
        - So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so
        - I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique
        - that's good yeah the thing about the thing about reading for keywords and sometimes authors will use synonyms so two words that mean the same thing, so when we're thinking about discovery definitely found or
        - yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
        - yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with STUDENT I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response
        - I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go
        - Fantastic so I really appreciate coming STUDENT just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here
        - The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response
        - I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text
        - so I think STUDENT you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two
        - yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy, you can use in response questions
        - Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so
        - But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text,
- intent: r410.1
  examples: |
        - But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - Absolutely and that's something that like STUDENT put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us
        - Also, STUDENT, your question or your answer
        - Had to do with equipment as well
        - But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main
        - It was the Lunar Orbiter
        - But that's not what the, um, that's not what
        - The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon
        - But I think you may be confused on the question,
        - And the question I think we need to be a little more specific
        - And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking
        - But the question is actually specifically pointing toward
        - And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it
        - What's the potential value
        - They weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space
        - So yes, you're right, they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that, because there is no oxygen in space, but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space
        - but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water
        - I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money
        - The question was, is water valueable
        - But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment
        - I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we STUDENT had
        - Because he answered, whether it was a good investment
        - So although you're, you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely, what it equip-- They're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it
        - But did they discover the water with the microscope?
        - So they use the microscope, microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water
        - but is the question asking is it right now
        - but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable
        - Not that they're ready
        - Would it be valuable to
        - But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically
        - So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together
        - What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment
        - But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so
        - And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that
        - It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water
        - But for this specific question
        - However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense
        - Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope
        - That's very good
        - It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking,
        - Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So when we look at yours, you don't necessarily answer the question i can i can tell what you're getting at by reading your evidence, but you don't actually specifically answer the question then provide evidence and then just explain it
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon
        - That's what the question was asked
        - It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples
        - If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar
        - Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up
        - Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect
        - You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question
        - That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used
        - we're talking about the equipment, so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment
        - yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked
        - Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water
        - But you didn't talk about the equipment
        - The question asked for you to talk about the equipment
        - This is for everybody, not just STUDENT, when you are talking about
        - So when you STUDENT are
        - So you STUDENT are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated
        - STUDENT you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking
        - So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking
        - Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so
        - Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear
        - We're looking at when they used to find the water
        - Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one, so, while they do use those equipment, that's not what we're looking for for this question
        - So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon
        - What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so
        - Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked
        - which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon
        - But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry
        - But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is
        - But, that doesn't truly answer the question
        - Alright STUDENT, so, when we look back at the question
        - While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that
        - So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,
        - That is true and it's basically just what I told STUDENT, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water
        - but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not STUDENT the other machines
        - To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water
        - but do you think that that's answering the question
        - part of the question do you think you're missing
        - Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question
        - Do you understand?
        - So your - STUDENT, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found
        - but in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water
        - And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you STUDENT, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon
        - Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use
        - But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-- is that a type of equipment?
        - The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically
        - We kind of need both
        - So although I really love your answer
        - And it did teach me something I do want you to answer the question
        - Yes, the water is an overload along a passage
        - The key words like equipment do agree
        - But my concern is other students and they circle
        - You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future
        - This is the next step after they discovered water for the morn, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one
        - However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly
        - The main question
        - So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us
        - So I'm going to give you STUDENT 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it
        - And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question
        - And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer
        - So I want to ask all of you STUDENT take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think: What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question
        - Can you tell me that
        - So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for
        - Are you able to tell me what the question is
        - But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text
        - Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us
        - The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts,
        - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon, so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using STUDENT, did you have a follow up about that
        - But another really important part of his question is the action
        - Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking
        - So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon
        - Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then STUDENT for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right
        - So they can be types of tools, yes, you know equipment gear STUDENT those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right
        - And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found
        - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it
        - I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon
        - i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water
- intent: r430.1

        - so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water
        - So in the text, you should be focusing on what would answer that specific question not not pre knowledge
        - So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water
        - You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question
        - So another suggestion is, once you have
        - And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon
        - They are using the microscope to look at the water
        - However, I like how STUDENT really looked at the question
        - That's a good place to start
        - So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question
        - Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions
        - What did they use to see the water
        - You did say a fair point
        - So you didn't quite answer the question there
        - So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use
        - Did they use
        - What type of equipment
        - What type of machines
        - But the question really was
        - And you've told me where on the moon
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The water was discovered
        - So what can you add to your thoughts to just make it a little bit stronger
        - Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment
        - Please read the question again do you have another key words like the action in the words in a sentence action word?
        - So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is
        - STUDENT right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly, it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically
        - To what the scientists use
        - So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once
        - What was the equipment that they use to find the water, so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water
        - The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time STUDENT what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements
        - My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment
        - Can you read locate the text and find the Oliverice that leads you lead the scientists to the water, I think that would make more sense with this particular question, but I think you did
- intent: r420.1
  examples: |
        - All right STUDENT I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question
        - Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it
        - I want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and I want you to find the most important word or the key word that you think is most important in this question
        - In the question what which which which most important word
        - Did you pick out in the question
        - A microscope is equipment
        - Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word
        - So right now, STUDENT to find action word and underline
        - That is a synonym for investigate
        - So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question
        - Find would be the same
        - So when we're answering questions we need to make sure we're answering the question that's being asked
        - Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see
        - Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that
        - If you look at what it should be
        - But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you
        - Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer
        - What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer
        - So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question
        - So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question
        - So again, let's look back at our question and look for two key words that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage
        - Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question
        - So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to STUDENT
        - I want you STUDENT to look at question number one
        - OK, so what I want us to do is just a minute
        - I want you STUDENT to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth
        - but I want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two key words that are important, that might help you answer the question
        - So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other
        - What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is
        - Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for
        - Once you reread that question
        - So, but let's look at the question again
        - So you get that information
        - As you're reading the test
        - You're the question is trying to answer so SCAM, IT LOOK AT THE QUESTION
        - And then read to answer the question
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence, I want you to go back and think deeper about the question
        - What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word
        - Okay, so what words, did we find in our text that helped us answer our question
        - There any words that we circled or underlined in our text
        - Is that I would read the questions first
        - Then I'd read the passage
        - So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions
        - but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering
        - And let's think about what key words
        - Do you hear when you are reading that question
        - So think about that on your own real quick and then we will discuss what keywords, we see
        - So let's think about that question together real quick
        - Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important
        - There's two words that are very important in this question
        - Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that
        - When you've circled your two key words
        - If you will just look up at me when you're finished
        - What do you think
        - Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words
        - 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words
        - What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover
        - Looks like we're finished
        - Um, so what do you STUDENT think what is another word for equipment
        - Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so
        - We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it
        - What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question
        - The two main action words
        - Or verbs in this question
        - So I'll give you about
        - And I want you to take your pencil and just circle
        - The two action words in the question
        - STUDENT right, so what I think we should do, after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question
        - That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text
        - So if STUDENT looked at that question
        - The first question I answered a
        - Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question
        - What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question
        - So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session
        - So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes
        - Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you
        - Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure
        - So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute, take some time and look back that question and circle that okay
        - This is confusing to me
        - Miss Teacher what about this word
        - What's to that to you about that question, something about it
        - Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about
        - First, I want you to look about that question
        - Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that STUDENT used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that
        - And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions
        - So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of Olivers and savannas answers
        - Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text
        - So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay
        - Is there STUDENT here because I want to make sure we understand the question
        - One question I want to ask, is there STUDENT here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means
        - STUDENT, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question
        - STUDENT right, is there anything we have here, right
        - There are some words that you weren't sure about
        - Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one
        - We need water to survive
        - So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you
        - Okay, well I'm very glad to hear
        - now STUDENT, what's your question?
        - But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give
        - By throwing in a little something that could be the answer
        - But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question
        - It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers
        - Does that make sense
        - We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response
        - But let's look back at the question that was proposed
        - So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer
        - Would STUDENT like to reread that for me
        - So does STUDENT have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for
        - At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question
        - Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words
        - Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to
        - I think you'll be able to better
        - You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense
        - And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely
        - plug it back in
        - Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question
        - and looking for the keywords in your question as well
        - And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question
        - That way we can answer the question
        - You STUDENT are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text
        - But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one
        - So take just a second
        - What were the key words
        - But what were, what was the keywords in number one
        - And your answer is closer to a correct answer
        - And I want you STUDENT to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key
        - Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question
        - So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question
        - But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how
        - So what keywords help us answer this question
        - About what words, can we underline in that question to help us answer the question
        - So just for a second here
        - Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it
        - What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence
        - So if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points of circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer
        - I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right
        - I have a timer going right now
        - I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that
        - yeah so Oliver and STUDENT that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response, so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that
        - you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future
        - But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely
        - So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text
        - when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer STUDENT parts of the question and that you're specific as possible
        - so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need
        - now before you share the answers with the STUDENT, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled
        - Can STUDENT do that?
        - I want to do that for one minute and then come back
        - So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important
        - My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used
        - yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment
        - What I suggest, what you STUDENT do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for
        - So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner
        - And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question
        - Where Am I find these words and the passage alright, so you have two minutes, with your partners
        - You two can start working on your second answer
        - When you go back, I want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves, what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text
        - It's looking for
        - Go back to the question and reread it, please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note Of what kind of answer
        - STUDENT, you identified the main idea of this passage
        - So I want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment, the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question
        - I did you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject
        - Identify what kind of answer the question is asking for
        - See if or reviewed your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text
        - It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do
        - And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion
        - OK, so now please look at the question again, you are going to find out to look keywords STUDENT the most important words in a question before you answer it
        - So I think you STUDENT understand what I'm saying
        - Thank you for your response
        - I saw Jazmin and STUDENT not nodding their head
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question
        - Please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the key STUDENT important words in a question before you answer it
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the keywords STUDENT the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important in a question, the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - And I want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important
        - I'll give you a minute to do that
        - Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for
        - Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question
        - Can you tell me what they want you to understand
        - So we want to make sure to understand the whole question
        - So we understand what they're asking us
        - And so just like I mentioned to Luis and STUDENT is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question
        - I think that's a great point, though, STUDENT is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us
        - So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence, who can give me the action word
        - So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question
        - But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, STUDENT
        - And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking
        - I would like for you STUDENT to think about that question
        - So What words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question
        - So when you know what's being asked of you, you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer
        - Is very important to know what is being asked
        - So going back to the question
        - Yes, once again, that's also very important
        - But when we answer questions we need to make sure we answer on what's being asked of us
        - And that's good information
        - But before we start to answer this question, I would like to dissect it with you STUDENT and figure out what are they asking us what is it that we need to look for an order to answer the question, you can
        - I would like for us to break down the question and figure out what are they act in us, because once we figure out what's what their accent us we can figure out How to answer the question in what's the answer the question with Oh is it convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence
        - Evidence is important and what's another important piece of this sentence, and upon part of the sentence that we need in order to answer the question specifically
        - So you said evidence
        - Thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - And I'm looking for one more piece of the sentence
        - One more piece of the question
        - What are some strategies that we can practice before we even answer the question, what are some strategies that we can practice to make sure we are answering the question that's being asked
        - So when reading the question, what are some
        - STUDENT for helping him out
        - And why should we look at the most important parts, someone can raise their hand or STUDENT
        - STUDENT for answering
        - When answering the question we want to look at important words they manage, do you have something else to say
        - That is very true
        - But in another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the key words in our question so i'd like STUDENT five of you actually to
        - and i'd like you to circle, the key words in our question our action words, the most important words in our texts in our question here, and once you have a key word, you can raise your hand
        - circle some keywords for me
        - tell me what this question is asking, or what this question is asking you to do
        - Let me know what this question is actually asking what what
        - So can you tell me where the main words of this question?
        - But first of STUDENT, I want you to pay attention to this question, hey, pay attention to all the words in the details
        - You know, like we have to pay attention to another key word that is in the question
        - So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question?
        - We have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for
        - But remember, in order to have an answer
        - Okay, so what are the main words of this question
        - And pay attention to these question
        - I want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is, and circle that okay?
        - STUDENT take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is
        - Did STUDENT take a second to pre read the question and circle the most important part
        - But it's important to look at the language of the question and say, oh, is this the is this, am I looking for an oxygen tank
        - Is that going to help them find water?
        - Now you can raise your hand, but I will wait 15 seconds to let STUDENT think
        - And identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text, you can use that word to think about to help you answer the prompt or the question, if you have an answer ready for me
        - I would like you some of the tools that help us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information and our reading is to look at the question in this and figure out what is it asking us
        - So I'd like you to take a minute
        - What you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for
        - Take your take your pencil and circle
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled
        - is really instead of going straight to the text let's really know that we understand the question so before we turn that to the text  let's Can someone tell me exactly what the question is asking what is it asking us to find
        - If we don't have a really solid understanding of what is being asked so with That said, what is the question asking us to find in the article that we read
        - yeah so a really good way to think about that, when we're reading Our question is it says, did they used to discover water on the moon, and you can look
        - So looking for keywords like that
        - So i'm going to give you STUDENT about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question
        - So, right now, I want you to identify the object that we're looking for from the question by circling equipment
        - underline the last part the scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - So I think the most important thing is you already got the most important on the equipment we're going to underline the equipment
        - and underline to discover water, the moon right
        - But let's look at the question again let's see what is the key word and the question are using that's really important STUDENT look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two key words that you think the question that's important and the question
        - So what do you think the most important words in that question are? What words are kind of giving us clues as to the answer that they want?
        - What other words, do you think it's going to help us to figure out exactly what the question is asking
        - and I can see one other word in that question that gives us a clue as to, or is going to help us figure out what we're looking
        - Yes, I will describe it to you so in with this particular question in order to make sure it's fully answered you want to make sure you're one answering the specific question that's being asked
        - Look for those little clues in the text in the question
        - Of the strategy that we just did with Question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for
        - Right, so if the question so sort of what we you know when you when you analyze things you read, we can look at specifically what the question is asking and
        - Like a treasure hunt right So what if you could take a second and circle, the words in the question that you'd be looking for STUDENT
        - so this leads us into a good activity where I want you STUDENT to reread the prompt and I want you to circle, the most important word in the process so just take a minute and go ahead and do that
        - and you're right, it is small, and they do need a microscope but my concern is that your response, need the piece of equipment that made the initial discovery right,
        - about what exactly the question is asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question
        - All right back to the question at hand, STUDENT I want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for
        - But one thing I want you to focus on at that you as well, because you to have pretty similar answers I want you to focus on the key action word, so we have that word discover right
        - cells to do that let's go ahead and look back at the first question, and what I want you to do this is like a really like he tip that would be super helpful and you could use later on to
        - So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it
        - So look back at the question and then I want you to read it and pick the most important word that will help us answer the question take 10 seconds and then we'll come back
        - So what I want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three key words and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that okay let's start
        - Can STUDENT circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it
        - To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question
        - what's the important word in the question
        - But actually i'd like us STUDENT to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself Read over the question and maybe circle some key words or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that
        - can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me, and maybe just two or three words, what is the question asking
        - Great that is completely correct and I want you to focus on two pieces of that question I want you to focus on that first word which is equipment and the second one, which is discover
        - Okay, so what According to scientists use discover discover water on the moon so what's an important part of that question that we need to what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about
        - so you can follow that thread to the correct response
        - So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question
        - STUDENT, you have a question?
        - cool so going back to our question like Luis said what are some key words or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question, what are we looking for, and the question does STUDENT know
        - Nice cool cool good good so with that you know what we're looking for with the equipment can we break that down a little bit more what are some words or some key words that we can relate to equipment that will help us find
- intent: r210.1
  examples: |
        - An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water
        - Okay, do you want to share your answer with us
        - Right to help them survive
        - Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right
        - Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate
        - Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?
        - Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy
        - Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time
        - I can't really can't carry
        - They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the
        - Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful
        - Yeah, they used to go home
        - Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how
        - But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence
        - But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope
        - What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter
        - So your answer actually would be correct
        - But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters
        - You would need a microscope
        - But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live
        - And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen
        - And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things
        - Yeah, that that was a very good answer
        - You've probably heard water STUDENT through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen
        - So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen
        - Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen
        - And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe
        - And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things
        - For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it
        - Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have
        - Okay, they do use that in space
        - But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water
        - So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water
        - Find, is a perfect word
        - So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time
        - To address STUDENT question, I would just like to clarify
        - So when we talk about NASA here were first of STUDENT two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here
        - So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground
        - Water on the moon be valuable
        - Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this
        - Each each Oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks
        - The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that STUDENT the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for
        - But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?
        - Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space
        - Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it
        - You could just say a rug
        - You STUDENT have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them
        - Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house
        - Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that STUDENT as well
        - Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter
        - I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but
        - on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how
        - So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it
        - So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment
        - So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable
        - This is a a question that asked for your opinion
        - So, people might have different opinions, but STUDENT opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text
        - Some of us for STUDENT going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions
        - That's okay if you disagree with each other
        - So we might disagree with each other
        - Does STUDENT know what a partial answer means?
        - Okay, so I put all of us into this group because STUDENT here has a partial answer
        - Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water
        - I was like, Well, I thought about this STUDENT night
        - that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA
        - I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have STUDENT these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph
        - Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well
        - And that is absolutely true scientists do use STUDENT those kinds of equipment
        - You need different tools for different tasks right? STUDENT
        - But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans
        - So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?
        - yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA
        - That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,
        - and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there
        - So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water STUDENT and you find something yeah okay
        - Yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while
        - yeah absolutely so that's why, in this particular response you don't have to include oxygen tanks
        - And that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water, so your answer wasn't wrong you STUDENT had similar answers, but I just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers
- intent: r120.1
  examples: |
        - Do you think you know it
        - So look back at your answer
        - Is that STUDENT that they used?
        - STUDENT look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle
        - You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer
        - STUDENT Let's talk about your answer
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool
        - Did they have to use
        - Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate
        - Did you find that answer in there?
        - So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - STUDENT, what else do you think?
        - Can you gues do that?
        - So Farrah and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and STUDENT I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used
        - How do we answer this question
        - What was your response?
        - So STUDENT our science expert, out of paragraph two
        - So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - How about you and Jazmin kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you STUDENT can help each other, look at the text
        - Let's discuss your answer real quick
        - The paragraph number
        - Read again number three
        - Okay, do you have something to add to Farrah's answer
        - STUDENT, you want to add something?
        - What do you think this STUDENT?
        - Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon
        - But what did they use to find actually water on the moon
        - But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon
        - What do you think that should be a good answer to that question
        - Yes, that is an answer
        - Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over
        - Would you like more time?
        - What is the question actually ask us
        - How would you answer that question
        - Would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer?
        - Do you remember what that was, or maybe where you could look to find that answer
        - So we can go ahead and go back
        - I'll look at that and if you give me a minute to this kind of pull it up
        - Is there anything you want to maybe add to that
        - But I want us to go back and look at that again
        - To see if there is convincing evidence because
        - I want you to go back to the section that talks about water as a valuable resource and see if you can come up with a different answer
        - And so let's look back and see
        - So, STUDENT and Oliveron
        - but let's see, can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing
        - Can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon
        - Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - and see if you can figure out some other evidence that water would be valuable on the moon
        - So, Luis, and STUDENT
        - You guys have been working together and STUDENT, are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence?
        - But how did they discover water on the moon, what things did they need to find the water
        - Did they use to find that water
        - What do you STUDENT think about that
        - I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it
        - So look back in paragraph 3
        - So STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - But what else did you need to know?
        - Back at the sin to me
        - Go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for
        - Do you think it would
        - So re rethink about that
        - Did you find any more information
        - Allright STUDENT while you were reading
        - Figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better
        - and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it
        - All right, STUDENT, um, what was, what was your response
        - but what what kind of equipment do they use to discover water
        - You can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers,
        - Okay, well let's um let's remember kind of what we read
        - But what did they use on the moon to discover water
        - Do you know what that that tool was called
        - So, Oliveron STUDENT
        - What was the tool that they used on the moon
        - Does STUDENT have an idea
        - Perhaps, um, does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs
        - Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment
        - Um, what is the question asking us
        - Can you just tell me what that question means
        - So on there, you can make that on so again
        - Raise your hand when you find find an answer
        - So what's another word
        - STUDENT, what is the second heading
        - STUDENT taken another second
        - I'll give you a few more seconds to look back over the text
        - Yes, let's go back and look
        - What did you get out of the question
        - What did you use to discover the water on the moon, though
        - So does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used To find water on the moon
        - Okay, do you have another answer at this time, do you think
        - So we needed to decide about looking back into our  text there and try to underline or find evidence that tells us about the small machine or the equipment that scientists use
        - Is there any other equipment that we need
        - What other instruments do we, we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it
        - Was there anything else in the text
        - STUDENT I want you to keep thinking and Miss to
        - I want you to think about the microscope again because I really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something I can't see
        - You might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that, to get those microscopic images?
        - and I have your answers so STUDENT, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - Did you see any other tools that you may need
        - Alright, so lunar orbiter and a microscope, can we find any other tools that scientists use? Think that's it
        - but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon
        - Alright, so, from what I read what other
        - item that they need on the moon
        - Alright so STUDENT Can you help me out after reading the story again
        - Make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for, so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon, is there, another tool, you can think of that the scientists used from the text
        - Can you find a different one?
        - That wasn't STUDENT or Luis's answer?
        - So for you, I just want you to totally um scrap the answer and we're just going to start fresh and new and we're going to improve and build, so I want you to reread the question
        - STUDENT what's up it's your turn
        - it's almost there you're almost there, but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage, because there is more information that you can use to include
        - So STUDENT, do you want to try?
        - So I want someone else to answer my question again
        - Previously, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? And I want someone to revise their answer from last time
        - Maybe STUDENT, do you want to try it? Farrah, do you want to try
        - Does anyone else want to try the question again besides STUDENT? That thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time
        - So what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon?
        - that's perfect I mean now you have three different types of equipment, so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay
        - Give you time to think about it
        - Okay, I'll call on you in a second
        - So can we go and look right back and just quickly, maybe skim the page and see if we could see any new equipment that was found
        - That's right, but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon?
        - Did NASA use so do you think you want to like change your answer, or maybe add something after what you just said that might make your answer a little bit stronger
        - so maybe just for answering that question um can we like think of
        - An answer for that
        - How about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed
        - Is there anything else that you want to add to that, or is it just that
        - And that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me?
        - Good so when you go and you look through the text, I want you to just let me know what your answers are directly okay
        - Can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used To discover water on the moon
        - Right, it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully
        - Well that's, well, that's great
        - So, STUDENT, what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about?
        - Oh, you know what else?
        - And then I want STUDENT to know if they want to change their answer
        - So well I check in with STUDENT
        - Do you think that you could work on that a little bit
        - I think that we should STUDENT go back in our text to skim for more detail to see if there's more than just the microscope that scientists use
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - When I say go, I want you to STUDENT reread the text and see if you can find more detail that answers the question
        - So maybe you can look at the text closely and find the answer
        - Yeah, so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer
        - Next, though there was another piece of equipment that was talked about survey
        - STUDENT I would like you to go back in the text and see if you can find a better answer
        - What did we learn
        - So after reading that statement
        - You can, did you want to give that a try
        - Alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text
        - I see some few shaking their head
        - And see if you can find something different
        - Please raise your hand and let me know
        - We'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used
        - And when you get to that part
        - What do we think they used
        - I would love if you could do the same for paragraph one and paragraph two,
        - So I'm going to give you a moment to reread the text and then I'd like you to give me a thumbs up or raise your hand when you're ready to share
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text
        - Can you remember what was that?
        - So how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out
        - So how about you look back into the passage and see if you can find any more information in any more research
        - So I wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer
        - So now I suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that
        - Are you able to do that for me
        - If we look in paragraph two, can do you see any other name of a machine
        - let's look a little bit earlier in the text and see if they use anything else to to find the water
        - um do you Luis or any of our other friends, do you STUDENT know where can you guys look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about
        - Yes, um what What about the paragraph that or the sentence that STUDENT helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the Lunar that the Scientists are using
        - so I wonder if we could expand our thinking a little bit more about that process of discovering the water
        - You can look at, yes I would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure
        - You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something
        - Okay, so what I want STUDENT to do now, I want you to revisit the text and find the place in the story that tells us the type of tool that was used to find water on the moon
        - STUDENT, can you add on
        - so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us
        - Is there is there any other equipment, you know off the top of your head that they use
        - Okay just humor me just a minute I want you to take one minute I want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down
        - Of the question so look back at the text to fill in that gap that you had missing, you have a really great start
        - So did you have any other thoughts about it, if we just look at this paragraph, especially the second sentence
        - So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water
        - Do you want to try to think about what else they could use?
        - but um let's let's keep building on that right good STUDENT
        - Good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph STUDENT do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer
- intent: r130.3
  examples: |
        - What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So, to make our answer better
        - We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Okay then not full of water
        - Once they found it
        - So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it
        - You had to use a microscope
        - You can't even see it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny
        - But they didn't use it to discover the water
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose
        - The microscope is used for a different purpose
        - They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon
        - But STUDENT of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose
        - We're trying to figure out which
        - That makes sense
        - Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon
        - So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so can we STUDENT agree that water is a valuable resource
        - It would take a long time
        - But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as STUDENT, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So that should have been your answer
        - They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful
        - Well, they didn't send a microscope
        - They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right
        - They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon
        - And see the surface of the moon
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - equipment that they used
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry
        - Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it
        - They had to use a microscope
        - Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope
        - So we were looking for
        - They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They sent the lunar orbiter up
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that
        - So instead, it it checked for water on the moon
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon
        - And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope
        - Things like the microscope
        - Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean
        - And the Lunar Orbiter
        - We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things
        - OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - and the ice deposits
        - That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        - They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things
        - So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water
        - So first they had to find it
        - And then they could investigate using the microscope
        - But as they were as time goes on It could be
        - I think that it could be valuable
        - Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet
        - So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future
        - It can be valuable
        - Does that make sense
        - So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one
        - That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water
        - And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water
        - So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they used to see the ice deposits
        - Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off
        - So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow
        - So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - looks for ice deposits
        - And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had
        - But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon
        - And that was the orbit
        - NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin
        - It's am from our end
        - I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage
        - They talk about NASA as STUDENT was talking, they do send a small machine
        - Okay, but in the top of the reading
        - And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which Farrah brought up and STUDENT
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they helped find water
        - Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink
        - So that's a valuable way that we could use water now
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water
        - That isn't what they used to discover it
        - They sent a machine up there
        - Um, I don't think so
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen
        - So you might have circled water as well
        - So they didn't technically need to use their oxygen, oxygen tank to discover the water
        - But like you said they did find water, but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text, but specifically to find the water they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment, called the Lunar Orbiter
        - The implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter
        - So even though we're not using the water right now
        - So in this case, they didn't
        - It doesn't look like they said they actually use a microscope
        - But there's other ways to detect it
        - but they use a different tool on the moon to discover
        - When they use the microscope, that wasn't to discover the water, that wasn't to find the water on the moon
        - But that's not the tool that they use to find it for the very first time
        - That's when you get on the moon and you you have to use that microscope to look really closely
        - And so once they discovered the water on the moon, then the scientists can use the microscope to look at it really closely
        - And so what that lunar orbiter does, that's the small machine, STUDENT, that they sent and the small machine, you were talking about is called the Lunar Orbiter
        - Within the second paragraph, it talks about NASA would send, a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - but oftentimes when we're asked a question, we Want to come to the best answer, we can possibly give or the most clear and simplest answer, which in this case, STUDENT was just saying it is in paragraph two, but like you said, you said you went on a trip to NASA with your father
        - So when we write our answer
        - We would, we would say
        - What does it do was
        - they're looking for
        - It's not capitalized like your name, Jazmin's capitalized, STUDENT is not is capitalized, but lunar orbiter is not
        - But when it says, called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer
        - And that is the name
        - So in the text
        - It said, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - The correct answer is Masterson a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, because that is this specific piece of equipment that scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - But however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits
        - However, I think that they have a plan for the water
        - and based off the paragraphs as STUDENT said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons
        - So they use that small machine and the small machine was called a lunar orbiter said the lunar orbiter was the small machine or the piece of equipment that the scientists use
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - The small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate
        - It doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope
        - What does, it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely
        - Well, again, it says that NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So, I do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine
        - It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use
        - I don't really think they could have
        - So now what I want you to do, you STUDENT know what elbow partners are?
        - But if we were to choose one answer to be correct
        - However, they use the Lunar Orbiter to actually physically get there
        - I would probably go with the lunar orbit
        - That gives us a path to answer Lunar Orbiter, because that is what the scientists use to discover it
        - And since we're looking at the question when it says discover the water on the moon
        - we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        - So that's where you found about the microscope
        - I bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there
        - Maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks?
        - So if they could just pick it up on the moon, then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something
        - You would need a microscope to look really closely at the water that they found on the moon, but that's not actually what these scientists use to find the water
        - However, the scientists actually used the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - If one of us went into space and we wanted to look at the moon water we would need a microscope
        - Right, so in that sentence, we can see that the text is using the Lunar orbiter as the tool that is actually finding the water
        - But I want you to go a little bit further and be able to say that the microscope would be needed to see the water, but the Lunar orbiter is what found the water
        - Like STUDENT, though, I want to push you a little bit further, and while I do like that answer, and I think you could keep that I would want you to add on to it and talk a little bit about the Lunar orbiter
        - Because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately, the question wants you to pick out of the text, yes STUDENT
        - yeah you're right i'm Sorry, I think, I said that in a bit of a confusing way, so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon, and the machine that they used to find these craters was the Lunar orbiter
        - But the last passage has our answer in it
        - Do you, you could mention um what equipment they use to find the water I think if i'm i'm pretty sure is a lunar orbiter that wasn't one that found the crators
        - yeah i'll i'll read it for you ready i'm ready okay NASA sang songs a equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which its purpose
        - is to travel around the moon and discover
        - So we could say, for an example, we could talk about the microscope, because they used it to see the water you can talk about the lunar orbiter that NASA sent
        - Those are some options
        - That is, that is correct
        - So the reason why we did this was because people were thinking, the microscope is what we were using to find the water, but in reality it was because we're using the small machine, the Lunar orbiter to find water
        - Does STUDENT have any questions about that?
        - but we can add a little bit more so, we could say NASA send a small machine called a what does STUDENT know what that what it's called that they sign
        - So yeah, you're right
        - They did send a small machine, but just so STUDENT knows the small machine that NASA son was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Yeah, so the lunar orbiter was small machine that was sent from NASA to help discover the craters on the moon
        - So there's actually two answers
        - So that's another tool
        - So if we look in the reading
        - We can even see that that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And now we understand that we're going to need a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - A small machine called the Lunar Orbiter, so that's that's so STUDENT you need to add is what other machines that they needed to use
        - is actually called a microscope
        - And that's what actually finds the water
        - yeah if you just take another look maybe at the second paragraph, the first sentence says a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment, but the Lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water
        - when we look back at the reading it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter, and the Lunar orbiter looked in the craters to find the water
        - that's perfect that's the perfect question, that is what we're trying to find the answer to, and if you STUDENT look back, you'll see that it says the Lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water
        - So if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the Lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could, and that would be right, but I think just saying the Lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too
        - um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes STUDENT
        - but the name of the small machine was the Lunar orbiter
        - or microscopes when looking for the water
        - When you went to look for the water, to discover on the moon, the equipment used was the lunar orbiter
        - And then the name for it-- it's lunar orbiter
        - So it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture
        - But they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter
        - Oliveron? I mean STUDENT, sorry
        - And this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon, it was like a microscope
        - So that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening
        - So like you, STUDENT
        - But if we use the tool of rereading the text, we would have seen that there was a name for it, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        - You explained that they sent a small machine
        - It's a Lunar Orbiter
        - But they are tools that you use to help you acclimate to the moon in the gravity
        - And you're absolutely right, the small machine is what they used to find the water on the moon it's called a lunar orbiter
        - Even though lunar orbiter is, which is what the scientists used to investigate the craters are could possibly have microscopes to give scientists, a closer look
        - What we want to actually
        - Think of in our answer is the actual equipment that's being used, which is the Lunar Orbiter and that helps us if you look in the text, it looks for ice deposits in large craters
        - Do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon, yes STUDENT?
        - So what I thought would be the answer I was answering it would be the Lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water, so I thought it would be both
        - And they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome,
        - There's two different equipment that they use to see the water on the moon
        - So first they found it with a lunar orbiter right?
        - Now they're now after they found it, what are they going to use to see the water on the moon
        - that's Okay, so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate
        - You know, we can be concise and still state the machine that they sent up to the moon was the Lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine next time you can write NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to the moon instead
        - and on paragraph two, you can look closely and see it was like a lunar orbiter that was used to investigate and find the water,
        - so when you're answering you could say in paragraph two, I saw that I found a lunar lunar orbiter
        - Right, so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon, how can we re re answer this question?
        - we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter
        - But it's just not the type of equipment that they used to find the water
        - So a microscope is a piece of equipment
        - So a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water
        - Right, there were two
        - But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use
        - Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer
        - So astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets, oxygen to breathe, obviously the water to drink
        - it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and that is the specific machine they use to discover the water
        - They use STUDENT that equipment to to just be able to be on the moon in general
        - So that was helpful for them to be able to be there
        - And then the lunar orbiter was something that they specifically used to Discover that water
        - The lunar orbiter is what they use to get through that hard exterior to find the water
        - So that's STUDENT you would have to add to your answers, just that you can have more of its supply to you so they can drink it
        - Teacher : Um, but it's a small machine that's called Old Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - But we also need Jazmin's part of the answer that
        - How did they even get the water down here
        - They needed that a lunar orbiter to see it
        - So we're going to begin by step one mentioning the Lunar Orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes STUDENT
        - Look, examining the water molecules, the lunar orbiter is what found them
        - So even though this astronauts went up there
        - They also use the machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - You just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope
        - Yeah, so I see I'm looking at the text to and I in our texts that it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - But with this specific question the answer that
        - is correct, is, is the Lunar Orbiter
        - That was the specific source of equipment that was used to determine that there was water
        - The right answer is the lunar orbiter because it is what NASA sent on to investigate the water on the moon
        - It the lunar orbiter is the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon
        - So that should have been the answer that we wrote down
        - But I just wanted to go over that specific question with STUDENT of you today so that you can realize that the equipment that they use to discover though that water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - The lunar orbiter is what was used to investigate into find that water and know it gets a little confusing
        - The correct answer is a lunar orbiter
        - But the first the first equipment that they sent discovered is water was the lunar arbiter
        - The Lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, they have to use like the first step to discover water was it the this mall machine
        - But the thing that we're really looking forward to the Lunar Orbiter
        - awesome Thank you so much so that kind of shows you that the machine that they were using is called the Lunar orbiter kind of describes what it does
        - you know because they probably couldn't have done it just with the Lunar orbiter so they needed the microscope as well
        - Yeah, yeah so there's two, so I think it could be seen, like the Lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture
        - and the Lunar orbiter could be seen as the bigger picture, so the Lunar orbiter they're both the pieces of equipment that the scientists use to look for water
        - so that's why you know the Lunar orbiter and the microscope were kind of the more accurate answer to the question
        - We actually do have water and craters here on earth
        - they put the microsope
        - it's not the machine but the microscope, they use to find a water
        - And then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water
        - Okay um that's good they found the water, but how much I don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water
        - Yes, yeah it's true when you go swimming you go, you have to go through in the deep water, so that you know you have fun, but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not  in the deep water they went to the
        - Oh yeah but I don't think they This time they sended those kinda equipment equipment, because on the moon, they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches, but not this time I don't think
        - yeah scientists found the evidence, but scientists found the evidence, but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and  then found the thing right
        - They went sent the machine to put the moon and , then they found some water right, yes, STUDENT
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way I know STUDENT I need to know
        - Because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water
        - yeah so that will be the answer
        - Exactly awesome the reason why the answer is not a microscope because they actually water that they found they actually use the machine to find actually find a machine they use a lunar orbiter
        - so the answer was actually lunar orbiter from a pay a paragraph two
        - uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three
        - the scientists in this paragraph, according to the text, they use a lunar orbiter from according to paragraph two that's a small machine and that's called lunar orbiter to find water under surface
        - So the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up, if you agree with
        - so they first use the Lunar orbiter like we talked about, and they also use the microscope to see the tiny particles of water
        - If if they had it already, but in terms of actually finding it the first time, I think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea,
        - But the article, at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the Lunar the Lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second STUDENT I wanted to talk about Luis's note Luis's answer on the oxygen tanks
        - The lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery, can you see that now, and the response
        - they sent up a satellite with this orbiter that orbits the moon to analyze that hydrogen that they had found right
        - they have a satellite go up right to do STUDENT of this
        - Investigators is the same thing as discover right,
        - The lunar orbiter right
        - about the microscope both of those two tools together would be exactly what they used to discover water on the moon
        - Because they sure did, however, the scientist needed a tool to help them and it's a small machine discussed in paragraph two of the text okay
        - fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah STUDENT
        - yeah but um I if we're looking at this question in particular right, we do need to focus on  that the lunar orbiter helped them to investigate where the water was
        - Well, I think you're right that they did use a small machine but they're also giving us this specific vocabulary, that the machine is called a lunar orbiter
        - they sent a specific one called the lunar orbiter
        - The surface of the moon is not like the pool it's maybe more like the soil or a farmland, so when you buried the water deep under under the surface it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a huge amount of water
        - you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters, but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water, instead of full of water,
        - so the craters are not full of water, they contains water yeah
        - um it's true that create crater is a big, but the water molecules they found is microscopic
        - so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text
        - So for you to
        - Well, it could be, both because you need the Lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios, but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for
        - So you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the Lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely STUDENT
        - Exactly, and they were like the small ice deposits in the large polar crater
        - That was just something that was on the moon
        - So now, you know, two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article
        - into your own little you put your little twist on it, which was good, but it does say in the text that you can use the water so would be valuable
        - No, so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in
        - I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well
        - yeah yeah definitely on the right track, hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the Lunar orbiter
        - There we go yeah good job, so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit
        - And um I also noticed, you know STUDENT like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the Lunar orbiter is what we use to find
        - That is the tool that we use the Lunar orbiter not a microscope

        - Okay, so whenever we're reading We want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question
        - So as we're reading, if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking
        - You can use that strategy over and over for the rest of your life
        - To STUDENT future questions in the text
        - What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
        - So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question
        - And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do
        - And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us
        - So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific,
        - So now that you've figured out the full answer
        - What will you do next time to when you're looking back in the text
        - Alright so next time
        - Go back and look in the story to find your answer
        - so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better
        - And how you will apply what you learned in your next task so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you STUDENT a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering
        - So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second STUDENT, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question
        - we're just going to go around STUDENT, what do you think first you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task
        - And last but not least, STUDENT What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
        - So next time you answer a question like that
        - What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using,
        - Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at STUDENT, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge
        - Right that's good that's why we're in school right because we don't know everything I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write
        - Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are STUDENT the way there yet
        - So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information
        - Right, so you went back and read
        - What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
        - I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this
        - I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook
        - And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future
        - So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use STUDENT of the evidence from the text all the information there
        - So next time we have, we're answering
        - Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do
        - Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text
        - What are you going to do that
        - And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy
        - You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence
        - Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay
        - Specific name and of the things that you described okay
        - Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question
        - We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion
        - or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these
        - Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question
        - And what about that, and when you STUDENT are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?
        - So what do you think you would do next time to
        - What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?
        - what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text so here i'm going to give you a new question if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question you ready?
        - How, what did you learn right What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this person
        - Great Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine
        - So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers
        - Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
        - Okay, what could you do next time
        - What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
        - Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said
        - How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down
        - Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question
        - Hi Welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it i'm STUDENT as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, yes, Ehtan
        - So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and
        - So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text
- intent: r430.3
  examples: |
        - Okay, so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph
        - So let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question
        - Does that make sense
        - Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon
        - So instead of oxygen tanks
        - Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment
        - See ifyou can find equipment that helped scientist, the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water
        - That's a key word in the question is equipment
        - This time, can you also look and see if you can find the equipment
        - Does that make sense?
        - Okay, so you are right NASA did send a small machine, but instead of looking for the machine
        - So we're looking
        - Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon
        - Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment
        - The same thing applies for yours
        - Okay, so they did that is true, they did find water on the moon, but now
        - And you using context clues to find that exact name for that equipment
        - But they also had to use the more specific tool to look at the water itself
        - So yeah, you guys STUDENT had similar good answers, but you wanted to dig a little deeper to find the exact answer
        - But that's not what they used to discover it
        - Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon
        - Can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water
        - Can you go ahead and look there and give me a response
        - I just want to make sure we understand
        - So maybe in the future use that information
        - But just make sure inside of whatever given takes that you have that you take it, maybe a little bit slower find STUDENT the information there and and then apply that
        - So what it's asking
        - But not necessarily applicable to this specific text
        - I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher
        - It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time
        - question if you're confused and look closely at the passage
        - If you look at what the positives are it might outweigh the time that it takes, so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon  so STUDENT can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon
        - But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon, if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used
        - So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks
        - But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question
        - So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also
        - But I do not believe that was in the article itself
        - So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior
        - I want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for that specific answer that you need
        - But I am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text
        - Do you want to try that
        - I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words
        - What I'd like you to do, though, is look a little bit closer in the reading
        - I want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that shows what tools they use
        - So as you're reading and you're making those real world connections
        - So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon?
        - I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water
        - How they would get to the water on the moon
        - So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon, why it's so important to use STUDENT that time and effort and money to get to the water
        - But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right, and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water
        - But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text
        - But you want to base your answer off of the reading you don't want to go off on your own path, just in case it isn't right now, you might have thought it was one thing, but it's not actually what it is, so you want to face what you see in the reading and then put that into your answer
