        - So let's think about before we actually look at water with the microscope what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water they found on the moon, so they use the microscope after they had found it, but what did they use to find it Do you remember
        - Do you remember what they called that machine science has STUDENT sorts of wacky names for their machines so that's what we're looking for we're looking to see if we can find The name of what that small machine was. Do you remember?
        - yep totally yeah look at the text look back, I think it's close to that same line about the small machine i'm not sure, but let us know
        - Farrah and STUDENT are you ready to come back to us with an answer, or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first
        - I yeah totally um so the microscope if you look at the are three sentences Here are three paragraphs In paragraph three, it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you would need a scientific cool tool called a microscope to look really closely so there's the part with the microscope but, if we go before then. We see where you found it called the Lunar orbiter and paragraph two right?
        - It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense
        - Hello um I think these are STUDENT really great starting answers, and I just want us to really work on looking at this text, a little more, so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so Can I get a yes
        - I think we STUDENT have different strengths here and I just want us to really practice not just like knowing the content but also being able to use the skill of backing our responses up with text with evidence from the text
        - Like where where they found their answer in the texts, yes STUDENT
        - So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome
        - i'm glad you brought this up, because I was just about to ask what other answers people had, so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer
        - yeah and what does the machine call
        - tiny water well can, yes I love that, so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located in
        - And what form so so, is it like we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't
        - yeah so definitely a lot of different equipment and even in this reading right we've already identified two different
        - Okay, I think, part of what we're doing right now is this isn't just about our knowledge of what we're learning we're going to think about the evidence we're looking for in that text to OK, so the background knowledge is going to be great and it's going to help us To understand a little bit what we're reading, but we specifically also want to look for evidence right
        - What equipment, did they use okay so i'm i'm looking for a name to what's the name of the small machine and he came
        - So Okay, we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - That is yeah and I think there, we can see, even in this very short text that we see two different pieces of equipment mentioned right we sad the lunar orbiter and we're seeing this thing about a microscope so even just in a few sentences we're seeing multiple pieces of equipment, but how do we decide which one is the answer to this question right
        - did they did this third paragraph tell us that the scientist used the microscope to find the water
        - but do we know for sure, does the paragraph tell us that they they had to does it say the scientists used one
        - yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it
        - STUDENT why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said
        - awesome STUDENT and which piece of equipment, do you think is the most important here.
        - All right, STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer what made you say NASA sent a small machine
        - would be, can you tell me more about this small machine does
        - awesome so this little machine it lands on the moon
        - awesome so STUDENT how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information
        - So Farrah and STUDENT, you said you will have the same answer, so why don't we work together
        - and STUDENT i'll be with you in just a second
        - STUDENT, can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did
        - So STUDENT can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story, what does it say
        - Okay, and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope STUDENT
        - Okay, so Oliver you had the same answer is STUDENT, can you tell me why you put that answer as well
        - yeah so Chris you're right Those are STUDENT great examples of equipment, so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, can you tell me more about that answer
        - All right, hi everyone welcome, so thank you so much for those answers STUDENT, I want to start with your answer so Chris, can you tell me more about what made you say your answer
        - Did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment STUDENT Chris does your answer mentioned equipment
        - yeah, so why don't you tell me more about your answer, let me just say your answer
        - We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all STUDENT
        - Farrah and STUDENT you had the same answer so Dave i'm going to ask you to start Oliver what made you say your answer
        - say more, why is it the answer to the question STUDENT
        - STUDENT was your reasoning similar to Olivers for why you said this answer was it different
        - My question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon
        - yeah that's right it doesn't really say that the scientists are using that
        - Oh okay STUDENT You said something like that didn't you
        - yeah so STUDENT can you say more about where you found that in the text, or why you said that
        - yeah so that's awesome so it's in the text you both found this in the text, so my question for you is what does this small machine do STUDENT what is the machine doing
        - They could yeah so we have to look for something to discover it
        - Absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean
        - Absolutely so let's say I asked you to write down your answer on a sheet of paper, what kind of equipment, will you be using for that
        - Vecause we're thinking about this this word evidence evidence is basically just it just means proof
        - So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right
        - So what does that small machine have a name does STUDENT anybody circle what that small machine is called
        - So microscope is a great example of one piece of equipment that they use, but they also use this use this this thing called the Lunar orbiter to investigate, and those things work together
        - So if we're looking at both of those sentences, if you STUDENT want to look at your sheet of paper if you're looking for those two words that lunar orbiter and that microscope, are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is?
        - Absolutely, yes, that is what evidence is it's called textual evidence, it means you're drawing your answer from that source
        - The first thing I want us to talk about when we're here in this STUDENT is I want you to think what is this question asking
        - what what does it mean to circle evidence
        - and I noticed that your answer um you definitely say a lot of equipment that scientists do use so i'm assuming you've probably done some sort of independent research or reading on this
        - Alright, so we're talking about the sort of evidence or the sort of equipment that scientists use to get to that water or to find that water, not the evidence that sort of looks at it
        - so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right
        - So STUDENT if I asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon,  how would you answer that using this textual evidence
        - But there was like a little parts that concern me and I wanted to help you STUDENT sort of find that you can fix those answers, by looking for things like evidence and complete answers
        - An action word is like a verb, and it tells us what you're gonna do with that equipment to that water
        - Can someone tell me what discover means?
        - That is absolutely correct
        - So we're specifically looking for a piece of equipment that was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - We're not trying to look at it, STUDENT, did you have something to tell me
        - We're trying to discover it
        - What is it, it's specifically asking us about water right
        - And I think it's really cool that you got to experience that
        - Yeah, STUDENT those things are really important
        - So what does equipment main STUDENT
        - So in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water
        - And while I'm reading, we are looking for
        - We are going to be in paragraph two, and I'm going to read it to you
        - So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay
        - So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it
        - Now they sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So what is a small machine, what's another word, maybe one that's in our question
        - That means the same thing
        - Does STUDENT know a synonym for the word investigate
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small, scientists said that one top of the one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water
        - So what is an ice deposit
        - Okay, do you want to share your answer with us
        - That means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - If you were looking straight at it
        - The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - You need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely
        - So what is that microscope, helping them do STUDENT
        - Yeah, they're looking at it really closely, they're not looking
        - They're not discovering it yet what in order to look at it really closely, they have to have already found it right
        - We had discovering it and we have looking at it, what are those two words
        - And what are those two different things
        - What kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson
        - And we had some really great responses
        - We're trying to figure out what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So when we look back at our text
        - So we're going to make sure that our answers can be proven from our text
        - So I think it's asking us to say like the title of the object
        - You did, you did say that, but if we look, it says What equipment
        - So what is the name of that machine called?
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So let's look back and see if we can find it
        - Because it's in our passage
        - So it says, NASA sent a small machine called a Looper Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So they did use it to find a lot of water in the craters
        - But what tool where they using?
        - It's telling us to talk about what equipment
        - But if we look back at our question
        - So let's read the sentence
        - But let's look back and see what that's called
        - Okay, so we're on number two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Now, what does a microscope do? What did it say a microscope did in the text?
        - Does STUDENT know what discover means?
        - So you have to find the water before you can look at it right
        - Before we can look at it
        - And we're going to use the Lunar Orbiter to find it
        - Right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first
        - Okay, but can we do we use the microscope to discover the water?
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - But let's look at our discussion question
        - You're right you did talk about the water
        - Does it say anything about the equipment that they used?
        - So we need to find the equipment that they used
        - So look back in your passage, what equipment did they use to find the water
        - If we look at number two
        - This Lunar Orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - These ice deposits are very small and what is what is ice?
        - Need you to narrow down your answer more specific
        - Let's go back to our text, we have these specific answers from the text
        - What equipment did they use?
        - They did find water
        - But the question wants to know what equipment did they use
        - But what equipment did they use to find it?
        - That are used on the moon, but we need to figure out exactly which piece of equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        - So we need to go back into the text and find specifically where it states what equipment they used to discover water on the moon and
        - But we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon
        - Let's go back into the texts and look
        - It yes is a specific tool or equipment that they used
        - It says it in the text
        - If we go back and look
        - It talks about equipment but there can be another word for equipment
        - Go back and look what's another word that we can use STUDENT
        - And what was the name of that machine
        - It tells why astronauts are using water from the moon and we need to go back into the text, STUDENT of us to figure out why we think that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - So let's go look what what he says, Can the astronauts to use
        - The water on the main for
        - What do astronauts use the water for
        - So why is it a valid valuable
        - But what does it say in the text about how astronauts use the water, it should be under the bottle of water is a valuable source
        - What are the ways that it's being used
        - Or how can it be useful
        - They can use what's on the man
        - That can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there
        - STUDENT right, and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - Right, and that's going to be very valuable for the astronauts right they're going to use the water
        - And also, STUDENT was saying that they wouldn't have to travel with it
        - Yeah, oxygen, and then they can use the hydrogen from the water for rocket fuel
        - From Earth to the Moon, and then I'll back right the indices what's there
        - Well, we're gonna learn some more
        - Your answer was, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - If you go back to the, I think it's the second paragraph, you'll see that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit and a large polar crater
        - But did you read the article because I'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her
        - If you would have read [unintellible] see where it says, NASA send small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate because you have to understand what the question is asking
        - That would be your question
        - What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it
        - And, um, if you refer back to the question, it did mention equipment
        - So I'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well
        - You're welcome and and Oliver, you said that you had circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Okay, STUDENT, which what, what, where did you circle or words
        - Did what important word or words did you circle in the question
        - So do you think one of the important words could be equipment?
        - Yes, and that's where they found it
        - And they do use that, but I'm just like with STUDENT
        - I asked him, did they use that to discover the water
        - And then we'll talk about the answer
        - That's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits
        - So, since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water, it is but frozen water and And they look in the large polar craters
        - I guess it was really cold the
        - It landed on the moon South Pole
        - So did you say you have a new answer
        - Did you have a chance, did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different
        - It, Luis, and we see here and we were talking about using STUDENT the other equipment
        - Right to help them survive
        - I appreciate the answers that you gave, let's go ahead and review some of the things that we've talked about
        - Thank you for joining me at the small group table, STUDENT
        - You are right, and I'm sure there's a lot more than just oxygen tanks and a lot more than what we know about  Here, since we are not an astronaut or we don't go out into space
        - Yes, they do have to use a lot of equipment
        - Maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen, or excuse me, just to find the water on the moon, what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points, they made
        - So tell me, just reading our passage STUDENT
        - Can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage, what kind of equipment
        - So you underlined equipment and discover
        - Did the scientists discover water on the moon with
        - How else could they have found or what other Oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters
        - When we read deeper into that passage, and the answer that you gave us
        - So you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks
        - but the ice deposits are, what can you tell me what that says the ice deposits are very small
        - So if they're looking for something very small and they're having to take that lunar orbiter in there
        - We also read in paragraph three
        - STUDENT based on our passage, what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing
        - And what makes you think that way
        - That word could that's in the second sentence
        - Can you circle that word could with your pencil, if you will, in the second sentence of paragraph four, it says, it could be useful in lots of ways
        - So would you think that the word useful iss also the same as maybe valuable if we look back in that paragraph and it's telling us, it could be useful
        - Do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future
        - I do agree with you
        - We haven't seen it yet because it is something that may take a lot of time and money for us to see but
        - That we haven't seen it yet
        - And so, carrying STUDENT that water may not be very may not be a very good idea if we can find water and a way to use it on the moon,
        - Am I correct STUDENT is that you're thinking
        - Space and on the spacecraft, it would be valuable to not have to carry STUDENT that weight if we had access to water on the moon
        - We could carry more equipment or more astronauts instead
        - And that would make it valuable to us
        - STUDENT and were you a person who said no
        - Can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind
        - And what did that first paragraph tells us? Do you know?
        - Let's stop for a second
        - Can someone paraphrase that paragraph for me?
        - Yeah, what would I deposits be, what do you think they would look like?
        - Is a tool that they use because the deposits are so small you can't see it with your eyes, you have to use the tool of a microscope to be able to see it
        - Okay that is moisture
        - But that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon
        - We can see frost with our naked eye, but what they found on the moon, we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the Lunar Orbiter and the and the microscope, being able to see that
        - STUDENT Can you tell me, can you read the paragraph, where it says
        - Where did you find evidence that
        - The scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where paragraph, does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Can you tell me where what you found
        - Why would a microscope, help us see the water
        - Because it's so it's so big, or it's so small
        - Do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink
        - In paragraph three, what does it say about
        - When, when it says we're not able to see it
        - What does it say right after that
        - So if we're having a glass of water with our lunch, we can see that
        - We can see that there's something in our glass
        - So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here
        - Do you know have you turned before naked eye
        - We can't see it with our naked eye
        - Well, they might have a because I found it in the in the crater
        - So there might be lots of it there, but it's so small
        - So how do you think that lunar orbiter is being able to do that
        - But how can that equipment, find the water on the moon
        - Because remember, in paragraph three, it says, we wouldn't be able to see the water
        - Does that tell us that that happened
        - You said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Let's talk about your answer
        - Did it say that it was there
        - So they can be found
        - Can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks
        - But this passage was only talking about
        - So is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen
        - What they found on the moon
        - Yeah, which that really isn't telling us
        - What the machine was right
        - STUDENT Did you find anything was talking about oxygen
        - The Lunar Orbiter helped find the water, but I want STUDENT of you to look in paragraph three
        - What does it say about the water in paragraph three
        - So what do we need to do, how do we find that we can't see
        - If you look in paragraph to
        - Can you look down at the four sentence
        - My cup right here is 30 ounces
        - Would though the word water have to be to take a ton of surface which
        - I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass
        - Well, it's great that you know a lot about space, but we're going to specifically talk about the moon and the water that was found on the moon
        - And we're going to look at these questions that we, that we have
        - I just want you STUDENT to look at them together with me so we can get a deeper understanding of our reading passage
        - But I want us to look deeper into that the question asked us, okay, because we STUDENT struggled a little bit with giving a specific answer to the question
        - Okay, so the two words that we really want to focus on is equipment and discover,
        - It says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon
        - But remember, the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was, discover so they in the paragraph
        - but we said when we circled in the second key word
        - so, would you like to look back in your paragraph to see if you can find
        - In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word
        - It's something that they did
        - NASA sand, a small machine, but can you look back in your paragraph to see if you can find the name of that machine
        - Okay, and STUDENT, you are correct
        - That's right, good job
        - Can you tell me what paragraph you found
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter
        - But yes, the two key words that I was wanting you STUDENT to find was evidence and valuable yes def
        - Did STUDENT see that in paragraph four, the word valuable is actually at the beginning of the paragraph
        - Can you tell me more?
        - So we know where it was
        - I wonder, it's asking about the equipment
        - So that's kind of like the machine that was used to discover it
        - But now we're asking about the machine
        - Did you find that answer in the in the text?
        - So they're synonyms of each other
        - So when we have something that's the same word for a tool we would call it a synonym
        - You right equipment and tools, the equipment is another word for a tool
        - You said that you use the microscope to look closely
        - I loved your answer, but I want to challenge you a little bit
        - do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking
        - So when you discover something, have you ever seen it before?
        - Finding it but planning it for the first time
        - Oliver, you told me that you circled the same answer as STUDENT but I want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope, because
        - Scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon?
        - And remember, we're looking for equipment
        - A lunar orbiter is doing a different job
        - They called a lunar orbiter to what?
        - Hmm so is that, again we're coming back to what STUDENT had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing
        - Which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover?
        - Hey STUDENT, so I want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        - I am so excited that you are excited about space, but I do challenge you to go back into the reading and think about that response that you gave me
        - So we're discovering water on the moon
        - And I think STUDENT That you had told us about oxygen tanks
        - Did they use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, or did they use it for something else
        - Okay, so we know, we know that much, but we still don't know what they used to, to discover the water on the moon
        - but that doesn't tell us what equipment they used to discover it
        - STUDENT, where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question
        - Yeah, we are looking for this specific tool used to discover water on the moon
        - Did they discover water with the microscope?
        - Hmm, let's look back at paragraph two for a second
        - They didn't talk to STUDENT on the moon, but they sent the lunar look for clues
        - So they sent the Orbiter to look for clues
        - And what did they find with the lunar orbiter
        - STUDENT Did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question
        - We're trying to figure out which one they used to discover water but, plot twist
        - Discovering orbiting, looking around
        - STUDENT remind me what investigating means again
        - Good, so they had to look for clues in order to figure out If there was water on the moon
        - They also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water STUDENT
        - Aside from the question itself
        - Okay, well, was there something else about the reading that you found interesting
        - Can someone raised their hand and tell me what is the question asking us for what are we trying to get the answer of
        - Someone raise your hand, what is the question asking us for
        - Did they use to discover the water that's what STUDENT is saying
        - Is that what you said
        - You didn't find that in the reading
        - Yeah, so that's a really good question
        - Um, remember that in the question we are being asked to determine like STUDENT says the equipment that's used to discover the water
        - So do you think Chris, that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water, we would need STUDENT of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water?
        - If you will refer back to your article back to your reading
        - I would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water STUDENT, I see your hand up
        - He said he thought it was in paragraph three
        - Okay, so, STUDENT just gave us an excellent answer
        - She said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two, and then I heard from STUDENT
        - Thank you for raising your hand so Farrah thought it was in paragraph three, and STUDENT thought it was in paragraph two,
        - So, STUDENT, could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water
        - Okay, Farrah does STUDENT answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three
        - Farrah, are you able to relate to what STUDENT was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water
        - Right to discover the water is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so someone raise your hand and tell me some of the other equipment that we've talked about in this reading
        - Was there any other equipment that they've talked about
        - What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope
        - What we read in our, what we read in the paragraphs was there other equipment that was discussed in the paragraph that we read?
        - Do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon?
        - Hey, STUDENT can you tell me a little bit more why you like Farrahs answer
        - I like the connection you made there
        - Can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon?
        - Do you think that the moon is wet? Or did it say that the moon is very dry?
        - Thank you so much for reading
        - So, STUDENT, did we discover that the moon is wet or dry?
        - So did they find craters full of water, or were they just looking for the water to find
        - Right, so they wouldn't, you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right
        - And what else could she have put instead of just a small machine?
        - And she said, NASA send a small machine
        - Right, so that's why I was looking at Jazmin's answer
        - What else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine, how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth?
        - Bus a small machine that could be anything
        - So what else could you put in your answer?
        - So you STUDENT picked out some really good keywords, the two key words that I looked at was equipment and discover
        - Why did you write down the answer that you did
        - OK, and Oliver why did you, why did you put down the same thing in STUDENT was your mind going the same way as hers?
        - Okay, well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and
        - Do you STUDENT know what discover means
        - Yeah, so we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used that the scientist is to find the water on the moon
        - They did send a small machine, but they you know what that small machine was called
        - And you are exactly right
        - Okay, I want you to look back in the passage and see if you can figure out what that small machine was called
        - I saw where STUDENT
        - What made you change your answer
        - Where you revised your answer
        - what made you change your mind
        - Um, you said using a small machine, STUDENT
        - You did correct your answer, but your answer
        - Uh, we're gonna figure out how to look back in the story and figure out a more in depth answer
        - What made you change your answer?
        - And the other machine that you found was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, STUDENT and you revised you're in
        - Scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that
        - So you put that the water
        - What made you change to change your answer
        - He is to discover water on the moon
        - So I want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientist
        - So we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon
        - What did you change your answer to
        - Where did you, um, can you tell me what paragraph you found that in
        - She said that, um, let me see if I found it NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Perfect so answering that STUDENT answered it perfectly
        - How many of you STUDENT were looking for the word water in the in the passage
        - So whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to  read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water
        - You didn't know anything about the water, so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice
        - Do you know what the small machine was called?
        - So, do you see how that is our answer? Does that help, STUDENT?
        - And the lunar orbiter it, in paragraph two, it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters, the ice deposits are very small
        - So where in the text can you find the word um, Let's see, let's look for the word, um, machine, machine in there
        - So let's look back in the text
        - But let's look more at that question
        - So it's asking for equipment, what kind of equipment searches for what, what are they looking for?
        - Now let's go back and look at that text
        - What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - So it is asking in the text field like back in the text
        - There's one piece of equipment that they used looking for that water right
        - So do you think the microscope to help them
        - Look for water while they're physically on the moon
        - So if you look in the text
        - They use the lunar orbiter right
        - And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water
        - See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon
        - but in this question specifically it's asking what piece of equipment
        - Did they use to search for water on the moon
        - So if you go back in the text and you look in that first part Where they're talking about the piece of equipment
        - They've talked about the moon being a desert right and they think that there's no water
        - Can you list off some equipment that they used
        - They're looking for specific piece of information are specific piece of equipment
        - And then we're looking for what?
        - Well, they were looking for water on the moon
        - They're looking for quick the equipment
        - And what does it say about the Lunar Orbiter
        - You think that you know everything about space, you don't have to learn everything more
        - Okay, so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water
        - So you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer
        - and, let me read this, um, you said, it, STUDENT, you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but the question is not asking you about what they are using to be on the moon, you have something to say, Savanah?
        - But I need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer
        - Yes, that would be an option to maybe STUDENT Can share with us something that he knows of of the space that is not in the in reading that you have to read
        - So what's the thing that was the equipment, that they use to find water on the moon
        - Now, what do you think that they use a microscope look really closely
        - What do you think that they need to look things really closely
        - So you really know what something microscope is something really, really, really small
        - For example, why do you think that they you a microscope
        - If you read the text again
        - And I wanted to kind of dive into these here
        - I want to make sure we're STUDENT on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent
        - Let's get even a little more basic there
        - let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars
        - So, um, what equipment do they talk about in this text? What do we see what what's getting used?
        - Very good, very good
        - I'm glad you're seeing it
        - So let's take a look back, STUDENT noticed, paragraph two could have some insight for us
        - So let's take a back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two,
        - So, STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Let's take care of that
        - Let's then switch track
        - And I'm really excited to get to talk to you STUDENT about it
        - So we should look at our responses and kind of see where we can grow and where we can improve with our understanding of the article
        - Now we got to read about something really cool
        - So I'd like to start with STUDENT
        - What your what your answer was, and sort of how you got there
        - So let's hear your answer
        - And how do you think you got to that answer
        - It's hard for me to know what you meant, because maybe what if I grade your paper before I grade STUDENT
        - As a, as the teacher, you know, if you want to put yourself in my position a little bit when I see response like that
        - So there's definitely some room for improvement there and you gave some good information but
        - What makes it very interesting to read
        - But we also have the part of that getting to the moon about searching them STUDENT there we've got this whole elaborate backstory
        - While there is some water there
        - It might not be a whole lot of might not be buckets and buckets and buckets and oceans of water
        - Can you remind me what the question says,
        - But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering
        - I'm glad we're able to see that
        - So let's take a look right now
        - You got it STUDENT figured out
        - We had your response as scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - STUDENT I'm excited to hear
        - Improvement and tell me what changes
        - You could give me one moment, STUDENT, talk to me about why you're confused what's going on
        - STUDENT, absolutely you can
        - Could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine
        - A STUDENT Do you think that's a good idea
        - It talking about more than one piece
        - So maybe a good response could be talking about, you know, including multiple ones that we read about it there
        - It could be more than one
        - But the way they use equipment here means it could be plural
        - How do you feel about your answer
        - What might you say instead
        - Just to kind of circle back a little bit
        - Now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the STUDENT there
        - If you were giving it another shot at it
        - Let me make sure I'm speaking, yes
        - So NASA, they're the ones that sent the lunar orbiter right
        - So we know that they're kind of the subject
        - They're kind of who this article was talking about, right
        - And they're the ones that use the microscope to look at the small, small, you know, particles of water when we find those on the moon
        - And so when we're giving our response to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - So you started off really powerfully and then up when you end your response there
        - You talk about a to look really close
        - What were you looking for?
        - So, but what are you looking closely for? Good job though
        - So you just provided the I'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely
        - Now, what was the microscope attached to?
        - But, and that's the part of that actually goes down and looks very closely, but we need to figure out how they found the water in the the craters
        - Well, let's think about it this way, STUDENT, should you look very closely at the water molecules without the microscope?
        - Well, let's look at what made you think of that
        - key word there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water
        - Discover the water right so it rereading the passage, what would you think led the scientists to discover the water
        - Once you take a quick glance at it
        - what did they find these with
        - But what is the text tell you about it
        - And what's the small machine called
        - Okay, NASA send a small machine
        - It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax
        - I'm going to help you read it
        - So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you
        - And what is it called,
        - So now let's look at the question what equipment did scientists used to discover water
        - So putting that together
        - You didn't actually name the machine, right
        - Does that answer the question
        - So if you look into your statement
        - Is it saying about the value of water on the moon, why is that very valuable
        - So that's going to be very valuable
        - So what else can be valuable there
        - It talks about in there
        - How are you going to is that STUDENT of the information or just one part of it
        - And what does it say about water can be split into
        - What else, what other purposes
        - Does this takes point two for that answer
        - Your answer isn't ready yet
        - It's not ready yet
        - So you said the water is not ready to eat
        - Is that what you're trying to say
        - So I just wanted to clarify that
        - And what led you that answer
        - Bob, what does it say that could possibly be the water can be used in
        - It has the potential to be valuable
        - That means it may it that is going to be valuable
        - I can't remember who said it but you have saving way
        - I think it was STUDENT right
        - Right, so it can be used for what else
        - And they have, what do you know, there's one more
        - So are STUDENT these things we just talked about that have value
        - Right, are STUDENT of these things, able to be done with water
        - Right, it might be expensive and take a long time, but yes
        - So these are STUDENT the things that you should listen
        - Where did you read that in the text
        - So we're going to go around and I would like you to share with me the evidence that you used STUDENT, let's start with you
        - I have your responses in front of me but I'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech
        - What evidence did you use
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle
        - STUDENT, what evidence did you circle to help you answer
        - To get more specific with our response
        - Did you find, were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you
        - And I want to hear from STUDENT really quickly
        - So let's look at your evidence so Farrah and Oliver looked right towards the microscope STUDENT looked
        - STUDENT of these are good pieces of information from our passage
        - At the craters on the moon and STUDENT was looking at, paragraph two at a small machine
        - So, Farrah says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover I'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found STUDENT, what did you want to add
        - Did they use to discover
        - She was saying that maybe if the key word is discover what equipment right equipment can name several different things
        - The water on the moon
        - What am I doing
        - So when I think of that word discover
        - And when you think of the word discover what are some things that come to mind when I'm discovering something
        - What are we doing STUDENT
        - When I first discover something
        - So STUDENT is realizing that maybe they didn't use the microscope tool to to first discover the water on the moon
        - So what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water STUDENT
        - I am seeing it for the first time I'm able to locate it
        - I remember STUDENT said when we discover something I'm finding it
        - So what what might they have used to first discover
        - Or the NASA said a small machine and she pulled that from the second paragraph, so if STUDENT will look back at the second paragraph
        - So when we are discovering something we are locating it for the first time we're finding it right
        - Scientists aren't sure if there's water out there or not they are going to investigate
        - Did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon
        - Discovered yes yes now STUDENT, later on, they're going to use other equipment right now that they've discovered the water
        - Later on they can study deeper
        - Into the water right they want to look closely at it
        - And that's what our passage says they tell us that if we if we want to look really closely in paragraph three, we're going to need another tool called a
        - Microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment
        - Yes or No are scientists using a lot of equipment
        - But what is the microscope helping scientists do
        - Yes, so they are using a microscope
        - So they are using the microscope to study and look deeper into the water, but they first had to find the water with the equipment, the small Lunar Orbiter and that's what our passage is about
        - Did they used to discover
        - Because remember, there's lots of equipment that is used for lots of different things
        - But the key was what equipment
        - So, so we needed to find the equipment
        - So always locate the key word right we had to figure out what they used to discover the water, which means to thirst locate it to first find it
        - So the key was what equipment
        - And then later on in the passage we learned, they, they used other equipment to study the water deeper
        - And how did you gather that information
        - Did you read our passage
        - And where did you find that out in the passage
        - And STUDENT then, actually Oliver you agree with Farrah
        - Will you tell me where you found your answer
        - So STUDENT also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage
        - What do you think
        - STUDENT What are you thinking
        - It was in our reading
        - But what special machine did they use
        - Where did you see that
        - Yes, that is what they sent
        - And STUDENT, what did they investigate when they got there?
        - And STUDENT, what happened
        - How did they study that the small ice deposits
        - But there's another tool that was used to discover the water and so that looked more closely at the water, but it wasn't what was discovering the water
        - Who knows, have a strategy that we can use
        - So what's some strategies that we can use to find that answer to that question
        - but an excellent place to look is in our text
        - We can look at the text and we can look for clues
        - Let's see, we're looking for some scientific terms
        - Who remembers what term
        - And the question that we're looking for
        - So what are the key words we already talked about water discover and equipment right
        - Yes, because the question does ask about water
        - Okay, you do need it to look closely, but that means you already found it right
        - So we want to find it
        - So that's the next step
        - First, we can look at it until we discover it or find it
        - If we look at, paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine, which is what you wrote what comes next
        - What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So let's look at our question again and see if that answers
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And there's one more word that we use a lot in science
        - STUDENT right, I'm convincing is good
        - Okay, so what is evidence
        - That's what we're going to do
        - So let's take a look at your answers
        - Okay, just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water
        - But does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable
        - It says it's good
        - I don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information
        - And you said, not for a long time, or it's not ready yet
        - I'm jab and STUDENT you both wrote no to this answer
        - STUDENT has given us some good information of why it could be good and why it could be valuable and and
        - And then Chris's answer follows up to that is, if they had water there so they wouldn't have to carry it around so that would be valuable because we STUDENT need water to drink
        - What would that be valuable
        - What do you think, do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable?
        - Okay, so that's a good story they talk about the water being heavy and that could be a positive thing that they're not having to carry on the ships,
        - Does that make sense STUDENT?
        - Can you find some reasons in there so far that eventually, it could be valuable
        - Um, well, just because we can't use it right now, at this moment, does that mean that in the future It wouldn't be valuable? What do you think
        - So see if you could find some evidence to support that it may be valuable in the future
        - Maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word, what would be another word that you can use
        - Can you figure out what the name of that small machine is
        - Just, um, can you go into more detail about what else, what other equipment might be used, other than just a microscope?
        - Um, but what did NASA have to send in order to use a microscope
        - They need a lot of tools
        - They didn't need a lot of equipment to get up there because there's not a lot of oxygen
        - Okay, so maybe if we look at the first few paragraphs
        - So paragraphs one and two, you will find something specific that they used it was a type of machine
        - It's kind of like a desert
        - That they sent up there so that they can find water because the moon is very dry
        - Let's look at paragraph two, we see in paragraph two, there's a Senate's about how NASA send a small machine called a
        - What is that machine called
        - They had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it
        - Yeah, so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So those ice deposits are made out of water
        - the microscope was actually to use just to see closer the water because the water was so tiny that they couldn't see it with their own eyes
        - The lunar orbiter was used to find the water
        - But the microscope was used for something different
        - So there's two different machines and equipment things that they used
        - Yes, and you are exactly right
        - They do need a lot of those equipment tools to use to get up to space because without on they wouldn't have been able to get on the moon
        - So STUDENT those equipments
        - But we was looking for the tool for water
        - But remember, the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water
        - So yes, you're right
        - Yes, they are very important to them so they didn't need them
        - So if you look at your passage you want to use the passage
        - The second half, which is paragraphs four, five and six and find the details in the text that tell you that there's some actual evidence that water could be useful
        - So what do you STUDENT think about that
        - Where is the evidence that might help you with this question
        - So why did you STUDENT think that what was your opinion about that
        - You STUDENT said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable
        - So I see that Oliver and STUDENT
        - Yes, and I completely agree
        - And that's what the passage said that it's going to take a long time but
        - It will take a long time
        - Like in paragraph five, there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable
        - How could it be used
        - You said how it was definitely important to have the water because they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - Yes, that's a good idea and I seen in your answer
        - That is very true
        - So it is very valuable to have the water
        - And he said that it was heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - Also see where STUDENT, he added, kind of onto your answer
        - It explains how hydrogen and oxygen could be split apart and they could use hydrogen for rocket fuel
        - Also, because in the passage
        - That was a detail from the text, but the reason that they split it apart is so that oxygen can be used
        - So they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things
        - And then the hydro Jen can actually be used for rocket fuel
        - So they breathe the oxygen
        - So I feel like it's more of your opinion based on the details and the facts that are in your passage
        - So it's more of your opinion based on what they gave you in the passage
        - So you have to use STUDENT those details
        - So about hydrogen and oxygen about how water is you can serve can't survive without water
        - So if you STUDENT would look at paragraph two, it has a two labeled
        - In the first sentence, it actually says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So this is the machine that actually went and explored
        - Yeah, well, we always have a good background knowledge of space
        - And that's really cool that you're interested in it, but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that
        - So that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more
        - Um, so does STUDENT remember what the name of that machine was called
        - Like, how did you come up with your answer
        - Jazmin, could you explain your answer to the rest of the STUDENT
        - I noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope, um, could you and STUDENT try and explain why you picked microscope?
        - But I kind of agree with STUDENT and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine, helped them look into those craters
        - But then the microscope helps you more analyze the water that they already found
        - So the way I looked at it was NASA send their small machine out to the moon and they analyze those craters and they found water
        - And I think the piece of using the microscope was for if I traveled to the moon with them and wanted to see the water for myself, I would have to check under the microscope
        - But the small machine did it without having to send people out there
        - I feel like the way the question was phrased
        - They were specifically talking about the Oliverice that discovered the water, not the behind the scenes like um
        - I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water
        - Well, STUDENT if you already know a lot about space
        - Can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did
        - I heard up until where you said the, you know, scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, because they can't breathe in space
        - I think the question was a little bit wanting more specifics on what Oliverice actually discovered the water
        - NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, I think we just wanted to have just a deeper discussion
        - So what equipment did scientist us to discover a water feel like we just wanted to have a just a discussion on what we STUDENT thought the answers were
        - They said that they wanted a microscope
        - You might have STUDENT that equipment and you might need all that equipment to get there, but I think the question is actually asking for, if I was holding that tool in my hand right now, would it discover water
        - You know why its valuable
        - It says, water is a valuable resource and then they list a whole bunch of reasons
        - So I think the question is really asking is, are you convinced that there that is valuable
        - So I want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable
        - But I'm a little concerned with Farrah and STUDENT on your responses, because you both said no, there was not convincing evidence
        - We have a lot of water here on Earth
        - So why do we want water from the moon and to um
        - And two, that's a lot of time time and money and as a, as a teacher, and we know we don't have a lot of money
        - Why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have
        - And the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel
        - Okay, you've been, we've been reading about the water on the moon and we talked about the moon is a desert and we are going to think a little bit thorough
        - Okay? Do you know what thorough is?
        - We are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions
        - So we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses
        - You told us that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Did you understand you answer?
        - Need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You said that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - What did you understand
        - You understand that answer?
        - Okay, and you understand what equipment they used?
        - And we also read in the paragraphs
        - What else did you, what other equipment should they be they use and other tools
        - And what else did you, did you read
        - What was the name of the small machine
        - And can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about?
        - We want to learn more
        - Okay, so it's important that we read so that we can discuss and learn a little bit more about water on the moon
        - But we're we're expanding our thinking
        - Can you share with your, your students STUDENT
        - Yeah, how did you come up with that answer
        - Okay, now we are going to think of strategies of ways that we can improve our answer okay and find those words in our
        - Writing that is going to help us connect and learn
        - We want to see the process of how are we going to
        - Reflect on our answer in think to improve our response
        - What could we do to improve that response
        - So we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about
        - Can you tell me a little bit more about that
        - It said that scientists found that there's evidence of water really deep in them, in the moon's craters, but that when they sent the machine up there to look for those ice that it was tiny, tiny little droplets that you can only see with a microscope
        - So what can you tell me from that information that I just gave you what other tools they might be using to learn about the water on the moon?
        - Um, but can you tell me why they needed a microscope to find this water
        - Can STUDENT else answer that question, though, why did they need a microscope to see the water
        - Was there a lot of water in the craters, or was there, just a little bit of water in the craters?
        - Okay, so let's go back to our text
        - And in paragraph two, the very last sentence, it says these icy deposits are very small
        - Does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water?
        - So, I see deposits are very small
        - We just need to make sure what we're looking back in our information to make sure we can find the right answers
        - Can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine
        - And so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right?
        - So that's one thing that they used
        - Just because it's not in the text doesn't mean that it wasn't being used because we kind of know, like you said, you saw that they use those things to be in space and so it talks about that NASA sent a small machine
        - If an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us, but they didn't send the astronauts
        - If you look at number, the number two paragraph
        - If you STUDENT will look at the passage
        - What kind of machines do they use? Can you go a little further with that STUDENT?
        - What machine did they use in that paragraph?
        - Let's look at that paragraph number two
        - And let's look at number three, I want you
        - These ice deposits are very small
        - This lunar orbiter looks like for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - let's look at number two
        - But what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope
        - Yeah, before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it?
        - Yeah, let's look at number two, that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me
        - Say the question for me again, Oliveron
        - Let's look back Oliveron, let's look what was the question
        - So what is it asking us
        - Yes, it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment, the scientists use, but the equipment the scientists used for what?
        - So it's using the equipment to do what?
        - So did they use the microscope to discover the water?
        - That would be very beautiful, very
        - Did you find that in the text STUDENT
        - How, what can I use the hydrogen and oxygen for
        - And why is that a big deal
        - Where did you find that in the passage, show us where you found that
        - Right, so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that STUDENT?
        - Mainly in, let's see, paragraph two
        - And that means the moon is still the driest desert on Earth, the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Alright, so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article
        - Okay so STUDENT, they do use microscopes right?
        - But do they use the microscopes on the moon, or would they have to maybe collect the samples, and then we'll get back to Earth?
        - But is that the type of equipment that they used to discover or investigate the water?
        - Or is there a better answer?
        - Well, you just read paragraph three again
        - What about number two?
        - Maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three
        - But before that, it talks about how they find evidence of the water right?
        - It doesn't talk about the water
        - Investigate, right, so we have to investigate our evidence
        - And what are we using to investigate our evidence?
        - Okay, well let's read the paragraph together again
        - Okay, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - There any type of equipment they might have used to investigate the water?
        - And is that lunar orbiter on the moon?
        - So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely
        - So let's go ahead and get into those answers
        - Okay, well that's perfect STUDENT
        - look really closely at what?
        - But the question is, how do we find the water
        - So what was used
        - What are the scientists used to find the water
        - So to answer your question, further, let's go ahead and look back in the article so paragraph one talks about how scientists thought the moon was a desert
        - That's a really good point
        - Okay, but now I know that's not true
        - So using the information in paragraph two, what equipment
        - Did the scientists use to find that water to investigate if there was water on the moon
        - So we use the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Okay, and we have to use the microscope to look at it
        - Right, and what was that machine called?
        - I think that's really interesting
        - And the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome
        - So is there convincing evidence
        - So remember, convincing evidence means that we're looking for details are in the article
        - That water on the moon could be valuable
        - Now this is a tricky question
        - Because valuable, we have to use the definition that they gave us in the article for that word
        - So what is the meaning of valuable there?
        - So something that is useful or important already so something that is useful or important
        - Let's see, Farrah and STUDENT, you both said, It's not ready yet, or it would take a long time for the scientists to get it and even those both of those things are true
        - So what are some things STUDENT of you that water could be used for on the moon like it says in paragraph four and five
        - Can we look back for some details? STUDENT
        - Yeah, you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else STUDENT?
        - So those are very important things
        - You can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - STUDENT You said water can be
        - See, um, let's talk about sorry I have to keep looking back at my picture
        - However Is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use?
        - Okay, so if I just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen, did that tell you any information about it on the moon, or about astronauts?
        - So would you be able to see it with your regular eye? Would you be able to look down at it?
        - But did they? After reading that last paragraph we just read?
        - So the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - So what type of equipment did they have to have in order-- if it was there to see it?
        - So is there any water on the moon?
        - So did they actually discover that water was on the moon?
        - But does it mention that in the paragraphs?
        - So where can we find water on the moon? Or where can water be found?
        - It says, Scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters
        - These craters are dark places where the sun never shines
        - NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So what equipment did they use?
        - They use a lot of equipment
        - While that's true, is that what they used?
        - And just like STUDENT, he had mentioned some as well
        - Okay, so what was our question
        - Can someone read that for me
        - So we're going to talk about a new skill, a new skill of circling or underlining key words from the question that are in the text
        - So here's what we're gonna do, STUDENT
        - We're going to go through each of your responses
        - Okay, so let's look at your response
        - Okay, so let's look back at STUDENT answer real quick
        - First, what did you say
        - So let's look at where it says that its on paragraph three, it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope
        - So does that say that that's what NASA sent though STUDENT?
        - STUDENT, it says, you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So now let's look back in paragraph two, what does it say that they sent to investigate the water
        - But does that say, that's what they sent
        - These craters or dark places where the sun never shine
        - So in our first paragraph there, it says that you just read it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - So you didn't find your answer from paragraph 1
        - So paragraph 2 says on this worksheet that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So you're going to need something to-- small, right? Something that can look at small things, correct?
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater
        - I'm sorry, in a large polar crater
        - Very good job reading
        - Stop right there for a minute
        - So paragraph 2 says that NASA has sent a small-- you did a great job rating by the way
        - But, and STUDENT, you did too
        - So we know that the ice deposits are very small
        - Does that sound good to you STUDENT
        - So we've already read the text about the moon in class and I just want to talk to you STUDENT about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage
        - So you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct
        - Okay, so I just want to make sure that heard you out there
        - Maybe if there was another machine mentioned, or how they how they discovered the water
        - But how did they discover the water
        - I know they can look at the water with the microscope
        - Do you know if it had
        - A more specific name
        - Oh, it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name
        - So it was a small machine, but it was the more specific name for it was a lunar orbiter rat
        - What did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence
        - So investigate means that we're kind of
        - So they used, how can we
        - How could we restate this question
        - How can we restate that question in our answer so that we know when you're reciting a
        - What will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about
        - How could we restate that question
        - So you mean that it could be valuable, but it's not valuable right now
        - Um, so, STUDENT, you said not for a long time
        - read what you wrote your STUDENT
        - Is that right, is that what you meant by that
        - Can you can can dig a little deeper for me and tell me how, how is it not really valuable right now but it or
        - Let's see, let me think about that
        - Can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while
        - How it is so you feel it is valuable, but not for a while
        - Why it's going to take a long time
        - So, so you feel it will be valuable, but it's not available right now
        - Like say that those things were, say that time and money wasn't a problem and it could, you know, think about
        - Um, you know, trying to think about if those were issues, how it could be important
        - Now try to think about that next time
        - What's your quick what's, what are you, I'm sure
        - That is exactly right
        - We do need water to survive
        - And stay hydrated and you can't survive that water, that's exactly right now in our text you know how it said
        - You said yes is astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - You can't survive without water
        - Maybe not leaving, but at least be in there longer and spaceships can't really carry heavy
        - Say there it says that, you know, one day, you know, they'd like to have people living on the moon and being there for longer periods of time
        - I can't really can't carry
        - enough amount of water to subside people for a long time, right, because waters really heavy
        - So do you think it
        - You know, it takes up space on the spaceships
        - You said water is is heavy
        - Yeah, I was trying to get to that
        - So, but they still have to carry it and ships because they have to get there
        - They don't have to carry it and ships anymore
        - They are being able to inhabit the moon right now
        - And and kind of back to Space and you know we're not
        - They hope to one day in the future
        - So that's one reason it's it's really valuable that
        - But so right now if they went to the main the ships would have to carry it
        - So how can that make it valuable
        - We can be able to find water there
        - and STUDENT Can you tell me a little bit about your answer
        - You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - So let's, it was very important, because you can do so water is made up of hydrogen, oxygen, and you can take those things that
        - Lead them and then you can use the oxygen, hydrogen for other things
        - So let's say so in order to follow my advice or to found that base and be able to be able to what's some things that if orders split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - It's in your text and about paragraph five,
        - The oxygen just it's in, it's in here
        - So we can split the water
        - Breathing is very crucial
        - So with the hydrogen and oxygen and use the oxygen for air and that's very valuable and very important
        - What's another I really, I'm really glad you found that
        - What's another thing in that paragraph that you could use
        - We cannot live without oxygen
        - The oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water, but what's something else that they can be used for
        - And what much Nate rocket fuel for here on the main
        - They have to right now they have to have enough fuel to get them somewhere and to get them back and that takes up space on the own the
        - Yeah, because they have to get NASA has to be really careful
        - Yeah, they used to go home
        - Spaceship so down here later in our take to talk about how
        - Well, I bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said, Why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment
        - Good, so I'm glad that you recognize that just have to have oxygen when they're in space
        - So in the question asks us
        - But if you look at the title, we're talking about water in space
        - So you talked about
        - It says what equipment
        - Where did they find it so
        - Did they use not
        - Why did you, why did you look for
        - Why did you say that they use small machines
        - So you specified that they use small machines
        - Okay, so let's let's think about your answer
        - So you said they use Microsoft's correct
        - So why did you say they use microscopes
        - They used to look at water is it what they find the water with
        - Oliver, you said you found the same exact answer, as I'm STUDENT
        - Is it talking about how they water or is it talking about
        - So, which one would that be the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope
        - What do you know about ice STUDENT
        - Oh, kind of the same thing, isn't it
        - Why did you say not for a long time
        - You said no because not not for a long time
        - So, STUDENT, the water can be
        - You said that water can be split into two parts
        - Why did you tell me, water can be split into two parts
        - But the question says, is it convince if we have the convincing evidence
        - Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space
        - Does that tell us
        - But, and I want to specifically look at what you wrote on your answer
        - You said that you could
        - Stay hot, they need to stay hydrated and you can't survive without water
        - Now, why did you, why did you choose to tell me about that when answering this question
        - It says, Is there convincing evidence
        - What did you say before you told me that what was the first part, you just read there
        - And I want to specifically look at the question
        - What it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water
        - So that would be good
        - STUDENT, you talk to me about water being heavy
        - Why did you choose to talk to me about that
        - When you said that
        - So you said water is heavy you found that in the first paragraph
        - And I, I want to ask another question
        - Where it is that water at when they say it's heavy
        - So read that sentence again for me
        - Why did you say they're not ready yet
        - They you said they're not ready yet
        - So what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves
        - So what does it mean to be valuable STUDENT
        - So here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at
        - Right, so they're having to take up this water in the space and its way in down that spaceship
        - Yeah, so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle
        - And let's see, I wanted to talk with with um
        - And so that's a little bit more in depth than just the oxygen tank
        - We're talking about water on the moon
        - What is this, what was the small machine called
        - So I think that's in paragraph two,
        - Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two,
        - So what did this machine, do
        - And so you said they sent this machine
        - It does, it does investigate what does it investigate read that second sentence again
        - Okay, so it lands where?
        - Okay, and you said, so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits?
        - How much water did they find
        - Um you so talk to me about that
        - Does it say anything about finding a lot of water
        - Where does it say they found a lot of water? Let's look, look at that first paragraph
        - That means that, so think about um think about if you dug a really big hole so they found it deep within the moon's craters, they found it really far down
        - Right, so they found it deep
        - But it just says that they found evidence that there was water
        - Not that they found a lot of water, they just not evidence, meaning that they seen water there
        - Does that mean that there's a lot?
        - So, STUDENT, you said that was your answer too, so that's awesome
        - Can you tell me what that means
        - Okay, so it is an equipment
        - What does this equipment do? If I put something under a microscope, what does it do?
        - Am I looking at stuff
        - What am I doing?
        - Am I making it look really big, so I can really see it or am I zooming out
        - Well, I wanted to call you back here, because even though you know a lot about space in your answer that you gave to my first question, tells me that you know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks
        - we want to really focus on what it says and our article today, we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon
        - I want to talk about your answer real quick how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - How did you get to that answer
        - So when you are listening and answering this question
        - Do you have any really important words in that question
        - Our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So when you discover something you're looking for it
        - So did I need, um, you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely
        - So did they use a microscope to find it, or just a look at it
        - Well, they, they have to find it first
        - They use it once they find it
        - So they don't even know where to look for it on the microscope
        - Okay, so in our text on the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Um, well what machine, what piece of equipment did they use?
        - Let's use evidence from our text
        - Said  they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name
        - So remember the discussion question is-- yes STUDENT?
        - STUDENT right, so I see that you have all, um, did your best and answering the question, and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text, but we want to get this specific answer
        - Alright, so, um, can STUDENT tell me what paragraph, did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon?
        - What if they looked at, um, how did they know where that water is?
        - But we're trying the, we're trying to find how did they find STUDENT that water because it
        - Um, what about in the first paragraph there? Do we see anything about any type of machine that they used to find it?
        - So let's look at the second paragraph and see if it mentions any type of machine
        - Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used?
        - So does this whole machine, is it given a name? Do we see any place where it's given a name at?
        - Now investigate means to?
        - It's a small machine to investigate
        - So it says the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph
        - Well, we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate
        - Let's read it together real quick
        - Do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool, the that the astronauts had on them to protect them?
        - But the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon
        - Would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope
        - Okay, well, can you tell me why you might have chose that answer
        - What made that microscope stick out to you
        - And what made you think about the craters on the moon
        - But why did you choose that out of the out of the tags
        - In the story, which Chris brought up so that STUDENT had a little part in the story, but we want to talk about what they found
        - And they also talk about craters
        - How to find water on the moon, don't we, yes STUDENT
        - Okay, it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found is mcroscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you weren't looking straight at it
        - Wow, what were you using it to find?
        - What else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon?
        - Well, let's look at page, paragraph three, okay? Do you see where they're numbered each paragraph has a number beside of it
        - Can STUDENT take their finger and put it on number three, find the number three, paragraph 1, 2, 3
        - Do you? Yeah, okay
        - Let the rear end of that paragraph, it talks about what kind of small tool, scientific tool that they would use
        - But what does it tell us in the story?
        - Okay, but what does the reading tell us? You possibly could use oxygen tanks
        - Well, that's a very big statement because I don't even know STUDENT about space, space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that I think that you have be eager to learn about
        - I'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it
        - So this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff
        - I didn't even know about water on the moon
        - So I think it's very beneficial that you're in this STUDENT
        - Does that stand to say anything about any equipment?
        - So if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - No, I don't see anything in there either
        - So let's move on to our second one, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used?
        - So we already seen stanza to that we can support our answer to the question, because we have found it
        - So the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon, and they use that by starting with the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Does that make sense?
        - So you had to have both forms of equipment to figure out the answers that we were looking for in this passage
        - So once we investigated the moon, we could then use our tool to discover more about it
        - So we're going to look at some of your answers that you have and ways that we could improve some of them and some strengths that many of you did have in your answers
        - So before we even look into our text we want to look at our question
        - The question is specifically asking what equipment did scientists use to discover the water
        - Oh, text evidence is something I wanted to talk to you STUDENT about
        - We know that we want to look for some sort of equipment and based around water
        - So text evidence is going to support your answers and pull it straight from the text so that you always know that your answers are close or semi correct
        - So, in the very first paragraph
        - If you STUDENT look at your text it says that scientists have found evidence
        - Did they use to discover water
        - So we want to find proof to the question of what equipment
        - So evidence is a really important word because it means that there's going to be proof in our passage
        - And they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water
        - So let's talk about that just a little bit
        - So what made you choose that as your answer
        - So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water
        - They use it to examine the water
        - So if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it
        - But we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions
        - So I want you STUDENT to look at question number two
        - Okay, water could be one
        - Do you see any other words that could be important
        - How about the word evidence and the word value
        - So will there be convincing evidence or will there not we'll find out
        - Evidence means that we're going to prove our answer that in this passage, it tells us the answer to this question
        - So now what I want you to do is look into your text before we talk about the responses to the question
        - Do you see the word valuable when we look at the subheading water is a valuable resource
        - Also says the word valuable
        - I see some nods yes, it says in the heading that that that water is a valuable resource
        - So we already know, sort of, the answer to our question that it is a valuable resource
        - So when we look at the very first sentence, it says water on the moon would be valuable
        - But do you see in our heading and in our first line, how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource
        - So it's already telling us it's valuable now Farrah and STUDENT
        - I know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not
        - It then says water is heavy
        - So when you're if you are going up into space, would you want to carry STUDENT these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon
        - Okay, so in this article right here or in these paragraphs
        - There's a few reasons as to why waters valuable
        - So you are right in the fact that it is heavy
        - And so that is one reason that water on the moon would be a valuable resource
        - It takes up a lot of room
        - So if we keep going into paragraph five, it says, water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - Would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon
        - Now I'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe
        - So if water can provide oxygen
        - If you're able to create hydrogen and oxygen in the moon versus having to take it STUDENT the way up into space
        - We can also look at it goes into further and says that hydrogen and oxygen can be used as rocket fuel
        - So that could be a possible reason that it's a valuable resource
        - So that would also take some weight off your spacecraft
        - So do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples
        - Right, you, you probably have an extensive knowledge of outer space through you know TV and stuff, but we're in this STUDENT so that we can focus on
        - So I suppose I will start with
        - So that's the main goal of what we're working on together
        - extracting information from from informative text
        - Will you tell me what what
        - Where did you pull oxygen tanks from the text for them, discovering water
        - your thought process was for answering that
        - But I'm in the text
        - There's a focus on what machine actually they which I actually used to discover the water on them
        - Could you look closer at the text at the at the forefront of text, maybe, and
        - Okay, well, we'll go over yours too
        - So you mentioned a small machine
        - So it says what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon, but a small machine could mean anything
        - Science is a your answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - And so it looks like you should you need to focus on the question more as well as the text
        - So you're going to be looking for our
        - but the question is asking what equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon and so on and saying, equipment, it's looking for what types of machines or technology
        - Did they need to discover that water
        - When, when a text is talking about discovering the water, you're going to be looking for the types of machines they used to do that
        - So scarce and so microscopic on water and found you know only unlike little trace amounts and you would need a microscope to look at it, but
        - About discovering something you know like what they actually used to find it, not what they used to look at it
        - But before that, how did they find it so it would help you better to understand the question and understand
        - Well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Where did you find your answer from the text, which paragraph?
        - So what from the text, how can you work, how can you focus to see when when you've got the question what equipment did scientists you discovered water on the moon
        - What, what are you looking for?
        - Okay and machines and tools that do what?
        - So when you're looking for what type of machines or stuff they use to look for the water when you're looking at the three paragraphs, where, where would you find that information, one of the paragraphs specifically
        - do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming
        - But I think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water
        - I think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well
        - And I agree with you, STUDENT
        - So the two verbs here where
        - Okay, so let's take about
        - So, so which tool or gadget or technology even or machine is was used to discover or identify or reveal or find the water
        - Yeah, and paragraphs three and four
        - Let's look at specifically what the text is telling us though
        - Both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water
        - Did you circle in the text
        - Um, what, what did you what kind of evidence
        - Okay, well, you know, this is this is asking specifically based on the reading
        - You said that they sent a small machine, what, um, what piece of evidence
        - Know why they found Craters of what they use to discover define Craters of
        - That's I think that's the key part is, what did they use to discover the water or what did they use to find the water or maybe we could even say identify the water
        - What did they use to find that
        - So when they were first going into space on the moon when they first got to the moon
        - but what did they use it first to discover it so
        - We see that they used after the fact, after they found the water they used a microscope to look closely at the water like STUDENT said,
        - Those are the ones I think we need to look at again
        - At paragraphs three and four
        - In a large polar crater
        - It's in a small machine, but specifically the small machine was caled, what
        - So you were right
        - Okay, well what paragraph
        - Do you think we can find that in
        - What made you choose that word
        - What made you choose the word microscope
        - It talked abou the water that they found on the moon was microscopic like you had said, and that's that the word microscopic means that you can't see it Without looking through that microscope
        - Can you tell me why you put NASA send a small machine and nothing else
        - I think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger
        - Well, let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon
        - And if they didn't wear those they could die
        - So yes, astronauts do wear those as a protective measure
        - So when they're on the moon, they can survive because it's a really cool place
        - Right, you need so because our, our question and what was what equipment it scientists use to discover water so they're asking the question is asking what scientists use
        - So specifically, what do they use not their suits
        - But what they use to find the water
        - Does that make a little bit more sense
        - How did you find that answer
        - And you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and I did like how you said you cannot survive without water, um, where did you come up with that answer
        - Is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we STUDENT need to survive with water
        - So that is true
        - It does talk about water being heavy, how come you responded with that
        - So really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon, and they would be using that water from the moon
        - The whole reading, she is talking about water on the moon
        - You kind of both have very similar responses
        - So Luis Oh no, sorry, STUDENT, you talk, you said no
        - So we need to figure out yours and Farrah's
        - So what do you mean by that
        - You had responded similar and you had said no, not for a long time
        - Do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more?
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time
        - Well, sometimes we feel that way, but you're, you might have some knowledge that wasn't really covered inside of the texts that maybe your other friends in the STUDENT can learn from
        - So work on STUDENT learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end [teacher name] will gladly to answer those
        - How come you do that
        - So Oliver, I see that you had circled the same answer as STUDENT
        - So did you find that on your own prior to STUDENT writing that or did you kind of just copy that?
        - A lot of you have really great responses, but the reason why we're kind of in this small STUDENT is to kind of build off those responses
        - So although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better
        - But what are we looking closely for?
        - Okay, and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use?
        - Well, so in in here, it talks about the water on the moon
        - Do we STUDENT remember reading that part?
        - So we know that that the planet or essentially what is being discovered is one, the water, but the water on the moon specifically, right? So, in the first paragraph that talks about scientists that found evidence that there can be water deep within the moon's polar craters
        - So then in the second paragraph, it talks about NASA using this small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Does that make sense
        - So what they're doing is that they're using the Orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters
        - And then what they did was, in the third paragraph, they talked about the microscope
        - And so you have to look at it under that microscope, and that's where what STUDENT was talking about
        - And it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely
        - So STUDENT of those tools that they've used helped discover that
        - So what we're going to do today is look at the article that you STUDENT previous you read called water on the moon
        - And we're going to look at the discussion question in regards to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you just raise your hand
        - So, if you will, just kind of raise your hand and I'll call on you
        - And then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work
        - So what we can do is just kind of go around the room
        - But if we're looking specifically at a question it's asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - If you look back in your text, it says specifically that they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - They did find craters of water on the moon
        - And that's kind of why they went up to space
        - They wanted to see if there were water in these craters
        - They did discover that, in fact, there are water in the craters
        - Want to know what did they use to find that water
        - But like I said, we're if we're looking at the specific question is
        - And if we look in number two in the article the machine that they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter
        - But if you look at number three, it says to look closer to actually see it, you would have to use a microscope
        - What they used in space to find the water was a lunar orbiter
        - So your answer actually would be correct
        - But what they, the machinery, they use what's called the Lunar Orbiter, but you'd also need a microscope, like you said, to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters
        - You would need a microscope
        - But the, the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water, they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live
        - But today, what I hope to do is kind of come together, work on some strategies that we can kind of hone in on the answer that, that is specifically wanting
        - Good, because we are wanting to know what specific equipment, the scientists used to discover STUDENT right there
        - What do you think buddy
        - In this question the equipment is to discover water on the moon
        - Okay well equipment is the key word
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - But we got to figure out what's, what is the whole point of the equipment
        - They do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small, but to find the water itself
        - So they can actually view it
        - And that makes sense
        - They didn't necessarily use the microscope, when they found the water, then the microscope came into play
        - Now, does STUDENT see where she found that out because that is the specific name of the equipment they use to find the water
        - So does that make sense where we got that from
        - And like you said STUDENT told me that were the key word was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says NASA send a small machine called a lunar Order, order to investigate
        - So we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good
        - But I think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question
        - Well, I hope you're right
        - Those are all very important words STUDENT
        - Okay well valuables and very important word, but we also need that convincing evidence on why water is valuable
        - OK, so the convincing evidence is also very important
        - Well, water is very important because we're wanting to find out, you know,
        - So we need to really find the evidence in the text on why that water is valuable
        - So water is an important word, but we want to find the evidence on why it's valuable if that makes sense
        - How can water be valuable
        - Farrah and Oliver, both of STUDENT kind of said no it's not ready
        - Okay, now if you go back into the into the text
        - There's no real evidence on why it's valuable this time
        - Do you see anywhere in there that talks about, you know, how it could be valuable
        - So if you go back into the text
        - You see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable
        - No, no, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, if you're able to find water on the moon
        - Moving forward, this could be very valuable
        - It could, you know, for example, what you like the text says you can drink the water, they could use the water
        - because if you go on the read further
        - Eventually for like fuel for this spaceship
        - And I'll see yourChris and you put water is heavy
        - They don't have to curate in the ships anymore
        - So I guess with your answer
        - That way they don't have to bring it back and forth, which it talks about in the text, so
        - You're kind of saying that it's important
        - So by you saying they don't have to carry water
        - Let me just kind of build off that
        - What does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there
        - You know, because they can use it for fuel and they can also drink it
        - Yeah, so they don't have to carry it
        - So that's less stuff they have to care or, you know, to bring with them on the spaceship, so they can have room for more people, more supplies and things like that
        - So that's a very good response they have you got a question, buddy
        - Yeah, we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text, and we're just working as a STUDENT to kind of share our knowledge with each other
        - Because we're not just
        - So does STUDENT want to volunteer to go first, where we can kind of critique and go through our answers and look and see how we can find maybe some more detail to support our answer
        - I saw bits and pieces of that in there
        - But if you look at it, it says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So our key word here is equipment
        - So hopefully you'll remember us talking about that
        - So our key word here is equipment and discover
        - Alright, so let's go look
        - Let's say at your paragraph three, where does it talk about discovery in there
        - And so let's go back and look and see what's the word that goes with that word discover, so we know discover means to what somebody does STUDENT can answer
        - To find right so if we're looking to find something
        - What are some of those words, maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something
        - Alright, so what, what did they use to investigate
        - What do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text
        - It says, NASA send a small machine
        - What was the name of that small machine
        - And then if you look at Jazmin's answer
        - So do you think that might be where we look for our answers, STUDENT
        - Okay, so do you think that's a good place with are looking for answer about water being valuable
        - Yep Okay perfect, so let's go down to that section
        - Now, what, what does it mean if something is valuable
        - Okay, so something that's expensive is considered valuable
        - Right, something that you can use
        - Though the paragraph that you STUDENT read did it tell you what they meant by valuable
        - Did what did it say valuable meant
        - Let's underline very important
        - Another way to say or state
        - Why would water on the moon, be very valuable or very important right so what, in what ways so that word convincing evidence
        - So make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too
        - So that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right
        - astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen
        - Um, so I have seen your responses to our discussion question and I wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers
        - It's good to see you too
        - What did it send the small machine to do?
        - So you talked about NASA sending a small machine
        - If we look back at the text
        - All right, STUDENT, underline that sentence, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Or how did you come to that conclusion
        - So you've STUDENT read this once through, right?
        - So let's look back at the text
        - Can you explain what you mean by that
        - Now, Oliver, you said you circled the same response as STUDENT
        - Okay, how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion
        - So what tool in here does it say they use to find it?
        - It's like finding something so finding it versus looking at it closely are two different things
        - So the question is asking what equipment did they use to find the water
        - And so, STUDENT, you've mentioned that it will be a long time
        - Why do you think that
        - It will take a long time to do it and will take a large investment, a lot of money will be spent to get the water
        - In other words, it's not available right away
        - Yeah, and that's certainly very true
        - But if they could get to it
        - And after a while, with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it
        - Okay, so it'll just take them a while but it'll be important
        - And why do you think that
        - STUDENT, you mentioned that That the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated
        - Why is that true?
        - Yeah, and so that would make it valuable right
        - Astronauts have to carry it in space
        - That's right and Luis mentioned that that water is is very -- sorry STUDENT
        - And actually, you mentioned that water was very heavy and that right now
        - But if they could get water on the moon, that would certainly be viable
        - Why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon, rather than taking it with them?
        - So that's very useful
        - So that's a very good observation on your part STUDENT
        - And then if they didn't have to carry STUDENT the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people
        - That's certainly another great use for water is that you could use it to potentially grow your food
        - And so now that's less things that you have to carry with you
        - It has no value, right
        - So certainly, if it's very expensive and hard to do that may or may not be able to get to the water and so unless you can get through it
        - Say that we do have enough money
        - And we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable?
        - And it can be broken down into those two elements oxygen and hydrogen
        - And so if you can break it down into those two elements, then you can use it for other things
        - Yeah, that that was a very good answer
        - You've probably heard water STUDENT through maybe have H2O, The H stands for hydrogen and oxygen
        - So you have to take action with you or if you can use the water to make oxygen you take advantage there about hydrogen
        - Exactly the room you're in now you're breathing oxygen
        - And because we have it in our atmosphere, the moon has a very Limited atmosphere and there's not enough oxygen to breathe
        - What can hydrogen be used for?
        - What do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for?
        - Okay, so I mean like rocket fuel and the moon, I would that be by valuable
        - And so when you look at that word
        - Let's look at that word again where it says that, it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing?
        - And it's called microscopic because often it is very small, and you wouldn't need a microscope to see it
        - Well certainly you can see some small things with a microscope
        - But there's other ways to measure things that may be very, very small
        - They were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic
        - But if we look at the the information that was actually provided
        - And the first statement that it says there
        - So STUDENT look look at it together
        - Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon
        - See how it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate? STUDENT, what do you think a lunar orbiter would be?
        - That's correct, because if you look at the name Lunar Orbiter and look at what each of those words mean
        - Lunar refers to what? Do you know?
        - Lunar means something dealing with the moon
        - And so what would an orbiter be? What does orbit orbit mean?
        - Because Lunar Orbiter means orbiting, flying around the moon
        - And so they have a small machine
        - It's not actually on the moon
        - It's simply flying over the moon around the moon to take a look at that the possibilities of water
        - For example, STUDENT, do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope, but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon
        - And if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope
        - But in this case, they haven't actually landed on the moon
        - They're simply using the Lunar Orbiter to study the moon from a distance
        - What did you read in the article about the equipment that they used
        - But what equipment do you think they used to find it
        - You didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water
        - Do you know what a lunar orbiter is
        - They sent a lunar orbiter have up there
        - Well, let me show you a picture of a lunar orbiter
        - This is a lunar orbiter simulation picture of it flying over the moon
        - Like satellite flies in space
        - So it's orbiting the moon
        - It was launched on a rocket from Earth transition to the moon and then it can circle around the room
        - And so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon
        - So, STUDENT, what, what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water
        - You mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Why would they need to use a microscope
        - and so STUDENT You mentioned that you can see water puddles
        - Okay, well a microscope is used to look at something really, really closely because the water on the moon is is there's so little of it and it's so small
        - Certainly if you saw a water puddle, you know, that was water on the moon, the water is much smaller
        - In fact, if you had a sample from there, you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope
        - So it's very hard to see
        - That's a use STUDENT those things because the environment in space requires him to have been extra equipment right? There's a lot of things that they need to do
        - And so certainly being able to drink water and using it for other things
        - For the most part, astronauts will take the water they need with them, but if they could find a way to get water from the moon, and that would save them having to bring it
        - Maybe brushing their teeth and simple things like that, or to cook with water, it's very, very important to have
        - Okay Oliver or Sabina, what do you STUDENT use a microscope for
        - So they use a machine a tool, similar to the microscope, like you STUDENT said to discuss to investigate and discover, and that was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So they did use a small machine
        - Do you know what the name of that machine was
        - Do you know they were trying to find
        - And what did that lunar orbiter do so
        - So if we go back and read this sentence that I'm STUDENT read in the name of this small machine was a lunar orbiter
        - So what did the lunar orbiter do STUDENT
        - And what did they discover in those ice deposits
        - So I'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water
        - So those ice deposits held what
        - So by using the Lunar Orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores
        - What was holding the water
        - So what does the oxygen tank do STUDENT
        - So what equipment do they used to help them discover water
        - So that equipment is something that they use to help them breathe
        - So what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used
        - So we think of convincing evidence
        - What does that mean to you, STUDENT
        - So it's something that
        - What about you, Demi
        - Needs to be stated it in a way that you can believe it right
        - So there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have
        - Okay, STUDENT what does convincing mean?
        - Okay, so they're making statements to make you believe something
        - STUDENT what is convincing for you
        - So we're talking about convincing evidence
        - Evidence means information that supports the statement being made
        - So we're going to look at the evidence, the information that supports
        - astronauts could do what with the water
        - And that's something that's valuable to them because we STUDENT have to have water to stay hydrated
        - You're very good drink it
        - What makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence
        - And you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence
        - Oh, so you're looking at it from the fact that the moon is not ready as a whole to be lived on right
        - What else, what else do we mean STUDENT besides water
        - We need air to breathe
        - Did they have air on the moon yet
        - But if there was water on the moon, but that help us
        - They can drink it, can we survive without water
        - So I wanted to go over the discussion question that you STUDENT answer
        - Okay, they do use that in space
        - But I think the question is asking, what did they use to discover water
        - So, do you know what specific tool they use to discover water
        - Can you find that in the text? Is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that?
        - And that is a great answer
        - Can STUDENT help me explain what the word discover means?
        - But if we look at what the question is asking, it's asking what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon? That word discover is really, really important
        - And I think, STUDENT, you said you had the same answers her
        - Find, is a perfect word
        - So when you discover that means you're finding something for the first time
        - And what does that lunar orbiter do?
        - So my question was, can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does? So I want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two
        - So then, paragraph three goes on and talk about how the moon is still drier
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter, STUDENT, the small machine that they sent, it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Now these ice deposits are very, very, very small
        - Well, that means if we go back to paragraph two, what did they use to investigate
        - What did they use to investigate?
        - So when we investigate something, we're normally discovering something
        - To investigate and what did they discover when they used that small machine to investigate? What did they discover?
        - Yes, so they found very, very small amounts of water, those ice deposits
        - STUDENT, you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon
        - Within within the actual text
        - What does NASA send to the moon to actually investigate for the water on the moon
        - but this is there anything that they would take with them to possibly try to investigate and sort of study the water on the moon with them
        - you would definitely, they are microscopic so if it was on earth you would definitely need a microscope to visually look at the water,
        - but within the maybe perhaps the second paragraph, it says, you know what they sent with the astronauts to investigate the water on the moon
        - But you can't use those to sort of discover water on the moon
        - And so, I mean, for example, a small machine could sort of, I mean that could be anything, you know, from maybe even a remote car to even a clock on the wall
        - But what what tool or piece of equipment, would they actually did the scientists used to perhaps find that water on the moon within the craters
        - Do you need water to live on Earth
        - you know, this technology will, you know, sort of be needed to be expanded upon going forward
        - But let's say for example the do you need
        - Every time that you know you need to go into spaces is pretty expensive
        - Um, it would be very expensive
        - Okay, well, good job, for sure
        - But if one day we are able to, you know, perhaps, expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me
        - They might actually help out astronauts?
        - This can STUDENT does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon
        - Just because we don't really have STUDENT there but
        - Yes, yes, it's so you are correct
        - Currently, like, like you said, as for right now is, you know, not very valuable
        - Is there enough evidence
        - But do you think perhaps, like you said, perhaps in the future
        - You know, you know, at least going forward
        - If it were to have some type of, you know, human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there
        - You know, we human beings breathe oxygen
        - And perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon
        - Chris you STUDENT are on the same page
        - Hopefully soon but maybe you know further along in the future
        - You both have come up with the same evidence that perhaps you know like, like you said, if we were able to ever have someone living on the moon
        - And that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water, even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon
        - Okay, why did you circle equipment
        - And why did you circle discover
        - Okay, let's talk about evidence
        - What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be STUDENT
        - Like, we're looking for proof, what are we looking for proof for proof of what?
        - And we're going to discover evidence and proof
        - So, what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon
        - Did you tell me that our plants need water to survive, is that correct?
        - How did you know that water's heavy
        - What is it you know about space
        - You're talking about space
        - Alright, so what we were talking about your, your article or your passage, it was what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - And why we use that for? To look at what? To look at things
        - STUDENT But let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon
        - Now I did notice Farrah and STUDENT had the same response
        - Okay, so that sounds good
        - So let's go back and look at our responses here
        - So which one of you would like to explain your response
        - and STUDENT, is that where you found your evidence as well?
        - And so that's very good, STUDENT
        - Okay, so they they can't see it without the microscope
        - Now, how do you think they originally were able to get the water though? Remember we're seeing how they discovered water on the moon
        - And where did you see that at?
        - Okay, they sent a small machine
        - Do you think sometimes maybe it's we can be a little more specific
        - Okay, so when we answer something
        - That way there's no confusion
        - So you, how do you think if we took your answer
        - They send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about
        - So we could say what machine is and what, what was the machine here that was being used?
        - So, what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this STUDENT, though
        - Okay, so I STUDENT so you think are you know a lot about space
        - and then do you remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter what it was doing
        - To address STUDENT question, I would just like to clarify
        - So when we talk about NASA here were first of STUDENT two things, you know, we're talking specifically about the scientists here
        - So not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space, physically, but also the scientist on the ground
        - It says what equipment that scientists and then can you finish the question
        - And we're looking specifically at the equipment, if we if we pay close attention to the question I want you to read after me
        - So we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what Harrion?
        - And I want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon
        - So the reason why we're looking back over your answers
        - When we look back over the text in paragraph two, um, what, what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's one type of equipment
        - What else did they do with the equipment
        - but I want to dig a little bit deeper into the question and let's figure out exactly what they're talking about and see a we can expand on some of the ideas that STUDENT
        - Write down for your answers
        - Does STUDENT here know what the word equipment means
        - Those are STUDENT types of equipment
        - And so what about the word discover
        - Do we STUDENT know what the word discover means
        - So our question is asking what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon
        - Excellent Harris and that is when you find something
        - So when looking at the paragraph, um,
        - I know that there are two words that
        - Students get confused and that's microscope and so microscope is a top of tool that we use to see different
        - And then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it
        - That we need to expand upon some of the answers
        - The difference is the microscope is the tool that they use to see the microscopic pieces so microscope is the tool that they use
        - They do talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph
        - And then microscopic is the, um,
        - It's a form of the microscopic ice
        - So when we look at our paragraph
        - If we're looking at paragraph
        - No, excuse me, paragraph to
        - It talks about that
        - Do you, do you see the name I'm looking through the paragraph
        - What did the lunar orbiter do
        - So we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate
        - It's in the large polar crater
        - They saw the US deposit
        - What details that it gave about they asked deposits
        - So they use the Lord the Lunar Orbiter to to to
        - Investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small
        - We know that we have the Lunar Orbiter and that it's used to
        - That that NASA is using this to form the ice deposits
        - Or to investigate the ice deposits, but
        - And they did use a scientific tool called a microscope, but the microscope
        - What did it show us
        - So what does microscopic mean what does it tell us
        - We can't see it with our
        - Okay, so it's really, really, really, really, really, really small
        - So let's think about putting STUDENT of these things that we know together, we know that we're going to use the microscope to look at the microscopic us
        - We know that the
        - So we're going to put STUDENT of this together
        - Right, that we found on the moon
        - Does STUDENT remember what it was used to do
        - And it was in what form
        - Okay, so what's confusing you STUDENT
        - So when we look at, paragraph two,
        - We know that NASA sent the small machine
        - The Lunar Orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do
        - OK, so the lunar orbiter is going to investigate the US deposits
        - The third and fourth sentence is that information that we really know to answer need to know to answer this question
        - Okay, so we know that NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - We know that the water they found it was what
        - And where was the microscopic us at
        - And it was what did it do
        - Um, can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine
        - Okay, so what is, what is that thing
        - What do you know about microscopes
        - How is it used on the moon
        - So we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine
        - First, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter?
        - So I guess back to Farrahs question
        - So which one do you want to focus on
        - So how, so we've identified the equipment
        - How do they use this equipment to look and discover water
        - So what in that paragraph STUDENT, what is that telling us about the microscope?
        - What does that tell you about the water
        - And if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon
        - So what does that tell you about the water on the moon
        - Is there a lot of it
        - Well, does it pertain to our article?
        - So you're talking about some equipment that they needed or that you knew happen on the moon
        - So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter
        - Do you know what a polar crater is
        - Is can you imagine
        - The Lunar Orbiter landing at the moon South Pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon
        - Based on what you just read what do you think about the, what is the point of the microscope
        - Are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article
        - So to answer your question, STUDENT and deaf so far
        - Whenever we're talking about the equipment that scientists use the key word in this question is to discover water on the moon
        - It's not the question is not asking necessarily about
        - The way they found the water because the water is very small
        - The key word is
        - It's asking the machine or the equipment that is used to discover the water
        - Discover a microscope helps you study the water, whereas the lunar orbiter helps you
        - You can do some cool stuff with it and STUDENT actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it
        - Who's the they that you're talking about
        - Okay, so that could be a benefit of having water
        - So let's talk more about that
        - The astronauts and so water is very heavy on
        - and how do you know this
        - Or it's very cumbersome for astronauts
        - I'm glad you know that, but it's also in the text
        - Could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me
        - And water is heavy
        - And because that water is heavy, it would definitely be a benefit if you know astronauts could
        - You know, use what's already there instead of have to take up stuff with him in the spaceships, because it's very heavy and like I said very cumbersome
        - Well, let's focus on the text
        - The second part, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So I see first
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But again, we're focusing on the equipment, the scientists use
        - So the the question itself establishes that there's water on the moon
        - So yes, just like if you can't breathe oxygen, you're going to need an oxygen tank
        - But really, a better answer would be, since it says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon is what equipment are they actually using to discover water
        - Kind of like if you're playing basketball
        - For an organized sport, you're probably going to need a jersey right to play
        - But the important tool is the basketball itself
        - We look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon, what are we really looking for
        - So now when we look at your answer was oxygen tanks, is that the equipment they used to discover water
        - It's new to whoever finds it
        - We go back into the text, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - So then that that is also true NASA send a small machine
        - And then also, um, so when I'm talking to you
        - I'm gonna say STUDENT
        - So if we go back to the question what equipment that scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - What is that question asking?
        - We're just looking for what equipment led them to finding those Craters of water
        - So this is an argument piece
        - But if we look at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be value
        - So you can say yes it is valuable, or no, it is not valuable
        - It sounds like you think, yes
        - Yes you do say yes answers
        - So you go yes and you're very use think strongly about it
        - So that's fine that that you think that um, because this is, it's what you believe
        - So you put no, not for a long time
        - So you're saying no
        - Is there and convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Just go back and reread number four
        - That might change your answer
        - But if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four
        - It's, you just need to support it
        - They don't have to Carry it in the ships anymore
        - And you read that in the text, that's fine
        - Okay, so you are talking about bringing water so that might imply that water on the moon can be very valuable
        - Can STUDENT give me another word for equipment?
        - Does STUDENT take a second to look back in the text and tell me what equipment
        - Well, first of all, can STUDENT tell me what equipment means
        - So we're going to, let's look back in the texts and see what equipment was talked about
        - Absolutely, you are on the right track
        - Okay, so let's look back in the text
        - Let's read it says let's reread the text quickly
        - It says, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places, wherever, or where the sun never shines
        - That's our key word STUDENT
        - Can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does
        - NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Can you tell us what do you think?
        - Okay, so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do, based on our reading
        - So I see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon STUDENT?
        - So I see we have our answers are a microscope, A small machine and then we have some other equipment
        - Let's look at back at some of our answers
        - So I see that we have
        - You STUDENT put some really great work in and had some good answer choices, but I don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking, So firstly, what I want to do is
        - Okay, so first I want to make sure that we have a clear understanding of what the question is actually asking so
        - So can STUDENT give me a synonym for the word equipment
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - First of STUDENT, I want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means
        - In the texts that are going to talk about equipment
        - So first of all, we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what STUDENT
        - Now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage
        - So, STUDENT that you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - So what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment
        - Let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine
        - Go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included
        - Can you be more specific
        - About that small machine
        - What was that called
        - Now the STUDENT has found the sentence that told us the lunar orbiter was the machine that helped the scientists discover water
        - So we had a couple people think that we were looking for microscope
        - Some of our other answers
        - In why microscope wasn't the best choice
        - Let's look back in the text
        - So let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope
        - Then we want to look and see which one's the best
        - Would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us, please
        - So we are on the first page in paragraph number three
        - Okay, so are they saying, Is there any evidence in that paragraph that leads you to believe that that's something that was used
        - Or something that you would need to use to look really closely
        - Out of water, they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool, but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it
        - because the microscope was a tool
        - Okay, so what can you restate that question, what is that question asking what are the some important words, STUDENT, I want you guys to
        - turn and talk or take a second to really look at the question and see what exactly how else could you ask
        - what that question is
        - Asking, What are those important words
        - So specifically, it says, what kinds of equipment
        - So what kind of things
        - So first of STUDENT, I want to make sure
        - So can you give me
        - I don't think we fully understand equipment so equipment is what we're going to be looking for equipment that helps the scientists discover water on the moon
        - Because I think, judging by some of your responses
        - Another example of a word for equipment, STUDENT
        - What does it mean, what does it
        - So let's look it specifically we want to look through our passage and make sure that we're looking for equipment that helped
        - So let's look so STUDENT, you said that the small machine
        - The scientists find water on the moon
        - Was the equipment that you think help the scientists and STUDENT
        - So we're looking so we've narrowed it down
        - I want you STUDENT to take a second to locate
        - We have our small machine
        - In the text where you found small machine and microscope, and I want you STUDENT to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope
        - Okay, so go ahead and locate that as well
        - Let's look at microscope
        - Did you find where we can find microscope and and there
        - Okay, so did it say that they used a microscope
        - It said you need
        - So you'd a contraction for you would need
        - So that makes sense that to be able, they're saying to look really closely at the water, you would need that tool
        - But how did they discover it or another word
        - How did they find that water
        - So the only other piece of equipment in the text is a small machine called
        - So, so we know that ice is the water
        - Okay, so that's very good
        - We're going to keep that in the back of our brains
        - We know that the water that we find is very small
        - So where we're thinking about how small the water is
        - Can you tell me why you chose Lunar Orbiter
        - So when you say the small machine
        - Are you talking about the Lunar Orbiter, or the microscope?
        - Okay, so we have lunar orbiter again
        - Do you know that phrase
        - And what do you know, have you heard the word lunar orbiter before
        - Do you know what a microscope is
        - So we know Chris oh sorry Oliver and STUDENT, let us know that we need a microscope to see the water on the moon
        - So, very good, very good
        - What do you think the most important word in that question is
        - So we are looking specifically for equipment
        - And so when we look at our text, we're trying to find the thing that helps us discover the water or find the water
        - Right so discover is our most important word in that question
        - Right? So the microscope does help us see the water
        - But what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place
        - And what is one thing that you know about space that can help us
        - Hold your thought we're going to get to your, your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space
        - My question for you is, what other equipment does our article say that scientists use to discover water right because we also need water in order to survive in space
        - Why do you think equipment is the most important word
        - Why do you think water is the most important question or word
        - So we have water we have equipment
        - And I think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title
        - So can STUDENT summarize this article and tell me what water and equipment have, how did they work together in this article
        - We know that we have to use oxygen in space
        - And see what equipment we use before the microscope
        - And so, specifically in paragraph two, we have NASA sending not humans out because they need so much oxygen, but a different tool
        - So you did point out that NASA a small machine, but a microscope is a small machine, right
        - And we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water, which, in turn, we use the microscope, because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon
        - Why the microscope is not the answer
        - We already know about the different types of equipment what keyword
        - Okay, so let's look at our question
        - Again, we have what equipment we used
        - In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment
        - The question uses the word discover which is the same as find
        - So what we need to look at in our, in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time, right
        - So it comes first in the story
        - And then we use the microscope to identify the water
        - And if there's evidence for and water not being valuable
        - I'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable
        - So looking at Question two
        - And what do you have figured out
        - My question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable, even if it can be split
        - What can we use those two parts for would be my question to you
        - So you're absolutely right
        - We can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own, which we use for what
        - We can also use the oxygen for breathing
        - STUDENT, we can use the water for drinking
        - But there are other ways in which we can use this water that's found on the moon
        - So I want STUDENT to look at paragraph five, and see how else we can use The water on the moon
        - Now how STUDENT, do you, can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go
        - Do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts
        - What are you confused about
        - And I like your reasoning there because it's going to take time and money that that it would be difficult to get right now
        - Alright so what I'm asking you is based on the ways we can use water do you think it is worth  Investing in
        - Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon
        - Why do you think it is a valuable resource STUDENT
        - Can you think of any other reasons why water would be a valuable resource because based on what we've talked about today
        - And I think breathing and staying alive in space is very important
        - Right, so we can use it to breathe as well
        - Oh, STUDENT, would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down
        - That would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon, then that means what, what do you think that would mean
        - We've already said it's valuable and we can put a moon base on the moon, then that means the water that we found can be used directly on the moon, which means what
        - Yeah, so if we if we can find water and use it
        - If we can refill up on the moon
        - What do you think that would mean
        - I think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do STUDENT these different things, especially if we can put a moon base on the moon
        - So I think, I think you STUDENT have it
        - And we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence
        - Yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer
        - It says that the whole time throughout the article
        - Okay so water is important, but how many since the article is about water
        - Yeah, I agree, equipment and discover are two very important keywords for our question number one
        - and I know that some people had mentioned microscope are being microscopic
        - Okay, so now that we know that we're looking for equipment that discovered it,
        - So that is in Question or paragraph number two, or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope
        - But let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope
        - I do like that you what you changed your answer to
        - And we're going to hang out
        - We're going to help other people in this STUDENT use that same thought process
        - And so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer
        - Yes, I noticed that you changed your answer
        - So once you've discovered it
        - now STUDENT in your answer in your response you named a type of machine
        - And now you can look at it
        - So the microscope is what's looking at it
        - Now you found it
        - Yeah so found and discover they play hand in hand with each other
        - What was that machine
        - Where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that?
        - Yeah, say, STUDENT said that she found her answer in paragraph two
        - STUDENT, What do you have to say
        - Keywords something important to help us find it back in the text
        - So we are going to use the same strategy, the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question
        - So we know what headings are in our text
        - The first heading is the moon is a desert
        - It's the bolted words, who can read to me what the second heading is
        - So there are two headings here
        - Have we already found from this heading
        - So what key word from our question
        - We're trying to find those words back in the text, so that we know what answer to give
        - Okay, so when we are reading our question and we have found those keywords
        - Is that the only paragraph that provides us with convincing evidence?
        - No? where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence
        - What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen
        - How are they going to use the hydrogen?
        - So did they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - Did people go up on the moon, though
        - Did people go up on the moon in this article, what we just read
        - Did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article
        - What's the word in that question that gives you a hint at where to look in the passage
        - Is there a title of that machine
        - Is there a name of that machine in number two?
        - You are welcome and, STUDENT, you looked at, found craters full of water on the moon
        - Where did you get your answer from, STUDENT
        - Yeah, and after number one where you got your answer, did you read the rest of the response
        - The rest of the article?
        - Yeah, so, STUDENT, you talked about the microscope
        - Where did you find your answer?
        - Was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it, or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope
        - Yeah, so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment, but is that what they used on the moon
        - Can you tell me some facts from the story that we read?
        - Do you know what people are called when they go to space, like what is their job title
        - But what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space
        - STUDENT, what made you come up with your answer choice
        - How did you come up with that answer
        - STUDENT, when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon
        - Okay, so if we go back and we look at this reading passage, does STUDENT know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions
        - What key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question
        - STUDENT when you hear the word equipment, what comes to mind
        - Good, so we can take the word equipment and we know that equipment means a physical object
        - And then we need to find the equipment
        - So when we're reading the passage and looking for this answer we know that we want to find physical objects that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - We know that water has been found on the moon
        - So when we read this passage
        - So as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind
        - So when we're reading and we know that we want to look for equipment
        - Okay well we're going to work on reading comprehension in this STUDENT
        - So now that you've had time to share with the person beside you
        - I would like for one person in each group to share their answers with the group so Farrah and Deb, you want to view, give me what words you STUDENT underlying the question
        - What words did you STUDENT underline
        - I like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two key words to help us answer this question, Chris and STUDENT
        - Why did you underline discover
        - That's correct discover is the verb that is going to help us answer this question
        - So the equipment used to discover that is how you know what type of equipment you wanted to find so
        - Well, that's why it's important that we know the action which is discover water on the moon
        - So we can look back in our texts and find where it talks about a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - And in the text it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Can you point to it
        - Can you show me where it says that in the text
        - STUDENT, you had a question on you were wondering why your answer wasn't the best answer correct
        - So, do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer
        - So today I want us to work on finding
        - keywords in questions to help us better answer questions
        - STUDENT What key words, could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer
        - Is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question
        - I like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline, you are correct
        - Discover and equipment are two very important question or two very important words in this question
        - Okay guys, so let's come back together as a STUDENT
        - I like how you said discovered that is correct
        - Can one of you tell me what words you STUDENT underline
        - That may not in depth
        - It's wanting to know a piece of equipment that scientists did use and then discover is our action word
        - So those are two correct words that you would want to underline in that question because the equipment
        - To help us answer this question
        - How could you be more specific and answering your and your answer
        - So if you look back in the text and paragraph two, it says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - How could you be more specific in your answer
        - Teacherr So how could you look back
        - To find that answer
        - Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer
        - So I saw responses and STUDENT
        - My question for you just, you said that you sort of the same thing is STUDENT
        - So can you explain how you also got the same answer for me
        - So I think that if we are able to work together and kind of pull their resources in there, we can come up with the right answer
        - I think that's what it's mainly asking
        - Okay, so we STUDENT did
        - So we know that scientists discovered water on the moon
        - So we know that part already
        - So now we get to figure out with the equipment was
        - What does that mean that the water is microscopic
        - What do you need to see the water
        - And so from the passage STUDENT
        - So talking about equipment that can be anything from a microscope to a giant rocket or anything
        - So I think what might help us is to maybe, you know, over the passage, a little bit
        - I think specifically part to see if we can STUDENT find the passage
        - And what was that small machine called
        - Why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon
        - So you had both mentioned the fact that water is found in STUDENT You had mentioned equipment they had been used
        - One question for you STUDENT
        - So from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage
        - What were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage
        - What do you say that
        - How was the water described in the passage
        - How small was it
        - And so, so we know the water, the water is there
        - I mean, STUDENT you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon
        - So if the water is microscopic STUDENT, can we just see it from, let's say, a lunar orbiter above the above the moon, or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment
        - Yeah, so I guess STUDENT also soften your answer
        - So according to that passage STUDENT, what is the what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water
        - So the question what equipment did scientists use this river water on the moon
        - It's asking from the passionate itself
        - We're all going to be in the STUDENT to learn together and discuss what we read
        - STUDENT, they used the microscope to look closely at it, but what did they send to the moon?
        - Let's see what paragraph three says, Uh, maybe we can discuss the difference
        - We're just having a STUDENT discussion now that we've read
        - So STUDENT after, after reading, paragraph three, do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes?
        - STUDENT You said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks
        - What are they using that for
        - So if we look back at the question, what do you think the key words in the question are
        - Does STUDENT want to share what they circled
        - I like that you Circle the word equipment that will really help you find in the passage, what the answer
        - I like that you circled the word equipment, just like STUDENT because that'll help find the answer in the passage will have to look for the word equipment and see if you can find the correct answer
        - I like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the Moon
        - Did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling The key word in the question?
        - The what the designed to send to the moon to find the water do you can you find that in the text
        - What did they use to find the water
        - But before they could use the microscope
        - What did they use to get to the moon
        - Can STUDENT go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called?
        - Right now we're looking to find what equipment they used to find the water on the moon
        - But that's not what we're looking for
        - Did you look back in the text using your keywords
        - I'm so how did you find that answer
        - So I want STUDENT to take a second go into the reading and circle where you found your answer
        - Where did you find in the text to support your answer
        - And STUDENT, would you like to go, let us know how you found your answer
        - So that was two of the ways that they could use it
        - And as the fuel if they break it into two parts
        - So the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink
        - Farrah, did you Farrah and STUDENT
        - Were you able to find in the in the paragraph, where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes
        - I agree, but we're reading the paragraphs and we're wondering what based off of our paragraphs, what knowledge, are we getting from those
        - Why did you underline that in paragraph two
        - STUDENT why did you underline that I'm paragraph two,
        - Because the lunar orbiter helps with the ice right? And the ice helps
        - Um, STUDENT, how did you come up with your answer
        - So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT Where did you come up with your answer
        - STUDENT, what do you have to say about your answer
        - Okay well we're all put in this STUDENT to help each other learn, um,
        - Do you think that your answer answers the question, STUDENT
        - Well, let's look at our texts and figure it out together
        - So in paragraph two, it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So STUDENT, do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope
        - Your text doesn't say if there are astronauts does it
        - Okay, I'm going to start with STUDENT Farrah, you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely, what made you say a microscope Farrah
        - So could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks
        - But right now we're looking to see how they found the water
        - What equipment, help them discover the water on the moon
        - and STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Could you tell me maybe what small machine or where you found that in the expert, except of the story
        - You said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon
        - Let's look at yours
        - Could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer
        - So could you explain to me where you come up with your answer
        - Let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as STUDENT
        - They did need the microscope as Farrah, and STUDENT mentioned
        - What helped them found the water was the Lunar Orbiter
        - But that doesn't help them find the water
        - To be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye, you needed the microscope to be able to really
        - So they did use other pieces of equipment to help them, but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the Lunar Orbiter
        - Zoom in and see it
        - You know the name of that machine they sent?
        - Okay, so, STUDENT, you said NASA sent a small machine
        - Why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two, and can you tell me the name of the machine that they sent that NASA sent
        - However, STUDENT, do you see in the paragraph, where it talks about the machine that they sent
        - Okay, let's look at paragraph two,
        - So what do we think STUDENT microscopic means
        - So the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely
        - So the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it
        - There's a small amount of it
        - So it did help them find the water and they would need the microscope to look very closely at the water because it's so microscopic, it's so little and such a small amount
        - Wrapped if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it, then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount
        - So they did send them lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely, they would need the microscope
        - And it seems like we have some understanding of what it is that we're trying to find out
        - So what I'd like to do is I'd like us to go around and read this little by little, one person at a time and then we're going to work through this question together
        - But we're not STUDENT quite there just yet
        - In a moment after our answer Farrahs question I'd like us to go through and identify some of these words, STUDENT, what's your question?
        - Now while I'm reading this, I see a lot of words that maybe I do, maybe I do not quite understand
        - Or maybe just need some clarification, take just a moment, raise your hand when you find one
        - So look at this for just a moment on your own and see if you can find one or two words that maybe you don't entirely know what they mean
        - What do you believe it means
        - Alright, so we have identified the word microscopic
        - The question is this
        - Now I'm going to reread the question once more, just so we get it back into our heads
        - But is that STUDENT we use to get there and be able to observe said water?
        - Absolutely they did use that to get to the moon, didn't they? But really could they have seen such tiny amounts of water without the microscope as well
        - I love that amount of enthusiasm, real quick before we begin, I would like to just address one thing that I tell STUDENT of my students Whenever they walk into my classroom for the first time
        - One thing I like to mention to my students that I'd like to mention to STUDENT of you as well as my philosophy on answering questions might be a weird thing to hear at this age, but I'd like mistakes
        - That's a weird thing to hear a teacher, save right I like mistakes, you're probably not going to hear too many say make mistakes in my STUDENT
        - In fact, STUDENT look back in the text and see where you found your answer and help me understand what what it was that led you to that conclusion when we get to each person
        - Look back in your text and help me understand what led you to that conclusion
        - What made you say you need it scientifically tool called the microscope
        - Now, do me a favor
        - Have you found it
        - To go ahead and read me where it is in the passage
        - What does that mean, STUDENT
        - That's one of the words that pops out to me
        - We actually can't see it, just looking at it, can we, so we do indeed need that microscope comes from the word microscopic microscope to be able to see it
        - Yeah, and that's exactly why I pause for just a moment because you both do have the same answer
        - So you have the same answer As STUDENT
        - You do use a microscope to actually see the water
        - So I'd like to dress you both at the same time
        - helped me look back, I'm looking at
        - I don't think it quite is
        - But is that STUDENT that they used in order to find the water
        - Let me scroll up if you look back direct quote from it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate you read the rest of the paragraph, it leads them to the water right?
        - If you look back
        - Help me understand what led you to your conclusion
        - Do me a favor, go back into the text
        - Did you find the information about the crater
        - Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph
        - However, if we look at paragraph two it goes a little bit more in depth, from what I see
        - So let's look specifically at paragraph number two, both of them mentioned craters
        - is that a lot of water STUDENT
        - So if we look back down at your answer, which was there, full of water on the moon
        - Is that completely accurate
        - And if we go back
        - So it's really, really small and spread over a really large area
        - It actually says that we need a microscope to see the water
        - So your answer was that they use oxygen tanks, essentially, is what your answer was
        - So, would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me, while you're looking
        - So if we go back up and we see that
        - However, if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's our buzzword right there, discover the water
        - More specifically, that you're looking at it and actually seeing it in order to see it, you would need to have already discovered it by this point, right
        - If we look at the microscope
        - Help me, help me with yours
        - I asked you to find where you found your information in the text
        - Where'd you see it
        - So we know that they sent up that small machine and STUDENT, we know that we have to use a microscope to actually see the water
        - And STUDENT, you mentioned that they did use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So I think you STUDENT are on the right track with that and then Chris and Luis, you guys agreed that there was other equipment used
        - Yeah, so um in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, and basically look for these ice deposits, and since the water was so small, we then have to use a microscope to see it
        - So what made you choose those two words
        - So it looks like so far, Farrah, and STUDENT
        - Okay, that's a good job
        - You STUDENT have both talked about equipment
        - So the three of you STUDENT have chosen equipment as a key term which is really good because it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water
        - You also said that discover and investigate were really similar
        - And although it was microscopic
        - Um, let's see what NASA sent to the moon and if there any other equipment pieces that you guys think are really important STUDENT, would you like to add something
        - And let's see how our answers may have changed, based on your STUDENT discussion
        - Guys, let's bring it back together as a as one STUDENT
        - How do you STUDENT think you could reconstruct your answer to be just a little bit more detailed
        - I want to ask you guys after you've talked to your partners or your STUDENT members and we circled are underlined key terms in the text and in your questions
        - And now that you've added the name you've definitely added more detail
        - So I think that you're on the right track because they did send a small machine
        - And I want to make sure that STUDENT has a really good understanding of why it was the lunar orbiter that helped us discover the microscopic water
        - I think that um, you know, earlier we discussed how discover and investigate were two really big key terms in the question and the article,
        - Okay, well, we do want to focus your attention on the article we just read and we're going to examine this article and try to determine how scientists have gone about finding water and the craters on the moon
        - Does this text actually support that idea that you need a microscope find water on the moon
        - And that and what do you think about that
        - And what part of that passage do you see that reference that you need a microscope?
        - Why do you think they need to work real closely at the water that's on the moon
        - And you type in your answer, you said they need the microscope to look real closely
        - What is it about the water on the moon that necessitates the fact that they need to look closely at it
        - And why can't you see it with your eyes?
        - What is it about water
        - That's going to make tiny objects appear large
        - So, you know, you think about water on Earth
        - We STUDENT need a microscope
        - We look at ponds, lakes, oceans, we can see that water
        - But on the line as conveyed in that passage, we can see that the water is small and we need this microscope to make it appear large and that's the purpose of the microscope
        - So, good job there
        - That's exactly why we need it because we cannot see the water that's in these craters
        - They need a small machine
        - Could you elaborate on that, what exactly do you mean by a small machine
        - And go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine
        - They do need a small machine and, more specifically, as you just said in paragraph two, we can see they send a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter in this case
        - And what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked, and the text that you read
        - I'd like you to focus on just the microscopes, does it mentioned in the text that the microscope was used to find water on the moon
        - Why did you say microscopes in relation to that question
        - However, I do want you to look at that part of the text again and ask yourself
        - Was the microscope used to find water on the moon?
        - Remember, he uses a microscope
        - Humans look through a microscope right scientists look through a microscope
        - Were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits
        - However, scientists were not on the moon
        - If a human or a scientist wanted to see those water deposits, they don't have to use a microscope
        - Was there a piece of equipment referenced in the text that was on the moon, and STUDENT get to in just a minute
        - What was on the moon
        - Was there a piece of equipment that was mentioned on the moon?
        - Scientists are going to be using a lot of equipment when they go to the moon
        - So I would like you to do STUDENT is go back to the text
        - You know, they found water in the moon, you know, they found it in the craters and that's great
        - I want you to ask yourself what equipment, did they send into the craters to find that water as on the moon
        - Why is that valuable that it can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen
        - And what was your thinking when you said that is your answer
        - Why does that make water valuable
        - So your initial answer kind of got started on that process
        - You said it can be split the oxygen, hydrogen
        - But why can't take a spring water with them
        - Could the astronauts, you just bring in the water with them
        - and why does that make it valuable
        - What do you say,
        - What's your thinking there
        - You did kind of explain that you said that they need water
        - But it's even more valuable because they
        - They could, but it's going to take up too much space and that when you go into the moon
        - Can't really bring that water with them
        - You know, you need to save as much space as you can
        - And it takes a lot of money to get stuff up to the moon
        - So, the less weight, I can turn that rocket the more money I'm going to save
        - The fact that it's on the moon means they don't have to carry it on the rocket and that does make it extremely valuable right
        - So you have mentioned something that is valuable, they can
        - Is there anything else in the text that you can add of why water might be valuable
        - What else is valuable
        - They don't have to put that water on the rocket
        - As a stage to go further into the solar system like Mars
        - And you're absolutely right
        - So they're going to need fuel, they're going to need oxygen, they're going to need hydrogen
        - Water can be used to make those fuels and that can be used for that base, they might potentially build
        - Okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet?
        - So you're right that water isn't ready yet
        - Like what you've done, you got to that last paragraph, where it says that scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting the water
        - They're going to have to Oliverelop a plan to extract water so it can be used
        - And but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have, yes STUDENT
        - Do you remember what that machine was
        - Well, do you think that you could maybe find what machine you're talking about inside your text
        - What is the microscope D
        - Who don't want an orbiter
        - What did it say that we did with it
        - Are you STUDENT thinking that we're going to be looking for a big pond of water or are we going to be looking for water that is extremely small
        - If you have that machine and you have a microscope
        - Are you going to see water that is in large areas or are we looking for little bitty areas of water is a main full of water
        - So do you think based off of what you STUDENT just told me that
        - They do use those and article even talks about using those different things
        - When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water
        - It's are we going to look at large bodies of water
        - Is the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        - The reason why you have to use a microscope, you can't see it with your naked eye
        - Right, so we're looking at microscopic micro being small
        - They use other equipment to like oxygen tanks and there's another one
        - but STUDENT, you brought up a great point
        - Do you STUDENT remember what the other equipment that they used
        - Why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon
        - What were those two parts that you said
        - Water on the moon be valuable
        - And I love how you STUDENT are trying to think about this
        - Both of these things up
        - So let me help you with this
        - You're telling me that I can split
        - To us and help benefit the astronauts when they go to the moon
        - We do drink water because we have to have it for our bodies, but we breathe oxygen
        - STUDENT You said that those two elements are can be broken apart
        - Think about them being separate now so your water molecules are now broken apart
        - You're left with hydrogen and oxygen
        - What can the astronaut use
        - Okay, well, what do we know that the moon doesn't have
        - What are we trying to make by STUDENT tanks and Luis's two elements
        - What did you just breathe in
        - But guess what the moon does not have
        - So is it going to have a moon garden
        - Is it going to be very heavy
        - But think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy
        - So, hmm, is this patient, very large
        - Maybe, but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there
        - So do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon
        - I would tell you
        - Okay, so, um, Miss STUDENT, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - What do you know about a microscope
        - And, and then I loved and STUDENT, you said that there was craters full of water on the moon
        - Can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon?
        - Okay, so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like
        - How are you picturing it
        - And STUDENT told us that microscopic means you have to look through a microscope to see it, meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - So, what did you guys see in your mind when I read that? STUDENT?
        - Yeah, I like that
        - Do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said?
        - STUDENT, do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there
        - They did send a small machine, but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for
        - Okay, so we're going to, I was coming to you, Miss STUDENT, and you said that they sent a small machine
        - But is that the only thing that they sent, the only thing that they used
        - They will if, as if an astronaut went to the moon, they definitely would have to, but when we look at this, this text, do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon, or was it machines
        - Now the question is asking for the tool that we use for this
        - Does anybody, STUDENT have the specific name of the machine?
        - Okay, so yes, they used a small machine
        - But if you look closely at the question, it was asking what the tool was to get that sample,  your answer was the tools to see it
        - Well, you had the right idea about the microscope about the microscopic water molecules
        - If you look back at the discussion question it's looking for the specific tool or Oliverice specifically used for that purpose
        - But this is also why science questions are a little tricky
        - Each each Oliverice has a particular purpose it is designed for, for example, like you said the oxygen tanks
        - The question was looking for the specific Oliverice us to find that one doesn't mean that STUDENT the other stuff is a used, it just means that's not the is the specific item that they were looking for
        - But is that the specific Oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples?
        - Right, so they used to help people to breathe air, to breathe in space
        - Would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer?
        - Could you share with the STUDENT The section that mentioned this tool
        - What would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text
        - We are focusing on the specific action of locating water
        - Now for this particular article that we're looking at
        - And this is one of those tools that you probably saw at NASA STUDENT when you went to go visit
        - Now we've talked about how we we have this small lunar module
        - This lunar module again just like STUDENT said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters
        - This would help them find water
        - You want to explain that?
        - So you're thinking, we may not have the technology yet
        - Do you want to describe where in the text you found this?
        - And now, what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen
        - There's a clue in paragraph five, yes STUDENT
        - Going back to your first statement so transporting it would be something that we would have to do
        - It is very heavy
        - now, Farrah, and Oliver you STUDENT mentioned that during our discussion that the technology might not be ready for that yet but however there are some possibilities that we can use water
        - This question in particular is asking is there is there convincing evidence of water alone can be valuable
        - Yes, we do have some Olivereloping to do with the technology to be able to move and transport the water and to split those chemicals up to form the rocket fuel
        - There are a lot of uses for water
        - Day now is the technology ready
        - I would say I would say probably no
        - But there are some uses that we could use water for in the future, even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen
        - You might find something that you didn't know
        - Well, guess what we're going to learn some new things today
        - A small machine can you you know what that small machine called?
        - Can you go back in the text and fine what that small machine is called?
        - So let's look back in the story and see if we can find those tools
        - So there's two tools
        - can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called
        - So we're going to look back and we're going to see if we can find it in the text
        - Let's look back in the text and see if we can find the answer to our question
        - So let's look back and see what we can find
        - So let's see if we can find the answer in our story
        - And then, paragraph three, this is where STUDENT got her answer
        - Do you remember what the name of that small machine was
        - I just would like the answer what the machine is called
        - But it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is even
        - Maybe we can take a closer look at the reading to and get some other feedback
        - The point in this group was to just elaborate more on you STUDENT
        - So did you hear the beginning of what you said there was a specific name of a little tool that they used to investigate in water
        - Yeah, so that was definitely
        - It was a form of a microscope
        - It was a small machine
        - I'm sure that they didn't use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like STUDENT said, but there was that one little piece in the text that gave the specific name of the tool
        - This question was specifically looking for
        - Do you think that they would use both parts one part, what do you think?
        - STUDENT, you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon
        - let's think about oxygen
        - yeah so you STUDENT kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there
        - No, we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you STUDENT got your answers from
        - Well we're STUDENT gonna collectively talk to each other, if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well, you guys could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it
        - Not for a long time, why do you think not, for a long time
        - that's definitely an aspect of it
        - um So do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts
        - it's kind of a two part question, if you think about it, because you're weighing out what would be valuable about the water to the astronauts like
        - mm hmm so you and STUDENT had the same idea
        - Jazmin and Luis and Chris brought up the idea of oxygen and you need water, but then you and STUDENT thought about what it would take to get that so you, your opinion on it is whether or not it would be worth it to do it
        - And so, some would say yes, and some people would be no
        - For what I'm kind of hoping from you is that you search them a text and kind of show me what you learned from the text
        - Does that sound good
        - So for this STUDENT, we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading
        - We did read that
        - It's called a Moon, lunar orbiter
        - And that it investigates so that's why NASA sends it up there
        - tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying, I just wanted you STUDENT to use examples exactly from the text that way
        - I know that you STUDENT had an easy time reading
        - Okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups, and if you know a lot about space, then maybe you can help your table mates that, we probably don't know as much as you do
        - It sounds good to you, STUDENT?
        - good to hear so today I put you on a STUDENT because we're going to focus on today's lesson which is about scientific tools that are used on the moon
        - and other than that we're going to talk about whether the moon has valuable resources for people to be able to live on the moon
        - There was a short reading and I gave you guys two questions, just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you guys, the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, yes STUDENT
        - Okay we'll just work on question number one, thank you for letting me know so did you STUDENT will be time to write down your answers to questions
        - Okay, so when you say NASA send a small machine, do you know what the name of it was?
        - , maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for? Do you remember?
        - So you're both right because we read three different parts of the text where they talked about two different equipments that are used on the moon
        - The lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon, and the microscope like STUDENT said is used to look at small particles, that the Lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things
        - yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope
        - So you could always write that to that, even though scientists use a microscope there might be so some things that are so small, they still can't see
        - STUDENT these tools contribute to scientists being able to discover if the moon is truly habitable, which means that people can live there for humans like us
        - Usually, they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon, try to see if anyone from earth can be able to live in the moon, yes STUDENT
        - But I want to kind of make it a little more clear for STUDENT because the microscope
        - So in the texts that you STUDENT read, they definitely mentioned the microscope at the very end there
        - Does STUDENT remember what was said in the text about the Lunar Orbiter
        - It was mentioned in the text, and I want to see it
        - Hi class, so I pulled you all into a small STUDENT, because I think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts, but I want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer
        - yeah so you're definitely right they need the microscope to be able to look closely at the water, but when they're doing this, they might not be doing this on the moon, so, if you look at the second paragraph, can you read the first sentence for me
        - Okay STUDENT so, you said that NASA sent a small machine right
        - Okay, so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right
        - Your answer was that they found craters of water on the moon right
        - And we'll start with a STUDENT this time, so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct
        - Okay um so what in the text makes you think that
        - is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no, but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes
        - Okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um, why do you think you are feeling more confident
        - that's a really good strategy um so in your response, you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah
        - awesome yes it is um, but I do want to ask you, while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable
        - Okay, so Oliver and Farrah you STUDENT did have similar answers you guys said not ready yet or not, for a long time um
        - So where are you confused STUDENT
        - that's a really good question to ask and that's something that I think STUDENT of you should definitely be asking some sort of version of when you're reading, so if the water is not ready yet, is it not valuable
        - Well, to me, when I think of the word valuable, I would say that I think that could be either now or in the future so looking at the question, the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So even though it's not ready yet STUDENT, do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future
        - So when we see it could be valuable that kind of implies the future
        - Go back and look at the text, so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says, you know future astronauts could drink this water, water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room
        - So do you have any idea of how you could connect astronauts drinking water to water being too heavy to put on a spaceship
        - Yes, and that's why we're going to talk about that because when you read a passage
        - But the real name of the machine was a microscope
        - Sometimes things be hard to understand because they use certain adjectives to describe the machine
        - So you did a great job finding that it was a small machine Jazmin, but STUDENT was just a little more clear and how she said it was a microscope
        - So we know you're reading everything and making sure you see everything in the paragraphs, right? So you you caught that first in paragraph two, but if you kept reading in paragraph three, you would have seen the real word for the small machine, right?
        - It's just the oxygen tank
        - Right you you did mention that in your response, which was great
        - Could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon?
        - I'm glad that you could acknowledge that
        - It would help you to get to the moon right?
        - Okay, so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon
        - However, can you elaborate? How did they use oxygen tanks to find water on the moon?
        - That -you did discover that they use oxygen tanks
        - Okay, what is that small machine
        - What did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon?
        - What specifically did it investigate? Use your evidence from the text
        - Right and ice is water correct just frozen
        - The small machine as you recognized is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon
        - What equipment did they use? You can look back in the text to help you
        - So you discover that there was water on the moon
        - So can you elaborate on why they use the microscope? What did they do using the microscope?
        - Um, so you're right, they do use microscopes to look really closely
        - And how does that relate back to the question?
        - Why did they need the microscope?
        - Did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text?
        - If you go back to the microscope that STUDENT was talking about, how did they find water using the microscope?
        - So they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon
        - Does it say it in the text?
        - That's how they found the water STUDENT
        - Using small machine that STUDENT identified
        - And then they took the microscope that STUDENT found in the text and used that to look at the water
        - Your response to the question, you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what led you to
        - Using a microscope as a piece of equipment
        - That was a great answer so Oliver you circle, the same as STUDENT what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used
        - STUDENT right, so if you go back to the first texts and moon is a desert
        - And microscope is one of the pieces of equipment, but remember equipment isn't always going to be defined as equipment
        - Equipment could be a machine a piece of technology, do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment
        - Paragraph two STUDENT right, can you tell me what it is
        - Okay, great that is a piece of equipment that they use, can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is
        - now if you go back to the question, the question asked how did they use this machinery to find water
        - Now, how did they use the Lunar orbiter to find water, you said that they looked for ice deposits right
        - Great and yeah ice is also what when it's melted
        - What led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon
        - now, they did find water on the moon, but what equipment, did they use to find that water
        - Can you find any in the text
        - there's the possibility there's what STUDENT said what he said, is there any others, that you have found
        - Where in the text did you find that NASA sent a small machine
        - all right perfect good job finding that out the small machine is a piece of equipment that the scientists used like there you were able to find that same answer as STUDENT
        - In reading that you also found that the small machine was called what?
        - Right and this paragraph, also tells you what a lunar orbiter does, can you tell me what the Lunar orbiter does
        - Perfect, now what about looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater has to do with finding water on the moon
        - yeah absolutely they had to use
        - Okay, so to review what you were saying they use the Lunar orbiter which looks for ice deposits in the craters on the moon and ice is just frozen water
        - So a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment that finds water on the moon
        - Now STUDENT your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used
        - so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water
        - right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water, but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right
        - Were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water
        - Yeah, so like yeah for I'll do an example so that you can like hear an example of it
        - You could just say a rug
        - You STUDENT have heard of vacuum, right? So say the small machine that you said in your sentence was the vacuum, you can expand upon it by saying this small machine caught a vacuum is used to clean up stuff off of a rug, or hard like hardwood floor but like you don't really have to say, both of them
        - Um, so there's a small machine that cleans the house
        - So we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um, I would like to just ask one other passages yes STUDENT
        - So yeah like it said in a text on that the water if they find enough on the moon, they couldn't make like a gas station, so now it's time that could be important,
        - i'm so STUDENT your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz
        - No it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um
        - i'm so STUDENT, you said, water is heavy so it's good and they don't have to carry it in the ship anymore um is there any other reason why it's good that they were not to carry it in the ship, other than its weight
        - STUDENT, why did you circle
        - The same thing that STUDENT didn't
        - What was your reason
        - a microscope is would not work because you need to discover the water, first, to use a microscope to look at the water, so you actually need the Lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon
        - and, why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - So we're using your background knowledge on the word
        - And like tool you like
        - So here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct
        - orbit to discover the water that is already on the load and you would use a like semana and STUDENT said you would use a microscope to look at the sample the water that you found on the moon, if that makes sense
        - the creatives are not full of water, it was a little bit of water in the craters on the moon, that the Lunar orbit does that
        - I don't think they are exactly what it out of the reading I think they they didn't feel that it was appropriate to writing with what the reading was about which wasn't discovering the water on the moon, yes
        - But that wasn't exactly what it was about
        - On what your answers could be changed, how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what I was expecting from you STUDENT who'd like to go first
        - Yes, orbiters what found the water on the moon, so how would you change your answer from what you originally had
        - You use a microscope to zoom in on something small that you cannot see with your eyes
        - Quality of it that it can zoom in on something and pick up very small details of the water and like what it's what micro like what's in it and stuff
        - So I'm going to go around the room and give a little bit of feedback to each of you
        - So I think you guys STUDENT did a really great job thinking while using our text
        - And Oliver your response was just comparing to STUDENT is which was a great point
        - She was absolutely correct
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Is there a place in the text where you found that STUDENT
        - And you talked about that NASA send something
        - Yeah, and I think if we look back into our reading, we can find specifics
        - So now i'm going to ask you, each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question, do you have a question STUDENT
        - The questions that i'm asking you, is in your answer, where, can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text,
        - so easy why don't you start for me where did you find your answer in the text
        - and also how was your answer answering the question
        - So in our reading we did learn a little bit more about what they used to find the water and the first question i'm sorry discovering the moon, so we found that
        - We found different answers and what you found and that that's okay we'll just have to look back in the text to find these answers
        - Thank you alright STUDENT so NASA sent a small machine where did you find that in the text
        - So the question asking what equipment did scientists use So is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes STUDENT
        - All right, awesome Thank you alright STUDENT, so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon, where did you find that in the chat
        - yeah So let me ask you now How does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - That okay so next time we'll really read the question through a little bit harder i'll read it more myself to help you understand the question better and then we'll we'll find the equipment okay
        - Okay awesome alright Oliver so your answer was just circling the same as STUDENT is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer
        - All right, thank you so STUDENT where did you find your answer in the text
        - Thanks guys alright so STUDENT we were talking about the microscope and how that's the only object that you found after looking through the first three paragraphs
        - But since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water, how can we brought in our answer
        - And that's okay um if we think back to Jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and, if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water
        - or anything that helps you find the water, so now thinking that way thinking anything that can be considered equipment to help us find the water is there anything more that you can think of that you saw
        - let's see where where did you find that in the text
        - yeah that's a great answer, thank you, so now we can see that we've used the microscope and the Lunar orbiter
        - yeah I totally agree, do you want to point out exactly where in the text, she found the answers for us
        - Can you find it for me because I don't think that we had a robot part in there, but that's Okay
        - and just a second the STUDENT can you find where the microscope is in text
        - so we know that STUDENT said that we found small machine in the second paragraph, so i'm gonna talk with Jazmin
        - So equipment is considered to be anything that helps you get to the water in this point or helps you get on to
        - The moon so basically you could even say that the food on the ship is equipment for the people to stay alive to get there
        - So it can be taken in multiple different directions, some people could be very like how you guys each said, one thing, but if we bring it STUDENT together, we have all the equipment, we need to find the water on the moon
        - awesome alright so STUDENT where did you find the information about microscope and the text
        - And Luis now that we've heard from STUDENT we've learned that we use the spacecraft and the microscope to see the water on the moon, is there any other
        - If you look in the second sentence
        - No the one that starts with "NASA sent"
        - Do you see where it says the exact equipment they sent, STUDENT?
        - Now, STUDENT, did you see where it said the equipment
        - So you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient
        - They um the water they found was microscopic that's why they need it on my microscope to look closer
        - And I would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what STUDENT said so, is there anything you wanted to add on?
        - Exactly, but before they could see them water with the microscope they had to use an equipment to find the water in the first place
        - Okay yeah no problem, so the reason why it wasn't the answer we were looking for is because we wanted to know the machine that help find the water
        - And the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it, so the microscope help them to see the water better, but I did it help them find the water
        - I know that you know STUDENT about space
        - It's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts
        - But this isn't about learning about space
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does STUDENT know what microscopic means?
        - Microscopic means that you can't see it with your eye that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to see it
        - So there's just a few things that we need to work on in order to create better responses and better understanding of the text
        - but right now we're just going to focus on what's in the text and answering the question from the text
        - So we're here because I have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them
        - You may know STUDENT about space, but this doesn't really have anything to do with learning about space it's going to be about improving our responses to questions when we read passages
        - So Farrah and Jazmin, the two of you, in your responses mentioned -actually STUDENT you as well, so Farrah Jazmin and Luis the three of you mentioned some type of equipment that was used
        - So going back again, the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so the key words, and this is for STUDENT five of you, the keywords are equipment and discover water for the passage
        - And then look for equipment that helped to discover water
        - So those are your key words
        - As i've been saying to STUDENT those keywords equipment and to discover water on the moon is really, really important when finding the answer in the passage
        - So STUDENT, you may have gone to NASA but we're going to be focusing more on what the passage is saying, because the question is specific to the passage
        - Has STUDENT had a chance to reread the question in the passage?
        - So in the passage you read that it talks about how NASA sent a lunar
        - lunar lunar orbiter to investigate and then, if you look at the sentence right after that, it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - So the reason that the five of you are with me today is because I have some concerns about your responses that I would like to address, so we can improve on them, so you STUDENT can better understand
        - How -have a better of understanding of how to answer questions that are given to you after reading a passage
        - Farrah you said no, not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so STUDENT yes
        - So, I have a specific little notes for each of you, so let me start off with STUDENT
        - um So the question is, is there evidence and you said no, not for a long time, so the reason that the question is saying is there evidence is when you read the passage
        - So the word evidence, what is it what is evidence, can you tell me what evidence is?
        - So and then is there, so is there facts that can show if water is valuable
        - what does the word valuable mean?
        - facts yeah yeah so it's facts, information, details that can help
        - So valuable can also be something that we need
        - Yeah, so when we think of value most of the time we think of money
        - Helpful is another word instead of using valuable
        - It's something that's helpful to us
        - So something that can be helpful
        - So is there evidence that let's rework the question just a little bit, so it can be easier to understand, because there are some big words in there, like evidence and valuable So is there facts information that can help the water that water on the moon can be helpful to us?
        - let's let's take a look at yours and then we'll go to Luis's um, you said that yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water, so you, yes, you did
        - so, as I was just saying to STUDENT she said that for in the future astronauts can
        - Really? I didn't know - is that, did you get that from the passage?
        - yeah so, which is why we this passage is pretty important since we need to know if the water and NASA can be valuable to us
        - STUDENT you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore
        - So did you get the part about water being heavy from the passage?
        - Okay, so your answer, you're almost there you're almost there, so you talked- you got stuff from the passage, but there is evidence from the passage that can be used on why it is, so why water can be valuable
        - Having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and other things, which is good because it's pretty much what you wrote in your response
        - Where it says water is heavy and it can take up a lot of room on the spacecraft
        - So I want one-- yes, STUDENT
        - So today, I heard you read Water on the Moon, is that correct? Anyone? Did STUDENT read? Yes, OK
        - So I want to revise our answers because I saw you had an understanding of it but I didn't see that you had a deep, deep understanding
        - So we're going to try to fix that today
        - But I want you to look, I want STUDENT to look on paragraph 2 where it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - Do you think that this refers to the question at STUDENT?
        - The lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Yes, so we're-- we're going to look at-- I want STUDENT to look at the machine it's referencing to
        - And I want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to
        - OK now I want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter
        - What does it do though? So what does the machine do?
        - Do you think ice deposits correlate with water by any chance?
        - I want someone else to answer this
        - So going back to what STUDENT said, the machine looks for ice deposits
        - So does STUDENT-- can anyone understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for
        - Does STUDENT agree with that?
        - But ice deposits are water
        - So that's the important part of the reading
        - Good point of the storywise, they were looking for ice deposits
        - Yeah, and what are ice deposits?
        - So what is the overall goal with this machine? I want you to say it in one complete sentence for me
        - And what are the ice deposits?
        - Yes , ice deposits are frozen water
        - And so they use that equipment to what?
        - So they're using it to investigate the water on the moon
        - Does STUDENT have any questions about that?
        - The water because the water is the ice deposit
        - Okay, so the two words that I think are the most important that I heard from was equipment and the second word would be discover
        - Does STUDENT know why discover would also be an important word in the question?
        - It's an action word, yes, because what, what are we doing? What is the question asking?
        - So they're trying to discover the water, does STUDENT agree? So now I want everyone to look at the reading
        - Does STUDENT know what ice deposits are?
        - So when we look at the second sentence, we can see ice deposits
        - Have a guess what is deposits are?
        - So is there any similarity between ice and water? Does STUDENT know the similarity between ice and water?
        - Ice is frozen water
        - That is a type of equipment
        - So ice so ice and water on the same thing
        - They're both water just in different forms
        - So going back to what STUDENT said earlier, NASA a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - Well the microscope is looking for something
        - So going back to Farrah's question before
        - When you said, why is the microscope the wrong answer
        - But the way it's written in paragraph two, they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water, then they use a microscope
        - I want you STUDENT to think for a second in your head about why they would use a lunar orbiter before they would use a microscope
        - I want you to think
        - hi STUDENT so today we're going to be revising our answers from the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So first before we share our answers with the STUDENT, I want you to independently for one minute look at the question
        - STUDENT had a good understanding of the reading, but I do want to work out answers just a little bit, because I think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects
        - Does STUDENT want to share what words they circled?
        - STUDENT, what did you circle?
        - Okay STUDENT else? any other words?
        - What did you circle?
        - You only circled water
        - What about you STUDENT you're one who hasn't shared yet
        - STUDENT of these answers are correct, but I want to look at the word equipment and the second one, I noticed no one circled was discover
        - Does STUDENT know why discover would be an important word in the question?
        - Excuse me, sorry I was confusing
        - Because it's an action word, because the scientists are discovering water, but how does -sorry discovering it
        - Does STUDENT know the difference between these two types of equipment? Anything, any guesses is fine, from what you see in the reading
        - The first word was microscope and the second was the small machine
        - So, from what i've heard from you STUDENT, you guys circled two words
        - I want you to look at the reading, I want you to think why they might be different, it might help you
        - Does STUDENT know why they might be different? Luis's on the right track, but does anyone know why they might be different? Look at the reading
        - What about anything else? STUDENT else noticed anything in the reading?
        - But STUDENT you're on the right track with finding ice deposits
        - Does STUDENT know the similarity between ice deposits and water?
        - And ice ice and water are the same thing, because they're both water
        - And from what we know in the reading that the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really -what are they really?
        - What else are they? what are the ice deposits, what did we just say?
        - So the lunar orbiter is finding what?
        - So do you think - does that make any sense? So what is the microscope, what does the microscope do?
        - So what are we using the microscope in this reading? what are they using the microscope for in this reading?
        - At the water, that's right STUDENT
        - So they already found the water when they use the microscope
        - So the microscope isn't the right answer because the water's already been found before they use the microscope
        - So if you have any questions about that
        - If you don't understand why the microscope would be the wrong answer
        - No, so no So what are they using the find the water?
        - So what is the answer to our question?
        - Can you explain what that means
        - Why did you circle the last sentence?
        - What was the machine called
        - look back to the reading
        - And do you know why based on the reading
        - They sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - What were they looking for
        - A lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters
        - So like the Lunar Orbiter
        - Why don't we look at the reading STUDENT
        - Let's look at the reading together
        - So what does it say in the second paragraph
        - So looking back in that
        - Thank you for reading that
        - What did you find what kind of equipment
        - It was very helpful
        - Okay, so what made you say that, why did you say that
        - So if you keep reading that sentence, why did NASA send that to the moon, what about it, what about the water did that did they need to send something to the moon for do you know why
        - yeah What was it called
        - what do we know about the water can you see it with your eyes
        - Perfect so NASA send an lunar orbiter to investigate and they needed that they were using that to help discover the water on the moon,
        - right it's too small, so they needed to use a tool called a microscope to view it
        - So can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail
        - You could say, can you explain what you mean
        - So do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon, they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope
        - Oh well, I really want to work with you because I want to hear how what your answer is, and I want to know what we can do to make it even better
        - but then I also want you to tell me the evidence that you have that makes you that made you come up with this quick answer
        - Listen, can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you
        - Okay, so I see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that could it be valuable Do you know what the word valuable means
        - Perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph, in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important Can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon
        - They could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there, what do we know, is the water light or heavy
        - Exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon STUDENT
        - yeah what are you confused about telling me
        - So be ready what made you choose that answer, can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that
        - that's true, but how does that relate to water
        - Can you read that
        - Exactly So what does that mean, how is that valuable
        - That is Farrah and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a STUDENT
        - Did you read that in the article
        - So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you STUDENT think that it's valuable that there could be water there
        - So I really liked your response
        - You said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And do you remember what we were looking really closely at?
        - So the microscope really did help it helps you see something really tiny
        - And if you remember in the reading, we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon, but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it
        - And STUDENT, I also really liked your response
        - But do you remember what the scientists used to find in the craters to find the craters
        - So can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - And do you remember what the lunar orbiter did?
        - And what did it and what wasn't looking for, STUDENT remember that one?
        - So STUDENT, just go back
        - So the lunar orbiter was used
        - It was a small machine sent by NASA to look for ice deposits and craters
        - Yeah, you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space
        - And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - You think it's the microscope
        - So what it's really having us do here Oliver is it's having us infer that they use the Lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon, so I can see why you are confused, but am I helping you clear this up at STUDENT, but the Lunar orbiter help discover the water on the moon
        - so at this point we're just trying to figure out what we what what what machine was used to investigate if there was water
        - it's the water so microscopic that it's still drier than the desert
        - So i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment started is used to discover the water itself
        - yeah so STUDENT and I remember your answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I can I I wanna I wanna I noticed that you
        - That you said you know that it's a small machine, they said, but can you tell me anything more about it, like what did you find interesting about it, maybe the name of the machine
        - Can I just ask you what made you say that
        - Okay, let me see maybe we could think back to the first reading
        - yeah a STUDENT is responsive originally was NASA send a small machine so she was able to gather that NASA did send a small machine
        - So I want to i'm I just want to wonder what made you say that
        - Did they use any equipment
        - Going to look back at your text is it on your tablets
        - Do you did you see any textual evidence in the first quote that says anything about equipment
        - Have you found anything
        - There wasn't anything mentioned about equipment you want to move on to the next quote
        - Can you point out any equipment used
        - Can you specify what they called it though
        - Now let's move on to the last quote
        - Can you tell me what it does
        - So in the text explains the lunar orbiter does something
        - And how it helps scientists, maybe
        - Can you tell me if they use any equipment in that quote
        - Can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe
        - Or did they mention anything more about equipment
        - I believe the microscope is attached to the lunar orbiter
        - Did you see the lunar orbiter or Microsoft that was referenced, you can answer that STUDENT as well
        - Yeah, it's probably a s machine just like a little Lunar Orbiter
        - And in the second quote it mentions the small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - It's equipment using it
        - So that was the equipment that the NASA had sent up to the space
        - Help to find the water and then the second equipment that was mentioned in the quotes, where the microscope, because that's an equip up piece of equipment
        - That can be used to help look at small little things, and the water particles up on moon were so small you wouldn't even be able to see it with your regular eyes
        - Maybe you STUDENT do have a good understanding of the text, but I think we can go dig a little deeper and relate the text to your answers and pull out evidence from the text
        - So I think so
        - Where specifically in paragraph three, do you see that
        - Why do you think that is the correct answer to the question
        - That's true, but the question is asking what equipment
        - So, what tools do they use to find those craters
        - But we're asking what equipment was used
        - So craters full of water means what they found
        - They use STUDENT that stuff, but specifically here in the text, where do we, where can we find that it talks about what tools they use to find those craters
        - So although they did use a microscope to look at
        - The to look at the water
        - You see in the text
        - However, I think it's important that sometimes even if you know the material
        - I think it's good to work on how we word things and just really working on our answering questions skills
        - So the question is asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Equipment usually means tools or systems
        - So let's think about the words in this
        - So find something or know that it exists on the moon
        - And then discover is another big word in there and discover means, how did they find water
        - Let's go back to the text and see if that's true
        - Can STUDENT find in the text where it says
        - where it talks about what tools they use to find the water
        - However, um, the, they did use the microscope to look at the water
        - However, the question is asking, how did they find the water
        - So they use it to look at the water, but what did they use to find the water?
        - Um STUDENT, I really like your
        - But back to the text
        - They might -Also in the text, they don't really, when they say water, we don't really see the word water in the text, a lot right? Did you STUDENT notice that?
        - Right? So they say that they looked for so that like STUDENT said
        - They use the they use the small machine
        - So ice is just dried up water
        - The Lunar the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and they found water in ice deposits
        - In the third paragraph, the water they found is microscopic so
        - And sometimes they the text is saying that
        - This in the beginning of the end of paragraph two, they say ice deposits are very small
        - And then when you think of microscopic microscopic means that they have to look through a microscope to to see it, which means that it's really small
        - If you put those two together, you can infer or guess from that, that ice deposits is where the water was stored
        - So, if that's where the water was, what did they use to find the ice deposits? Can STUDENT tell me? Can anyone refer to the text?
        - That can be true, however, today we're using science
        - to drive our reading skills so we're actually going to be using science ,a reading about science and about
        - As you STUDENT have done we're going to be using that reading
        - and we're going to be reviewing our, our responses to those questions
        - And we're actually going to be using the reading as a to work on our reading skills
        - So we're going to be learning but we're also- about science
        - But we're also going to be learning how to work on our reading and writing skills
        - And how we work to break down questions and such um
        - I think it was more that we can work on our answers to make them a little bit more to the expectation of using specific language
        - Like I said to STUDENT earlier, we're not just working on our science skills, we're also working on our reading and writing skills
        - that the text uses and as well as just working on our writing skills
        - So breaking down the question does STUDENT know what the word equipment means
        - So can STUDENT find in the text where it mentions um discovering
        - Or discovering something on the moon
        - Your response, which I think points us to a different part of the text that also mentions um discovering
        - yeah awesome and that's awesome knowledge and thank you for sharing that with us
        - Um just to redirect us bit back to the to the text, and to the topic um
        - So could you like just show
        - Could you share with us where you found where you read um or just I can read your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So I think can STUDENT recognize that there are two places in the text that talk about where we find something or water on the moon?
        - Um yeah, but we also are using today to not only does the reading help us know a little bit more about space like STUDENT knows a lot about
        - we're also going to be using that reading to learn and to practice our reading and writing skills and understanding how to break down
        - information that we might not even know about yet So how do we do that and stuff
        - So does STUDENT know what the word equipment means?
        - Can someone raised their hand and offer to explain it for us?
        - Equipment is just some tools or machines that we use to decide to do an action
        - So yes, that is what equipment is
        - So, for example, in the text we can say that some of the
        - equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text, but just in general astronauts use helmets
        - Okay um well just by going over the word equipment, I wanted to make sure that STUDENT knew what the word equipment was just because sometimes not everybody understands the question and then sometimes
        - So we just want to make sure that everybody is using the right language and everybody understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um STUDENT you had your hand up well, I was
        - Can somebody explain the question to me real quick?
        - So STUDENT understands the question
        - yeah So what we can say what tools or what
        - Instruments did they use
        - Now, if we look at the text where it talks about
        - These small the small machine can STUDENT find the name of the small machine?
        - And if we actually take take a, take a look back at the text, you can actually see that
        - So you can see that they are using a scientific microscope to look at it
        - But let's think about what else they used
        - And that's true, but we want to talk about what, what else they used
        - So, yes, they use the scientific microscope to look super closely at it
        - And then, now that we've STUDENT understood that we're going to need a scientific microscope
        - If we look in paragraph three
        - and now we also can keep looking at the reading
        - We can see that they said that the water that they found is microscopic so if you were looking straight at it, you wouldn't be able to see it
        - So definitely what STUDENT said yes
        - And then let's keep reading, paragraph three, in the last sentence that says, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really clearly
        - Well, they use an orbiter
        - I know you can tell me what small machine they send, and I know you can tell me what what they used to see it
        - Okay, so you, you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now, my question is did you see any other types of equipment, besides the oxygen tank
        - A small machine, a small machine What else do you remember
        - that's perfect, do you know any other tools
        - But that wasn't necessarily what the question was specifically asking the question was asking for what types of equipment and I know you circled the same thing as STUDENT, but I want to hear from you
        - to discover water on the moon scientist used blank can you remember what the scientists use on the moon
        - Can I ask you why, if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer
        - Well, I think that the question was asking was sort of asking that if you knew that NASA used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking, would you say that's good equipment is
        - can you add another tool to that
        - i'm seeing a pattern here, we STUDENT like the microscope in the orbiter
        - Now were there any others are those the only two that you could find I stopped after paragraph three, but if I keep
        - All right now i'm going to take a look at your answer and I want you to miss one you said I circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Yes, that is correct
        - But when you reach the third paragraph, you'll see that small machine they used
        - And that is in the second paragraph, NASA did send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter just looks for ice deposits in the in the craters
        - The small machine is called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So if we look back in the second paragraph, you're right
        - It says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found
        - That's looking to find the water
        - But as we see it in the third paragraph
        - You need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope, because you can only see it with the microscope, not the Lunar Orbiter
        - Did the scientists use to discover the water, not where is the water found
        - So if we take a closer look at the question and in the text we see that they use a microscope to find the water
        - So your answer was, NASA sent a small machine?
        - Can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer？
        - The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water?
        - Did you work with Savannh on this question?
        - Can you tell me why you picked that as your answer, I'm not saying it's wrong, but I want to hear where you're coming from with that
        - Did you work with STUDENT on the question
        - But what would be used to help scientists find water on the moon, and maybe use your texts to answer that question
        - Um, so, STUDENT, did you see, you said that you saw the microscope, and it was used to look really closely
        - Then, STUDENT right, well, so let's move on
        - So what did the microscope
        - Have you thought of an answer
        - STUDENT Do you have anything
        - So what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon
        - It says that this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - But I was wondering could you find an instrument that helped the scientists find this one on the moon and for your tax
        - And microscope and what is the microscope
        - Right, so how did they use a microscope to find the water
        - But what we did with STUDENT
        - If you remember, if I had STUDENT Farrah gave me the answer that said my cursor tropes will really
        - Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more
        - You said you had the same answer as STUDENT
        - Do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading
        - After giving yourself a little bit more time
        - Did you figure out any answers
        - um, and what the question was asked before, and it is right because I
        - Is being used to ISIS and different form of water
        - It's the solid for so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in the polar craters, which helps them find water
        - So i'm going to reread the question and once I finish, I want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer
        - So the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what do you STUDENT think the question is asking for
        - Right so in the question, it says what equipment did the scientists use so now when you're looking back at your paper with the sheet describing STUDENT of this
        - What you should be thinking about what equipment specifically you saw that was used to discover water, the key words in here, I think are equipment and to discover water on the moon
        - The microscope was used to look at the water, but if they had the water already that's means that the water was already discovered on the moon, so the microscope seems to be used after the water was discovered and to analyze it
        - But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found
        - And then afterwards, they definitely used microscope to look at the water and they probably had to have oxygen tanks when they are trying to discover it
        - But that wasn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon more as an add on, so I think you bring up a great point STUDENT, that there are probably lots of different types of equipment used when people are on the moon
        - But for this specific question, we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon
        - So um first let's go over it, so the question can anyone tell me what off the bat the question is asking? yes STUDENT
        - Okay so STUDENT, then, can you explain to me what the question is asking?
        - mm hmm So what is the question looking for and it's answer
        - Good right so when we read that question we're trying to figure out based on the reading if water is valuable or not
        - That is a great point so off the bat STUDENT, we should be thinking that we are looking for now evidence that proves water is valuable as a resource because off the bat the title says water is a valuable resource
        - so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at STUDENT?
        - It although it's being a little bit expensive don't you think that some of the points from the text would say that it is a good thing
        - um can you find a maybe a point in the texts that were explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable
        - um let's see can you point out to me where you found that?
        - The water is actually very heavy so
        - it's really hard to keep in a spaceship so if we were able to have the water come through moon it would lighten up the spacecraft leaving more room for different types of materials
        - So although, your answer was correct, that we do need to drink water, the evidence that would relate to the text would be more focused on how the water being on the moon would relieve space on the spaceship
        - Ok, so if you had to redo your answer STUDENT What would you say now?
        - mm hmm and then what would you add to it?
        - and so you're in your response you said water's heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry on the ships anymore, which is true because
        - If they do have that room on the ship, it would be very valuable because they could store more things, which is what it says in
        - The text so that's a great response
        - Yes, so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore, but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists?
        - Can you elaborate on that response
        - Next, STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, but how what equipment did they use or in the text
        - What equipment did it say they use to discover these things on the moon? Do you know?
        - so referring back to your texts
        - But what more specifically did they did they use to discover water on the moon,
        - Um, but I'm just wondering, more specifically what small machine did they use
        - How do you know they used to small machin, like did it tell you in the text? Where in the text is that?
        - You're using each other to help one another
        - Do you need me to to re explain it
        - What did you fully understand this question
        - I mean, you were all working in a small STUDENT which is great
        - But why did you circle, the same thing as STUDENT
        - Why did you think it is a right answer?
        - I see that you said that you
        - So it's actually both of them
        - So in our text in the second bullet point, it says that NASA sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate, they used both the Lunar Orbiter
        - And the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits, which is another form of water right I use is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon
        - Can you tell me why that's That was what your That was what you said
        - But if you think back to STUDENT response, she said I referred to the text and I thought about the specific tools they used so if you look back into the text, what do you notice about the specific tools, it says they used to discover water on the moon
        - so you said okay well STUDENT said that they use a microscope she looked back she thought about the
        - So it's not about right or wrong here right it's about building on our response strengthening it with textual evidence in and looking at the key ideas in the question
        - Maybe even what what are they investigating, if you think back to the question, what are they investigating what was that tool used for
        - it's very similar though right like they're investigating they're thinking about considering how they can find water on the moon so
        - i'm i'm noticing in your response, it says scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Right so actually in the text, it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon
        - but if you look at the question, can you tell me what a key word you're missing is
        - Right so just building on your response that you already have let's look back in the text it says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So that's the type of equipment isn't it
        - yeah yeah and it says that if it landed at the south Pole and looks for ice deposits and then, if we look at the next paragraph it talks about how the water was so so tiny that they needed a microscope
        - So if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response
        - and Oliver so Oliver, can you tell me why you circled the same thing as STUDENT?
        - awesome okay so STUDENT looking at your response and then looking back at the text you're saying you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so
        - If you refer back to the text, and you think about what STUDENT added to his response you're correct in saying that you do need a microscope to be able to see this water, but if you look at paragraph two, can you tell me what machine NASA sent to discover the water?
        - It says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it says that how they're really strong and yeah
        - can you tell me, building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger?
        - yeah it's a little bit tricky you have to think about other forms of water, like you have to think about ice or like gases, you know it give me a little bit tricky so
        - awesome so i'm noticing you started with a really strong response and then you added the the actual specific tool that they initially discovered water on the moon with right?
        - Right, but why, why is it important to include both of those names of the tools
        - yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon, does the Lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon?
        - Right so so maybe if an asteroid is going to lower the things the moon, that would be beneficial and necessary for them to have in order to discover water on the moon, but the machines they send don't need that equipment in order to successfully explore the water on the moon right
        - Right, so the astronauts maybe they're up in their spaceship their rocket ship up there, and then they send this tool out to investigate before they would go right
        - They needed an equipment to look very, very close to that little block of ice, and then they would see if there is water in there
        - So even if you're looking straight to it, you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not
        - STUDENT, you want to share something with us?
        - So they needed an equipment that would help them
        - I'll be right back with you
        - But for that, they have something very similar that they take it to the space so they can actually find that
        - And then it looks very, very close to the surface, and they look for ice deposit in li-- STUDENT?
        - So that's kind of like a little microscope
        - STUDENT Can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use?
        - So i'm going to give you two minutes to read the text and really closely read it with the question keep the questions in mind as you're reading
        - You are going to use one highlighter to highlight two examples of equipment that they used on the moon specific examples, at least two examples
        - And then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples
        - of why finding water on the moon, is important
        - Good i'm going to give you two colored highlighters they're going to be different colors with one color you are going to highlight two examples of specific equipment that they used on the moon
        - start with the other colored highlighter you're going to highlight specifically two examples of why finding water on the moon would be well
        - and find two examples of equipment news done the moon, and two examples of why finding water on the moon will be helpful, after the one minute i'm going to check in and see if you STUDENT need any more time
        - you're reading one through six but you'll find your first answer the equipment in one through three
        - That while it could be used as equipment to hold it's not necessarily something that the scientists used to discover the water
        - But I think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question
        - So what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon
        - that's STUDENT right so yeah i'll clarify that a little bit when I say let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or a valuable resources, something that we can use, so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water, the water that's on the moon
        - All right, you guys did an awesome job STUDENT after I clarified that for you do you have any new answers
        - I think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but
        - Do you, if you look back into our texts called water on the moon,
        - What is a piece of equipment that the scientists use in that text
        - Kind of look in the text and
        - Who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon
        - Yeah, so I so that the sentence that STUDENT is referring to is in the second paragraph, it says, NASA send a small machine Jazmin
        - Can you read us the rest of that sentence
        - They're not saying it would make it more it would make more sense if they said
        - NASA send a small tool because it's asking us or sent a small piece of equipment, since we're talking about the equipment they use, but a machine is also kind of like the equipment yeah STUDENT
        - So, STUDENT you answered with NASA send a small machine
        - So am I right to say that you, you said the equipment they used was a small machine
        - About what those small machine is called
        - Do you remember what the small machine was called
        - Who thinks that the scientists only use the equipment that they talked about in the passage or do you think the scientists use other equipment as well as the equipment in the passage
        - Do you think the passage list STUDENT the equipment they used or just a few of the common
        - Does STUDENT know what that means?
        - Does STUDENT have any ideas of how we can share evidence? Sometimes we can use a quote
        - It could just be anything that's written on the text
        - You can quote someone that said something, or you can quote what the author says, what the text says
        - It doesn't have to be a quote of what someone says in the text
        - And can we STUDENT think about why we chose to say those things? And see if you can find the part of the text that tells you to say that
        - You can go now
        - So can we go back right now, and we can STUDENT look at our responses, think about what we said
        - STUDENT, what did you add to your thoughts? How are you going to support your thoughts?
        - So did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read?
        - And did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks?
        - Because part of what we're doing is not just to learn about science, but it's also to practice reading strategies
        - So let's talk about the actual tools that were used, which I know some of you used in your explanation
        - STUDENT want to raise their hand and just list, maybe, one of the tools that were used, a specific tool that the scientists used
        - And that's right and we saw that in, I believe, the third part of the--
        - You need a scientific tool called a microscope
        - OK, and they used that in a specific line which STUDENT noticed, when they set the water they found is microscopic, meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you're looking straight at it
        - Now, when STUDENT found that, did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool?
        - And that is true, they did
        - And we saw that in the second part of the article, number 2, where it said, NASA sent a small machine called-- and you'd see that in the text, they called it a Lunar Orbiter, to investigate what they found on the moon
        - And that tells me that you understood it
        - And that you know that there was water on the moon and the scientists were using tools to examine it
        - OK, because your answer shows and tells me that you understood what the article was about
        - But maybe, we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that, OK, you know what this says, we need to focus on the tools, we're going to focus on the tools
        - Well, right now we're working on Olivereloping our responses
        - So even if you know a lot
        - It's about verbalizing what you know
        - So that's what we're practicing right now
        - SO I'M STUDENT in your response
        - You kind of talked about a tool, did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does
        - Yeah, so they use the microscope has any have, have any of you STUDENT ever use a microscope before,
        - So you have used to it
        - What have you used it on usually use it on like a small thing, right
        - And what we what we learned in the passage was that we that we were using it to learn to look at the water
        - And this tools that we talked about in the passage are tools that use to discover something there was another machine
        - STUDENT, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response
        - Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit
        - So when you say NASA send a small machine
        - Do you know exactly what that machine was called
        - But do you know what we're looking closely at?
        - You said, you'll need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely, which is which is very true
        - Do you remember why NASA sent a small machine and maybe what it's called
        - Okay, so if we look back to our reading
        - Does STUDENT remember why they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter a lunar orbiter
        - You know why they have to use a microscope, so do you
        - Why do they need a microscope to look really closely
        - So if you use a microscope
        - Look at really small things
        - Why do you think you would need a microscope to look at the water found on the moon
        - What is, what does that mean to you, why did you highlight that answer
        - So Deb, you said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - Can you explain a little bit more
        - Why you circle that
        - So you saw equipment in the discussion question
        - And you highlighted the microscope, just like STUDENT
        - So based off the conversation we're having now could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water and the craters
        - Good all right i'm going to call on STUDENT first let's talk about Jazmin answer so you told me that NASA send a small machine now where did you get that information
        - All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer STUDENT could you tell me what the answer was
        - that's awesome so what STUDENT told me is that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And then, what your answer showed me is the evidence behind that what a microscope does and why we needed to look really closely because it zooms in on the really small molecules in the water right
        - But what happened first is NASA sent the machine, so there might not have been any astronauts and the machine just went on to the moon, to look for the water
        - So we definitely use the microscope to look at the water, but the question asked which equipment, we use to find the water first
        - Exactly that's correct because the two equipments go hand in hand STUDENT what's going on
        - So at NASA they have like STUDENT said astronauts so they would use equipment like suits and
        - helmets to go into space and then scientists, a lot of scientists, they were special jackets when they're in the lab and sometimes maybe they'll wear masks to protect themselves
        - So where that fits into our reading if scientists, so we sent the machine into onto the moon, we collected some samples with them lunar orbiter
        - And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it STUDENT goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects
        - yeah so the machine did all the work that an astronaut might have done on the on the moon, but a tiny little machine did it for us, so we didn't have to send STUDENT up there, that makes sense
        - So, can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer, where did you get it from
        - So, knowing that now, now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer
        - I just want to say that you want to make sure you don't want to confuse the amount of water that they found in the moon, so there was a very small amount
        - So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope STUDENT right
        - So, which is absolutely true scientists may be using oxygen tanks, but did was that listed anywhere and Article didn't say that we use oxygen tanks
        - Can you show me where you found that
        - So the Lunar orbiter he looks for the ice deposits in the polar the polar craters and so your question is how exactly the Lunar orbiter looks for that right
        - You actually talked about microscopes, which help the scientists to see things closer, is that, sure, you said that right in your response
        - I noticed that in your response
        - I want you to think about what other things that we might find in look in lunar orbiters that could be helpful for us to have a closer look and Deb, I saw that in your answer
        - Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter
        - It tells us that the scientists actually send the lunar orbiters to to space that they don't actually go there themselves
        - They send these machines, like you said, STUDENT NASA send a small machine which is called the Lunar Orbiter to Earth
        - You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - And I saw that in your answer
        - NASA sent out the lunar orbiters to look at the little to look at the craters in the earth so
        - And as I was talking about with STUDENT that the scientists weren't actually sent out to NASA
        - But why do you
        - In that sense, the lunar orbiter do not need oxygen
        - Why do you think that using the text
        - Why do you think that NASA would send lunar orbiters instead of scientists or astronauts
        - So they send it up to space without the need or help of any astronauts
        - It was, it's like, it's so as STUDENT was saying it's a machine
        - And does STUDENT remember from the text, what the lunar orbiter does
        - So basically, it gets a closer look
        - That one of the helpful tools could have been a camera right there could be microscopes connected to the Lunar Orbiter, but there could also be a camera that would help scientists here on Earth, get a closer look to the moon
        - Do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at
        - Yes, exactly, and those are found inside the craters right the large pool of craters
        - Yes, small machine, the name of that small machine, if you look back into paragraph two, it actually tells us the name of this machine
        - things on the moon right, specifically the ice deposits
        - The the fourth paragraph, which was talking about how water is used and that's one thing that we talked about in our second question,
        - We know that water is made from hydrogen and oxygen so that oxygen can be taken out from the water and used for oxygen tanks like you said
        - is a small machine right that looks for ice deposits in a large craters,  that's what paragraph told us
        - Now Can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does, can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you guys raise your hand and when you guys could share with the STUDENT
        - All right, let's get back to what STUDENT was saying about how the water is heavy so this paragraph is that water is valuable because, on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft
        - now they have room for what STUDENT?
        - Yes, so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts, like you said, hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing STUDENT
        - Yes, so not only is water valuable because we can drink it and it can save space and spacecraft but also because we can use it for what you said oxygen, STUDENT that's very true that is good observation
        - STUDENT could you tell us what that something else is? It's in paragraph five
        - We also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else
        - But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water
        - The evidence that we put out here is wrong, it is valuable, but then, how do we get that water is also another question, we can ask ourselves to see if that evidence of water being valuable is actually convincing
        - Chris just something else to add to the STUDENT
        - How is what STUDENT said, change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged, she said, the oil better product strategy part to get
        - We still see that as valuable, so I think that, just because we can't it's hard to get does not make it not valuable the water is still valuable not what we're trying to prove in our argument right
        - Okay, so I just heard STUDENT of your awesome responses
        - So I'm going to start
        - And I just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text
        - What is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like, what can you expand on your answer
        - Um, can I ask, how about STUDENT, do you have anything else you would want to say about the reading or your answer that you answered before john expand a little bit
        - Did you notice I'm a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water
        - When you talked about the microscope
        - I loved your answer
        - Have you ever seen a microscope
        - Does STUDENT know, raise your hand
        - Yeah, awesome, isn't it, what do you use my microscopes for
        - Okay, do you think it would be really cool to have a little waters on it and see that there's water in the moon from the story that we read
        - For a couple of you guys so deb could you go more in depth with your answer, I know you did circle, the same as STUDENT, but I want to know why you did, or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah
        - awesome So what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly
        - STUDENT that right that's me okay sorry I couldn't really see your name tag um so I was wondering, so I remember you were talking about how NASA send a small machine Do you remember what the machines name was
        - Okay i'm STUDENT Do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking
        - STUDENT do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house
        - You were talking about how, in paragraph three, it talks about the
        - I just was wondering, so you said no, not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well, I don't
        - So I do agree with you, but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker, do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon, instead of bringing it on their ship or now well, I mean if they could do it faster and quicker than
        - Okay, what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah
        - yeah, but do you agree that if it was ready, that it would be awesome to have it on the moon
        - hmm and do you remember, if there was anything from the article that i'm told us if the water was used is there anything else, that it can be used for
        - No, it is much better, like the water was on the moon, because then the ship doesn't have to carry STUDENT that water, and it will make the ship more heavy yes even
        - yeah so I remember when I was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel to
        - Which is very helpful, do you STUDENT remember reading that part
        - Does STUDENT want to like talk about how that could be very useful and valuable maybe yeah yeah I can
        - know that could help us a lot right
        - So Farrah would you want to maybe like how about Farrah and STUDENT could you make a sentence or a new answer to the question that we're trying to answer
        - With the information that we just talked about STUDENT together
        - yeah that could be really cool imagine if there was a gas station like on the moon
        - So I was just going over your responses
        - What are they looking closely at?
        - STUDENT, you say that they need a microscope to look really closely
        - The water they found in the craters, right?
        - So based off of that, where do we think the water is being found?
        - It says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - So let's read number one again
        - So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So let's actually go to you now, STUDENT
        - What other equipment have they used on the moon with the water?
        - Can you read that sentence and tell me what the machine is and what it does?
        - OK, so let's look at the actual sentences, OK? So we've already talked about the microscope, but if you look at number two, it says NASA sent a small machine
        - STUDENT, I see that you were talking about a small machine
        - Is that the machine you were talking about?
        - I want to know a lot more of what you know about it
        - So tell me about the machine
        - I would just like to hear a little bit more detail
        - It's not wrong at STUDENT
        - Awesome, and why do you think it looks for ice deposits? What would the ice deposits tell us?
        - Yeah, but what would it tell us that involves water?
        - Yeah, so can we have ice without water?
        - Right, so that proves that there was water on the moon because there's little bits of ice everywhere, right?
        - OK, and let's go to STUDENT
        - Can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that?
        - I like that, that is very true
        - STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - That's really cool, I love that
        - Did you learn about the Lunar Orbiter at STUDENT when you were at NASA?
        - So why don't you tell me a little bit more about what they did with the water that they found on Mars-- the moon, not Mars
        - Well, let's look at this sentence right here
        - It says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it
        - So what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see?
        - Right, so let's go back to your response real fast
        - You said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - So if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see, are the craters really full of water?
        - So what i'm hearing from you is you're saying that you used your background knowledge to answer it first right and I love that I love
        - The difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you, can you tell me the
        - Right, so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer
        - place, I really like that, and I agree, so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right
        - Good and how did you come to that conclusion
        - Right um, can you tell me a little bit why you think that
        - Right um so kind of wha,t kind of the same thing I was sent to STUDENT, can you tell me
        - Why it's not ready
        - STUDENT But I want to talk about how we answered the questions, not so much the facts about the moon
        - Well, it's really good to have background knowledge on space
        - But can we try to think back to that text we read in the equipment that excited
        - I can read you the sentence if you'd like
        - It's an NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate this this lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater, the ice deposits are very small
        - To STUDENT earlier and gave her some suggestions
        - So what makes you think
        - Okay, and the end of the article says that
        - Okay, so let's look at your answers STUDENT so you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water right
        - That, how is that valuable, so we can do that right, we can split water water molecules into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us, how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon
        - So let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to
        - Oh, I think it's in paragraph number five
        - Take a look at the second paragraph of the article
        - What machine did NASA said that they use to discover the water?
        - So then after they use the Lunar Orbiter
        - What did they use to look at the water?
        - Look at the third paragraph
        - STUDENT, you said that they use a small machine
        - So great job, recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon
        - Do you remember what the name of the machine was called?
        - Okay, that's totally fine
        - Let's look at the passage and see, just like with STUDENT Let's look at the second paragraph
        - And then, do you remember what the other
        - The other thing they use the other equipment that they used to see the water?
        - So they had to look very closely at at it because it was so tiny
        - Alright, let's look at the third paragraph
        - Do you remember what equipment do you use to find it?
        - So can you show me where in the text she found those answers?
        - Can you read me the sentence of one of them
        - What did you, why did you circle those things?
        - You wrote the same thing
        - So can you - before they found the water, what did they use to find it?
        - So they found the water and used the microscope to use - to see the water because it was so tiny
        - But what did they do to find it? Do you remember?
        - Can you read me that sentence? Where you can find that?
        - Do you remember the second machine?
        - So you said the scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - And do you remember where we found that?
        - So Luis I'm really glad, you bring up a good point, so the point of this group, I just wanted, I want you STUDENT to know is that
        - You guys made some really great points, some of the points that you well made STUDENT together or your in your work separately um some of them could use a little bit of improvement here and there
        - The questions were asking for some direct information from the reading and different things like that, and I think some of you might have missed some of it
        - Because you're in this STUDENT doesn't mean that you did something wrong or that you did something bad we're just here to improve the work that you've already done
        - In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine
        - What do you know, so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it
        - I think what the question was asking was for you to talk about what kind of tools, help them discover more water on earth, excuse me, not on earth
        - On the moon, they use a microscope but what but what really helped them discover like what was the tool that really helped them find the water okay
        - So you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - What does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at
        - So if scientists are using a tool called a microscope
        - And so we know the word microscopic means what
        - Yeah, so the small water
        - You can think about things
        - What else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon
        - Maybe you've used a microscope
        - STUDENT have you used a microscope before?
        - Because plant cells are also really small, like the water on the moon that STUDENT mentioned
        - Wow, that's a great connection STUDENT, because we are talking about scientists, but there's also many other occupations and jobs that people do were like doctors who use microscopes
        - Is there a Quote, that you remember
        - I was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text
        - So you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes
        - You said NASA send a small machine
        - Do you read about that
        - Do you have text evidence from your response
        - And then after that it also talks about small ice deposits, which then
        - Now where in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle, the same thing
        - Can you point that out, just so that everyone's on the same page
        - So can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have? Also oxygen tanks and spacesuits, things like that
        - So you and STUDENT kind of have similar responses
        - Well, there is always textual evidence, but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life
        - You have to actually get to the moon before you actually discover the water on the moon
        - What, what was the machine called, what they do
        - Can you be a little more specific
        - And what did the machine do, what is used for?
        - Now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource?
        - i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be Chris Jazmin STUDENT
        - What makes you think you got STUDENT figured out
        - So is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show, or is it that you, you like you have a really good understanding of the text
        - But, based on the text, what makes you believe that water could be a valuable resource
        - What made you say that
        - Okay, and STUDENT you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text
        - Where did you find your evidence
        - um so the text where you find your evidence isn't necessarily important, so long as you can back it up
        - You said yes astronauts can drink the water to stay hydrated
        - But for this, we're wondering what they're using for the water, you know? So we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use, we're thinking what are they using for the water
        - So they do use oxygen tanks
        - They do, but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on?
        - So does STUDENT want to-- actually, OK
        - So STUDENT, for example, you said that they used a microscope to look really closely, right?
        - So that's an example of what they used in specifically to find the water and to see what's going on because the goal of this question is how we're identifying the water on the moon
        - Because remember, they didn't know if we had any, and then they found it
        - STUDENT, where did you find this? How did you know? Did you find it in the text?
        - but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking
        - But do you know-- like STUDENT said the microscope, do you know why they use a microscope from the text?
        - Do you know why they have to look at it so close?
        - So it's because there's so little water that they need to look at it so close
        - So we're going to be focusing on just this text, so that we can digest this and answer the question
        - So even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information, but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read
        - So where do you think you found that one
        - And do you know when we answer these I want you STUDENT to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text
        - Yeah they do use that that is a really good point
        - So like the microscope part, where was that?
        - You can say The number of the point it was on
        - Is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text
        - It's talks about the water they found is microscopic
        - So in the third one
        - So they did find them in the craters and but what part of the text did you get that one from?
        - Did you find that anywhere, specifically in the text
        - So they use both
        - So they use the Lunar Orbiter to look for the ice deposits in the craters, and that's where they could find The water
        - So they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both
        - So i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over, and so what I want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes STUDENT
        - So good so in the text where did you find that in the text, what made you choose as your response
        - Nice so are you also having the same ideas STUDENT where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym
        - So, in your answer, why did you choose that
        - Alright, so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question
        - STUDENT right, and what's, the key word that they're asking for
        - So we could reward that you find in the text, what equipment they used
        - Anything keep the craters We just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay
        - STUDENT right, that is very true I want you to walk me through where you found that answer
        - In paragraph five, did you find it
        - yeah so in the question, the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water
        - yep so you do need oxygen to help them breathe to find the water, but what equipment was used directly to find the water is what we want to know
        - it's the microscope and the Lunar orbiter so I want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking
        - Finding the water it's how they found it so they needed the microscope to find the water, because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the Lunar orbiter to find the water because that's where they used to find the
        - Really, so do you think they could use the Lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah
        - so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence
        - Can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence?
        - So I know that a lot of you STUDENT did mention being able to use a microscope
        - So now, what's something where something that stands out in that sentence
        - Were there any other things in the text that you noticed that were different than Farrah's idea? Well, I think the microscope is the right answer because it's such a scientific tool, and the question asks about equipment, so I didn't see any other scientific tool in the story
        - STUDENT right, well, if you look at the story, you see in the second paragraph, it says NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - That would be considered another piece of equipment that NASA used
        - So that you know where you saw that in the text?
        - But we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text
        - So first we're going to practice together how to model, a question or not how to model, a question we're going to practice how to break down a question so i'm going to give you STUDENT an example first you guys can see kind of what you want to be looking for
        - So, for example the question i'll use is what color is my sweatshirt? So when I look at that question, there are a couple of very important words that question
        - The other words and the question don't really have much meaning
        - What makes it a question but it's it doesn't connect to anything you can't see what, but you can see color and you can see the sweatshirt
        - The important words in the question, are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read, so you want to look in the question and see
        - on savannas answer was the one that I was more posing the question for, but I understand how
        - Alright Chris Jazmin Luis and why do you like to share the word that you STUDENT chose for um that was super important and the question or even why you share
        - so was there a word that you guys picked in your STUDENT that you got that you thought was important to a question
        - I think that's a really great response you STUDENT I think equipment is one of the most important words in the question
        - And I also think that equipment is mentioned in the passage So when I want you STUDENT all to do individually, I want you guys to look at the passage the moon, is a desert
        - So what words are what equipment has mentioned
        - That is also used to find water on the moon
        - Would STUDENT like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled
        - a microscope have some study the water and helps them look at it, but the microscope itself did not get it STUDENT the way up to the moon okay
        - Oliver you agree Jazmin you agree STUDENT you agree, I also agree as well, that you do need a microscope to us to look really closely
        - So let's STUDENT, why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon
        - Why did you circle the same as STUDENT?
        - so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what is one important word and that question STUDENT
        - And let's look at moon water found could be useful in other ways, water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, which is where I think
        - You think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank
        - So um STUDENT, can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two?
        - The lunar orbiter So how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers?
        - STUDENT, how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer
        - Right, so what we know that the ice deposits are very, very tiny, so I lunar orbiter is just another word for a microscope but it's more it's a more specific word for a microscope right
        - Where do we use a lunar orbiter?
        - On the moon, and where can we use a microscope?
        - How would we make our answers a little bit more specific?
        - Okay hi everyone so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does STUDENT remember
        - Right, so we kind of changed our answers a little bit to include the word lunar orbiter into our answer
        - So let's talk a little bit more about what we can - go ahead, STUDENT
        - Okay, so let's go back back into the text and find some evidence to include in our answer
        - but also because the water is so small on the moon right?
        - So how can we add those into our answer?
        - STUDENT, how can you change your answer?
        - All right, let's go to STUDENT Jazmin, how can you change your answer?
        - yeah all right STUDENT, how can you include those into your answer?
        - So STUDENT remember, we said that we use a lunar orbiter on the moon, but a microscope could be used for anything
        - So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific?
        - So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon
        - awesome So how can we change your answer a little bit STUDENT to include that evidence and then also include the little the Lunar orbiter?
        - And your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - How did you get to that answer?
        - So you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - We're going to start with you
        - Okay, that makes a lot of sense that you put those two together
        - And that you would need a microscope to look really closely to see that
        - But what paragraph three says is that the water that they found is microscopic
        - So if you can look at, paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate to discover the water on the moon
        - That's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space, but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more
        - So Oliver, I see that you just answered the same as STUDENT
        - Did you read the article
        - They didn't use it to discover the water
        - The lunar orbiter was used to investigate to look for ice deposits and the big craters that are on the moon, but the ice deposits are very small
        - So they use a bigger they use the machine to find the ice and then the microscope would be used to actually see it to see the water
        - Well, your answer is not completely wrong
        - You did say that NASA send a small machine, but can you tell me what that small machine is
        - Okay so STUDENT your answer of scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - I had a they did find craters full of water
        - But the question was asking what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So they use a small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate and they're investigating these these craters on the moon
        - So they so let's talk as a STUDENT
        - So the amount of water that they find is going to be very small
        - And they're looking for ice deposits, but the ice deposits are very small
        - So then, in paragraph three, what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water
        - So the first piece of equipment that they're using what's called what
        - And the second piece of equipment was called what
        - The microscope would be used to see the water because the amount is so small
        - In the article, if you could go back and look, when they used the microscope, they get and use the microscope to find the water
        - NASA did use a small machine
        - Can you tell me what that small machine was?
        - So the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, what would be a good full answer, STUDENT?
        - Now when they discovered the water on the moon, did they discover large amounts of water or just little teeny, tiny amounts of water?
        - And that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it
        - But STUDENT told us that the article says that in order to see the water, we would need what, Farrah?
        - If you look at paragraph 3, it says the water they found is microscopic
        - So STUDENT, they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water
        - And in order to see the water, they would need to use a microscope
        - So how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article?
        - And what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable?
        - So why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts? What could those things-- what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for? What do we use oxygen for?
        - So breathing would be a good use for the oxygen
        - I have to read too because I don't know what we use it for
        - Astronauts could breathe the oxygen
        - So we could do it together
        - And oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel
        - Do you STUDENT see that?
        - So paragraph 5 says that water can be broken down into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen
        - And what did they say was the problem with water and carrying water on the spacecraft?
        - Does the article tell us that water is light, or is water heavy?
        - And it would take up a lot of space, right?
        - So taking a lot of water in the spacecraft to the moon, it would be a lot of weight
        - What does it tell us that the problems could be? What's the issue with the research? It's at the very end of the article
        - The article tells us that there might be some problems with doing research for finding out why the water-- a convincing argument for why this would be useful
        - And it would take a lot of money
        - But spending the money, building the equipment, and doing the research, do you think that it would be worth it? Is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for NASA to spend the money and do the research?
        - They would have to do a lot of studying on the moon's surface
        - So if NASA didn't have the money or the manpower or the equipment, those things could be a problem
        - So in paragraph 6 it tells us that scientists would need to come up with a plan for getting the water out of those big craters, and that making the plan, it would take a lot of time
        - And they would have to build new equipment
        - So, STUDENT, you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research?
        - Right, they would need water to drink
        - But if they do the research, and they spend the money, and then they don't get a lot of water, then what? Do you think they would be upset?
        - You are probably right, NASA does have a lot of money
        - So they would feel like maybe they were wasting it
        - So they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon, that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon, that those uses and the amount of water, that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment
        - Why don't you look back now
        - So can we look back into the reading and you see anything about a microscope in any of the sections, you can tell me which section if you see it in like how they're numbered, let me know
        - And if you don't see it, that's okay too
        - Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So who can tell me what is discover mean?
        - We're talking about discovering the water
        - Exactly, it's divine something
        - So did they use the microscope to find the water in the first place
        - Or maybe they use something else
        - So, STUDENT, you made the point That maybe they needed it to see it in the first place to discover it
        - And do you know what that small machine is called
        - So what would you add STUDENT to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment
        - That they use to find that water
        - Does STUDENT remember where they found the water?
        - So you STUDENT said microscope
        - OK, so the if you read on, in the second paragraph, it talks about how the craters were in  Deposits of ice
        - Right, so the water wasn't just clear and streaming and flowing
        - And ice is really hard to get through
        - So the ice is something they needed to get through to get to the water get through the crater to get to the water in the ice
        - Do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water?
        - So do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors
        - So what do you remember what it's called with right back into paragraph two,
        - The key words in the question where to discover the water
        - What did they use in that one, that one tool
        - that were discovered was the key word we were looking at
        - So they they said right in the question convincing evidence that means we're going to use right
        - And I see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five, is that correct
        - The hydrogen in the oxygen
        - It can be water can be broken down into two parts
        - Can you read the next sentence and tell us why is that important that it can be
        - Why does that matter though to keep reading and see if you can find anything else
        - Broken down into two parts, because now we have this hydrogen and oxygen
        - There you go, and is breathing important
        - You see, right, especially when you're in space when there is an oxygen
        - You could get the water right there, split it up and have oxygen to breathe
        - I do have a question for you
        - Is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article
        - Do you remember, or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on Earth
        - What else do we use water for that talks about in paragraph four,
        - Drinking water is important, right, do we need that to survive
        - They'll know it's there
        - So if the water is already there
        - The astronauts don't even need to worry about bringing as much or Storing as much on their spacecraft
        - So then they maybe they can stay longer and do other things such as grow gardens, there are just explore and see what else they can find so that's awesome
        - So the astronauts can what with it
        - So we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much
        - That you had originally thought maybe the water isn't going to be that useful
        - Because it does say that it's going to take a lot of time and money to see if they could do these things
        - But our question was kind of asking more broadly in general is there possibility
        - Our question is asking if the water on the moon could be valuable
        - Do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot
        - So thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and STUDENT the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it
        - So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts?
        - Listen to the word, and is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So you weren't convinced, but the question
        - Right, so that there's some evidence behind that and we breathe in oxygen, there's evidence of that
        - So those are things we STUDENT have our own opinions, but those are things that you can prove to be true
        - So we are going to talk about The tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Alright, so we have three different many paragraphs at the top
        - Can I please have someone be volunteer
        - To tell me what they think the main idea is for the main point of the first paragraph is
        - The textual evidence that says the scientists found water on the moon
        - And when you found that and underlined it
        - Whoever finds it first can raise their hand and read back to me the exact words in that first point, the talks about scientists mining water on the moon, and we'll see if we agree with STUDENT
        - Right, what's, what's the textual evidence to support Chris's claim with the main idea of the first Paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon
        - STUDENT can review it in front of them
        - And then when you're ready, raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph
        - Does it say what the name of the small machine is
        - Can you elaborate on that
        - Do you think that NASA used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon
        - Yeah, I think I agree with you, if there were astronauts, they would, they would have to be astronaut suits and oxygen tanks
        - But we're STUDENT here together to try to dive deeper into this text to find more specific answers to our question,
        - Farrah and STUDENT, I see that you have identified a tool used by the scientists to see things that are very small
        - Indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking
        - From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water
        - Does any of that equipment that you listed
        - Do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon
        - So one of the things that I'm going to, I'm going to mention about this kind of question about whether or not you think that there If there is convincing evidence that water on the moon might be valuable
        - This is a a question that asked for your opinion
        - So, people might have different opinions, but STUDENT opinions, need to be based all these opinions and to be based on evidence in the text
        - Some of us for STUDENT going to rely on the actual text that we have in front of us to inform our answers and inform our opinions
        - That's okay if you disagree with each other
        - So we might disagree with each other
        - And can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore
        - Could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is
        - Do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable
        - I want to, I want to see what you've imagined in your head
        - Could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more
        - And how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts
        - Is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts
        - If you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel
        - Does I'm pretty cool
        - I just, I just need the actual text, please
        - Did, can you tell me where it is in story, I believe you
        - And are you are you thinking that because it's going to take a lot of money
        - That the amount of money that we put into invest in this, we won't get returns
        - Yes, okay microscopes are really helpful for letting us see things up close
        - And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you
        - Either you can explain why did you circle that
        - So could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it
        - Let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water, especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water
        - Yes, good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so How does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use
        - Can you reread paragraph two, for me, and see if you can find any other answers
        - But I just need you to write down where you found your answer
        - But then I want you to tell me where you find the evidence
        - And the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts
        - I know that you know about space
        - So STUDENT, we're working on reading informational texts
        - That would be really cool
        - Because a small machine could be anything
        - It could be a computer later right
        - And look for those answers in the text
        - Yeah, this is going to be a lot of fun
        - So I first want to go over the question, the question that was asked was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Can somebody tell me what this question is looking for
        - Can I challenge your thinking, what is what is equipment mean do you do, you know,
        - Are we going to look to our friend
        - So again, where are we going to look for the answer
        - Are we going to look around the classroom
        - Where do you think we can find our answer STUDENT?
        - Who was doing the discovery in the question
        - So the question was what equipment did scientists use
        - And the answer, you'll find is in the text
        - Do you think you could try to Read the question and maybe look at the text
        - Yes, in this story that we read
        - Totally because if if you ever get a question which might happen again and other classes or places you a question
        - The text is probably very important
        - And there's a text there
        - Okay STUDENT Do question
        - Hey, so today we're going to do something super cool
        - Okay, so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text
        - We are going to be reading detectives
        - I have learned that about you and it's something I value about you, but I want us to work on the skill of answering questions by finding the answers and attacks
        - You know what you think
        - This year, you're going to need that skills
        - Because when we read informational texts
        - What made you answer that
        - But while I do that I was hoping that maybe you could reread your answer
        - Why, why did you answer it like that and see if your answer is in the text
        - When you read the question what relied talk me through it
        - Well, first, STUDENT, before I became um what made you think that was the correct answer
        - So I was wondering, what can you talk me through your answer
        - Does the machine have a name?
        - Okay, small that works
        - Because if I was somebody that didn't read the text I could think of small machine was anything right?
        - That would make your answer spectacular
        - Yes, but I'm going to challenge you for a minute
        - Can I challenge you, as a detective
        - Okay, there's actually another piece of equipment in there
        - Could you maybe look at that piece of equipment too just so I know that you can find an answer in a text
        - Totally know it's, it is important, but I would like you to look for the other one too, okay?
        - Can you talk me through your answer really quick
        - Can STUDENT explain how they did that
        - Does STUDENT know what that machine is called
        - So Oliver and Farrah think that it was the microscope in Jazmin and STUDENT Both think it was the lunar orbiter
        - So Chris is saying that you STUDENT are both right that they use the microscope and the Lunar Orbiter
        - I want you STUDENT to take a minute to skim through the text and to think about what you think the main idea of this text was
        - Right now, I want you STUDENT to take one second, just give her the text and fake
        - Is it possible that there's more tools that scientists use to discover water
        - What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water STUDENT
        - It sounds like you're talking about the machine that they used to travel to the moon
        - Do you know what this machine is called
        - Can STUDENT tell us what this orbiter Did?  someone we haven't heard from yet
        - How did you STUDENT arrive that you're thinking
        - I'm wondering if that was what helped you come at your answer
        - STUDENT I'm hearing that your dad's an astronaut
        - So STUDENT, I'm hearing that You think that water is heavy and that they don't have to carry it on the ships
        - Seemed to be very strong you you said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and that you need
        - So I'm hearing that you use the similar strategy to STUDENT
        - I'm wondering how is your answer, different from STUDENT and what evidence did you use To explain how your you got a different answer from Jazmin and what evidence you used
        - What do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable
        - Um, can you tell me more about this
        - Can STUDENT tell me how it feels, answering these opinion questions
        - We asked that to answer and test a dependent question
        - Can you explain to us, or is the function of the microscope
        - So, you know, wish and use a microscope to look closely on the water right but we can find the water first, and then, then we can look at the water closer later
        - I mean, what did the scientist call the small machine?
        - Can you explain more about the small machine, what tell us more about what the machine is
        - Oh, you have a problem here
        - I mean what equipment or Oliverice they are using to discover the water
        - Now, we need to figure out how they find it
        - Maybe it was through the thing about the questions, the scientists used the microscope or to discover water or observing the water left out
        - Do you think of which one to
        - But the question is asked her as to find what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water not observing the water
        - And I think someone else have listen guessing with you
        - So can you tell us what to the oxygen tanks used for
        - Um, but the question is asking you to find the equipment to discover the water
        - Not for the oxygen, right?
        - Okay, so first one off of the key words that are used to cope
        - So what do you think, how will you revise your answer to include the equipment
        - And because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer
        - Discover, yes, great this the word in the question and this is the action that we are looking for in the passage
        - She said the machine that discovered was a small machine, right
        - And so, Chris do you notice what STUDENT just said
        - If you still have some progress
        - And what I'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy, then you are going to practice it in a small STUDENT and I will come back to talk a little more individually
        - Okay, so what was one of the keywords that are you circled, STUDENT?
        - and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there
        - Perfect that is exactly right and equipment can be some kind of  scientific tools
        - And STUDENT else do want to show you your keywords
        - And I appreciate that you used the evidence from the text, but do think microscope is the best answer?
        - Yeah, great sometimes we look at the question
        - So did STUDENT circle the words in a question that was important to establish equipment
        - The word, but the question is talking about that is also an important a word
        - And if we look at an action
        - Excellent word in the question and it's the action, we are going to look for it
        - When you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer
        - And you said the crater of water, that is a fact, what made you say that?
        - Yes, so did you'll find a place in the passage, you can do that
        - How you will make your answer more specific?
        - Did you find evidence of that in the text
        - So a scientific tool called a microscope
        - Yeah, so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things
        - So microscopic means it's really small,
        - And Oliver, I saw that you said you circle, the same as STUDENT
        - Would you like to reread the article?
        - STUDENT You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Where did you see oxygen tanks
        - I saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Yes, it's very, very cool
        - But is that equipment
        - Right, so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it
        - Did you hear the name of the equipment that they used this can go to STUDENT
        - So that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        - Number three, so that we can kind of make an understanding of this
        - Is the water on the moon, big or small
        - Right, so it's small, so it's saying
        - And what does a microscope do
        - So do you think we could look at the water that's really small
        - So, let us look at things that are really small
        - Right, so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, but that doesn't necessarily say that NASA sent a microscope to look really closely, it does it
        - Do you see a sentence that starts with NASA sent
        - Right, so where in the article
        - But what was the key word that help the scientists find the water on the moon?
        - Okay, so you talked about water and how there was craters on the moon
        - Why did you circle equipment
        - Okay, so you circled equipment and you knew that a microscope was in a tool that was used for equipment
        - Why did you say equipment
        - Right, so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space
        - Discover okay why discover?
        - What was that small machine name
        - So you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do
        - Do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool, or do you think the microscope is after doing more research?
        - And so, STUDENT after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one
        - So you found the Lunar Orbiter and the microscope
        - But so Chris and STUDENT, so that they found the two tools of equipment right so
        - Did it help find the water on the moon
        - Okay, so let's look at both pieces of equipment
        - Right, so the microscope helps us see things that is really small, but Not necessarily found the water on the earth right?
        - So you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water they found on moon right
        - STUDENT Can you summarize what the paragraph said
        - So, you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, but it was ice right
        - Okay, so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon, and then STUDENT, you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right
        - The Lunar Orbiter, or do you think the microscope did?
        - Do you think found the water
        - Right so STUDENT, which tool
        - Do you have a name for the small machine
        - Right, so the name of that small machine, you just said is a lunar orbiter
        - So, STUDENT shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something
        - To go around, right
        - The small pieces of ice
        - So did the Lunar Orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water?
        - So what you just said was that the lunar orbiter went around the moon and spotted the water
        - Than you you were able to use the context of your microscope, which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces
        - We're also going to be learning about answering a question fully And making sure that we're giving all the information that's in your head so that STUDENT knows that you have a full understanding of the topic
        - What did NASA do
        - How about that, who can answer that first question
        - So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence
        - But how did they find that ice is the question
        - It says they sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So that was step one
        - So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there
        - I'm sorry, the water is microscopic so it's tiny
        - And they even explain to us, it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it
        - So what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small
        - So the moon is so the water that they found
        - So I guess if we rewrite the question, what we would say
        - Is that the equipment that scientists used even though they weren't on the small machine, it was still a piece of equipment right that they used
        - So the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - And microscopes to investigate the small tight, the smallest or I'm sorry, the water that was found this tiny
        - I can tell you included some really awesome information, but we're here to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to us and using the text that was given to us
        - I know I remember that
        - And based on your answer
        - I was thinking more along the lines of which word tells us the exact question being asked so that word that I was looking at is what goes on with equipment
        - That's a good point, that's definitely an important piece of the question
        - So we're going to be looking for what they used right not how they use something or why they use something just what so but you are right that we are looking for the equipment use
        - So STUDENT mentioned that we needed the microscope to look at the water very closely because it's so tiny
        - So that's a very, very important piece of information that needs to be included in the answer
        - What do we think is the first piece of information that should what should go first, the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        - That's what came first, in the text right?
        - Right, I mean you know how I also a good way to test to see if that makes sense
        - I can find that right in paragraph two, whereas, I'm sorry, not STUDENT Jazmin's answer I can find in paragraph two, but Farrah
        - Where did you find your answer
        - So let's see, paragraph number two, where we found out about the lunar orbiter that Jazmin's discussing
        - So I the text actually doesn't really give us that much information as far as how the lunar orbiter would have been able to find the tiny water
        - However, it does say that
        - We want to make sure that we're answering the question that was given to the fullest and making sure we're using evidence from the text that was given
        - However, we're working on a few different things in this STUDENT
        - So we're looking for the equipment used
        - And where did you find that
        - So do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together
        - I love that answer
        - So it sounds like you both found pieces of equipment that were used
        - Um, I know that does sound funny
        - So, what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope
        - Um, so the text doesn't imply that the astronauts went to the moon
        - So, so I'm looking at, paragraph two, right now it says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So it doesn't necessarily say that any astronauts went there, however, that small machine was still necessary because that's what found The ice deposits
        - This lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and the large polar crater
        - So that's what actually found the small little water so that I can and I found that information from the second sentence
        - Right, so then with the microscope in paragraph three, it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope When they were examining it back here on Earth
        - In an equipment, like you said, STUDENT is a tool that they used in order to discover the water on the moon, right
        - So we're in the process to reread it
        - Yes, I want you to skim the text and let me know which Equipment
        - In particular, they used to discover to make this discovery
        - Can you help me find out where that is, which which pairs
        - Paragraph two NASA sent to be small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of That supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc
        - Wow, that's awesome Background information
        - The particular equipment that they, the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - But do you know why that is
        - Yeah, STUDENT Jazmin's answer was right
        - It wasn't used to discover the actual water
        - Yep, so you, you didn't find out and learn that the microscope was used for a different purpose of studying the water right
        - Let me ask STUDENT
        - Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer
        - It's not specific to the text right
        - So I noticed that STUDENT told me She was able to point out that the small machine could mean anything
        - So is that referring to any equipment, that the scientists found or used?
        - Let me pull up my text, which paragraph was that in
        - What equipment and scientists used to do what, what is the purpose of this equipment Oliver or STUDENT, can you go
        - Okay, so you have the equipment part, you know, that part is important, what action which which equipment
        - Yeah, discover and so you're going to go back to your answer for microscope it it's not asking which equipment they used first, what are they asking?
        - Discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part
        - And did you get that information from the reading that we did
        - Do you think we would be able to see STUDENT of the water on the moon
        - If we had a microscope in our classroom
        - Or do you need more than that
        - but on what I'm going to do now is I'm going to read out loud
        - The three facts that are out on our paper called the water on the moon
        - And I want STUDENT to be listening
        - So I want STUDENT to put on their listening ears to listen to the five figure out
        - Water on the moon, because in these three facts that I'm going to read out there will be some answers in there
        - Then they use the microscope to see it
        - They did so once they actually found the water
        - Does that make more sense
        - So they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water
        - Do you know we just read about it
        - You want me to read it again
        - Oh yeah, I think that it goes around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Right, they did and they did that through what equipment
        - And what made you say that
        - So first, tell me what made you say that NASA sent a small machine
        - What made you choose this answer
        - So what made you
        - So, why, why do you think the microscope is the correct answer
        - So you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this
        - Did you get to find what equipment they use to discover water on the moon
        - So which one if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon
        - Can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does
        - It goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does
        - So do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is
        - So now what I want you to do is look through the text where it says where it talks about discovering water on the moon
        - But what is our question asking us
        - Right, what specific equipment
        - Did they use to discover water on the moon
        - Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water
        - Right, so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe, breathe, but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon
        - So I see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment
        - STUDENT, you said that people that scientists use like microscope to look really closely
        - And that's one part of it
        - Do you remember any other parts from the reading
        - Do you remember what it was called
        - But what was, what was this water like, was it like like a cup of water
        - Or like, What state was this water found in?
        - Yeah so wasn't just water
        - So here on earth you might find like giant lakes, full of water, but on the moon
        - So the reason that we're thinking about the microscope is because the water on the moon was microscopic
        - So when you think of microscopic
        - So if we're thinking about the water found on the moon
        - Are we thinking about, like,
        - Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water
        - How big do you think the craters were?
        - STUDENT when you've said that you found craters full of water
        - So even though we're on the moon these ice deposits were in a big crater, but the ice deposits are little
        - So you said NASA sent like a small machine
        - So what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for
        - So they used it to investigate
        - what makes you think that it's small
        - When you find when you think of this like small machine and you're finding the ice
        - Does STUDENT know what a partial answer means?
        - Okay, so I put all of us into this group because STUDENT here has a partial answer
        - Because what's cool about partial answers
        - Well, Luis This STUDENT is actually going to work together to try and learn even more from each other
        - And if we put some of these answers together and we think about each other's way of thinking we can get more complete answers
        - Is that STUDENT has different partial answers
        - And in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer
        - Is there anything that you think you might want to add to that
        - The, the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find
        - Let's look a little bit closer at the reading
        - So I'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph, not the paragraph
        - Okay, so the part that I'm going direct us to is
        - Where it says, NASA sent a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - What do you think it talks about what's the main thing
        - What are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add?
        - I can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them
        - And when you're reading through what makes you, where do you think that came from in the reading?
        - Where do you think STUDENT got the answer of the oxygen tanks
        - So, although this answer is right astronauts and to use that what we want to see us in the text
        - This one is asking for us to see in the text, what tools were used
        - But when we're looking at our question
        - What exactly did NASA use?
        - Oh, where did you find that in the text
        - You found your first answer in paragraph three, correct?
        - You found that in paragaph two as well right?
        - Let's look a little closer at Chris's answer
        - So what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where Chris got his answer and what you might STUDENT yeah
        - Since we've looked at Jazmin's answer and Luis's answer
        - We just picture like giant things
        - So when we picture craters
        - Did they give a name for what the machine was called
        - And do we know what craters are
        - Yeah, I'm looking in the text now and I see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines
        - That was a great description
        - Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Well, so we're looking for what equipment
        - So if we look back in our text
        - But we're looking to see what equipment they use to discover the water on the moon
        - Maybe someone can read from the text
        - If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon
        - They said something about investigating what did they used to investigate
        - Yeah, and member STUDENT had said that they sent a small machine to investigate
        - So do you think maybe they sent this machine to investigate and then once they found the water, they were able to use a microscope to see the tiny pieces of water that like it
        - The text says if you look straight at it, we wouldn't be able to see it
        - Do we see anywhere in the text that it says that there was an astronaut present
        - It says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So I'm STUDENT is right
        - That is kind of funny
        - I think that um STUDENT, you were absolutely right that if an astronaut got sent
        - I don't see that either
        - But now that I'm reading the text just like STUDENT said I din't pick up on this before either
        - To look at the moon, they would definitely need the appropriate protection to be able to do so
        - It doesn't look like There was an astronaut
        - But I really liked that we were thinking maybe the next step, maybe in the next step would be to bring an astronaut
        - So we probably didn't need the equipment and and oxygen tanks and masks and things like that
        - So let's just say for this question
        - It says, What equipment do we know what equipment means
        - And STUDENT I see that you wrote scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Do you think that oxygen tanks were used to discover the water
        - So they're asking what tool
        - Scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, it's kind of like a tool
        - So STUDENT You answered equipment like oxygen tanks
        - You also said that NASA sent a small machine
        - Now, let's see, STUDENT
        - That article had a lot of detail about what that's STUDENT machine was and maybe how it helped to discover the water on the moon
        - I really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Yeah, and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water, but do you think it helped us to discover that water
        - Before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something into the moon or on to the moon to help them discover that water
        - and so do you think that if we look back in our texts, there's something that says  A piece of equipment that helped us to find that water before we used a microscope
        - So the first thing that the scientists did was investigate, they needed to investigate the Moon before they could even go in and see anything else
        - So I think maybe our first step would be to think about what scientists did to prepare themselves what scientists knew or didn't know before they got to the Moon before they got some use a microscope to look at their water
        - So it does say the word astronaut and it says that water could be valuable for astronauts if there were astronauts present because they could drink that water
        - Do you have any suggestions on your answer how we could improve upon your answer
        - Do you see anywhere that it says that the oxygen tanks helped to discover the water
        - Do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned
        - Did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon
        - So you said that they had sent a small machine
        - Yeah, so that's a great answer
        - But I'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that
        - Do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer
        - Looking at that question now and looking at what you just read
        - We read in the text
        - Can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, let's take a look at your answer
        - What do you mean, what are they looking closely at
        - So you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and STUDENT
        - Yes, but let me ask you a further question
        - Could they just send a microscope to space and find water
        - Or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water
        - They use some sort of other equipment
        - Well, so if we refer back to the text I do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water, but before they get a microscope
        - So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon
        - And our question is about the equipment that scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - Do we see that they said they sent astronauts in the text
        - And so, STUDENT, did they send astronauts
        - So what did they send
        - So if the question that asked us what what equipment did scientists use to better look at water we would absolutely say the microscope
        - And so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon
        - But first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon
        - What else was that article about water
        - Great STUDENT, can you build to your answer
        - Can you add any other details
        - What else was the article about STUDENT
        - But I want you to think about what made your mind think that
        - What made your mind, find that answer
        - What did you read
        - Okay, so let's STUDENT read read through it
        - I think we have two minutes left and see if we can build on our answers
        - I also want you to think of the thought processes that you had in getting there
        - So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers
        - I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it
        - I'm happy that you work with STUDENT
        - So thank you for sharing
        - Did you get any answer independently
        - And everyone's going to have an assigned partner to work with in with your partner
        - I want you to share your answer and explain why you had that answer for two minutes and then I want our partners to switch in the person who did not share will then share
        - And explain to your partner
        - Why you found that answer
        - If you notice the word so you can explain
        - And where did you get that idea from within the text
        - Yes exactly where you found it
        - Was that a big clue for you
        - Why is that your answer?
        - Well what paragraph, did you get that from?
        - Do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon
        - So did your original answer change in any way after working with STUDENT
        - I want you to think of how, what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon
        - Once scientists are on the moon
        - They use more equipment even more to make more discoveries
        - So I want you to think of what a scientist does throughout STUDENT of the processes
        - And think of what different kinds of tools
        - And what did you did you work with your partner just now
        - What equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon, not which equipment was more important
        - So I work from STUDENT the different students that each student found a different tool to use
        - But there's a certain Tool and I want us to go back in the text and find where it says, um, that we use a certain that scientists use a certain tool or a piece of equipment, um, to investigate the water on the moon
        - you do need a microscope to find the part, the particles of water that they found  Because it was so microscopic that you needed a microscope to see it
        - But the question that I'm asking is what What piece of equipment was needed in order to find that water they used to different, um, they used a different source of equipment
        - Yeah, I'm NASA did send a small machine
        - Do you remember what that small machine was called
        - Can you read that out loud for us, where
        - Can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence
        - You might be able to bring us to the right answer
        - But when we go back and read the text
        - It was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water
        - That was what was used, so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like STUDENT said they used a microscope
        - Let me go back
        - So if we go back and the text
        - Number three, paragraph three, the last sentence says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So that is one scientific tool that would be used if you wanted to look really closely at the water
        - So it's a different source of equipment
        - But the question was, um, what what equipment was used, so that they could find the water to begin with
        - but we're going to go over this question together because I think that STUDENT of us
        - Had a little bit of misunderstanding with this question
        - And I want to lead us to the right answer today
        - So I'm just here to clarify the answer for us
        - Can someone identify the name of that small machine
        - Who can tell me the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate
        - Either we STUDENT didn't write it for our answer
        - And that's why I'm working with you today to get you to the correct answer
        - But you didn't write that for your answer
        - Now some of you wrote that, um, the microscope was used to discover the water
        - Now they didn't use a microscope to discover the water they use it after they discovered the water to look more closely at it
        - But the question is asking what equipment was used to discover the water and that's where it gets tricky
        - Because we might think it could be the microscope, because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered
        - Okay, I got us into this STUDENT because I wanted to clarify a question that we answered, because I want to reread some parts of the text so that we can find the correct answers
        - Has STUDENT is thinking changed
        - Yes, the answer is yes
        - I'm the question, however, access to think about, um, is there convincing evidence
        - Can someone tell me what evidence means
        - It's like the driest desert on earth we only have very small microscopic amounts of water that was found on the moon
        - Because the moon is is really dry
        - Why does that make it valuable
        - Okay, why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true, that it can be broken down into two parts
        - But if we read on, and we get the complete idea if we finish the, the thought in the text and we keep reading
        - We may learn why that's important
        - Yeah, it's still valuable, though, you're right, value can mean money to that value has a double meaning, but in this sense, the valuable in the question means
        - Is it a good resource and why
        - Is it a good resource that water on the moon
        - And if we go back in the text weekend find detailed descriptions and examples of why the water is valuable
        - So I've seend all responses, and I would like for you STUDENT to use evidence from the text to support your answer
        - Does STUDENT know what I mean by using evidence from the text
        - STUDENT Would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers
        - I like the way you're thinking, can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used
        - So you said a small machine, but what some machine would you be talking about
        - It is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water
        - I'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that information but in a connection to the text and the question
        - They do use a lot of equipment
        - We have to think about the equipment that is used to discover water on the moon
        - But to identify the water they use a microscope
        - What's going on with this water
        - And what about water on the moon
        - The fact that water on the moon is being discovered
        - So now that we know these two things we know what we're looking for a while reading the text
        - So thank you for that
        - We know that we're looking specifically for equipment and the equipment is used to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you for answering the question
        - And STUDENT, would you mind talking about how did you get that answer, what in the text caused you to answer that
        - And why do you think that's an important part of the question
        - Why do you think valuable, tell me more, please
        - So we need to find information from the text that is convincing to support Our answer of water on the moon being valuable,
        - Yes, that is another meaningful valuable important or something worth worth
        - But going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Yes, a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text
        - What are some things that are listed in the text
        - Did you see that in the text
        - So why is that valuable
        - Why is that important
        - And what could the hydrogen
        - Oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out
        - hmm that's so what, why is that such an important thing
        - Great while Luis is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side, so Farrah and Oliver I noticed that, once again, you STUDENT must have worked together, because you have some similar answers
        - so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right
        - Is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece
        - so you wrote about water being heavy
        - what did you mean by that
        - hi everyone I am your Teacher and it's so great to see you STUDENT today i'm excited to work with you on trying to Oliverelop really complete answers
        - And STUDENT did your background knowledge help you, with your answer to the question I see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that did you think about that from your background knowledge
        - So now STUDENT going back to your response you did a great job talking about equipment that scientists use, but do you think that the oxygen tanks themselves were what was used to disk to discover the water on the moon
        - Alright, and Oliver I see you circled the same as well, so we can address both of you, together here, so can STUDENT, can you tell me what does a microscope do
        - But STUDENT Do you remember what our key action word in our question was
        - discover great and STUDENT Do you know what another word for discover might be
        - Yes, exactly so discover means to find
        - In a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope
        - Yes, that's an excellent point I think here in the text, what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay
        - because the text does tell us that they found the water in the craters
        - Yes, so I see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon, but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit
        - yeah definitely and I think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def I see you have something to say
        - STUDENT and I just sorry or Sir, could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me
        - How can you come up with this answer?
        - Did you finding the passage
        - yeah which line it's
        - The sentence and your previous answer
        - So, can you tell me like where you found this answer, STUDENT?
        - what's The purpose of this equipment
        - Okay, so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question
        - yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you
        - Just the machines name right
        - Oh, a lot, where do you find this information
        - Oh, where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph
        - So that's a good point there
        - Because they find this water, it has too tiny that we can, we have to use this micro me with this microscope
        - You have to use a microscope
        - In order to see the water, you have to see
        - but can you remember how that small machine was called?
        - That's the thing that they send and then in the beginning to discover water
        - Yeah, like whatever you think that was equipment to discover water
        - The first thing that they send, and when they discovered this, I let me see the number
        - So that was it
        - Then after that, they use the microscope carries and being
        - When these discovered this tiny water
        - Yeah, just see this tiny water
        - But the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks
        - Do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water?
        - In the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts
        - A robot doesn't need oxygen to survive
        - They send that they just sent the Lunar Orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot
        - Yeah, it was able to explore or the craters around it, then the moon
        - And find these little amount of water in there
        - First of STUDENT, let's think about these texts
        - So can you tell me where are the main idea of this text
        - And let's think about the main ideas of these texts
        - But so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text
        - Okay, so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about
        - What is the other main idea that we can learn
        - So what do you think about that
        - Yeah, I'm talking about
        - So can you tell me what is it, what is in the microscope for
        - Okay, so you say that a microscope is the equipment that they used to discover water on the moon
        - We have two main questions too many words in this question is discover and equipment
        - And also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right
        - Yeah, so maybe the microscope we didn't they didn't use a microscope to discover water, but maybe they use the microscope to observe to analyze the water after they discovered that water
        - So we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning
        - Well what in the text makes you think that within the next, what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment, for this idea?
        - So what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water
        - Yeah, from this story like for this case for this specific case, we're talking about discovering water in the moono
        - So what in the text makes you think that that's a, that's a main word
        - What do you think that
        - Okay, so what is another what is another main word of this question
        - So what is another word this question, STUDENT
        - But there is another another word that I want to talk about it
        - What is the verb of this question
        - So now we have discover water and equipment
        - Okay, so let's think about it
        - So now let's think what equipment this science is used to discover water on the moon
        - Can someone told me where is your answer according to the text
        - I know that you get it
        - I know you know that they sent a small robot to find water on the moon
        - Can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot?
        - Yeah, no, STUDENT, got it
        - And it was a robot in the name is lunar orbiter right
        - Also, it's also good
        - So there was a small machine
        - Okay so they found  this equipment to discover water on the moon
        - So when they discover water on the moon
        - What is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters?
        - After that, they have to
        - They have to make an observation
        - And how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can, they, they will need to observe this water
        - Um, what do you use the microscope for?
        - So can you tell me what is the main
        - So you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water
        - I just pulled you STUDENT together so that we could have a discussion about that question I wanted to go through each of your responses and talk a little bit about what evidence you are using to back up what you said
        - I wanted to prompt you to think about what happened before they looked through the microscope in order to look through the microscope, you need to have a sample
        - You can turn and talk and you can look at the first two points and think about how they may have gotten the sample to look at through the microscope
        - When you think of a desert
        - Do you think of what do you think, what do you see
        - Yeah I noticed that you didn't
        - You didn't mention any water
        - Do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert
        - Do you think there's water on the moon, a lot of water
        - And we read past that first sentence
        - If we look at I'm at point two
        - Can you maybe think of what that machine did in order to get the water
        - So what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits
        - What do you think that might mean
        - Yeah, it doesn't say that
        - But if we read between the lines that I'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope
        - Yeah, they use a lot of different equipment in order to go on these missions to find out more about the solar system
        - So, did you find any anything in this text to backup that there was oxygen tanks
        - I was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer
        - Okay, did you have any different thoughts
        - The discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on
        - So was the tool that they use to discover the microscope, or was it maybe the Lunar Orbiter
        - So if we are trying to answer the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So we're focusing on how they found the sample
        - Yeah, in order to see it, you would need to but first they have, they have to find the sample to look at
        - Can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample?
        - So how did they find those ice deposits
        - So, does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer
        - Yeah, so that's why I wanted to pull you into this STUDENT so that we can have a little bit of a conversation about how to answer the question, fully
        - What part of the question, did you pull out as being the most important part
        - Jazmin and STUDENT What did you pull out as being the most important part of the question
        - Discover, why did you pick the term discover
        - Can you now take a look at the passage and see what that small machine that you brought up when you first
        - Then, what, what was that doing was that maybe discovering something be able to
        - So while we're working together
        - I want you to to you STUDENT to keep those two points clear in your mind that you need evidence and that you need to be convinced
        - I want to, to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time
        - What made you say that it's not ready yet?
        - What exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon
        - Um, I wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon
        - Yeah you and STUDENT both brought up points about the fact that water was heavy and that water can be broken down into two parts
        - I wanted to clarify with you to what other functions of water are there
        - Um, what other functions, water has
        - And to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon
        - Does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it
        - when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it
        - So remember when we first started we talked about the question and how it asked you to be convinced based on evidence that it's worthwhile
        - Do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile
        - But we're looking for
        - Does STUDENT remember what that's called
        - This is this specific name of that machine
        - Can you STUDENT just remind me
        - And can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does
        - What did they use it for just
        - So like you said
        - They said the small machine
        - So that's actually a great connection you made because since the water so microscopic maybe us humans can't see it
        - Well, that's a great point
        - So the lunar orbiter is in helping investigate
        - So we need to use that piece of technology to find the water
        - Where's the, where's the water exactly on the moon
        - What part of the moon
        - So yes, that they're in these big craters
        - The large polar craters, but the so the ice deposits are in the creators
        - So we need to use that scientific tool called, like you said, a microscope to look at the water really closely
        - It's very, very, very small
        - So, they, they, the scientists, they go into the moon and they use the Lunar Orbiter to find the the water which is in the craters
        - And then there's a microscopic amount of water, super, super, super, super small
        - Like, what STUDENT their first answer using the microscope
        - When you think about the climate of the moon
        - They need to use a microscope to be able to see the water, the small amounts of water
        - So again, if you if you're thinking about now going forward
        - Said that the moon is drier than the dry desert on Earth
        - So when you think of like the feeling of the moon
        - It feels like a desert
        - That's something that can help you remember this information
        - So even if you think as a moon because it's in space as like dark and it might look different than the desert
        - so then we can go forward and make sure that we're STUDENT on the same page about what, what did they use
        - What made you say that as your answer what stuff
        - I actually have a follow up question for you
        - What really stood out to you
        - Why did you say that
        - Um, what made you
        - So you really focus on the word microscope, that's something that you really focused on
        - What made you focus on that specific part in relation to the question that it was asking
        - So I'm also going to follow the same question for you
        - I'm gonna ask one more person for what their answer was, so I can gather STUDENT this information, we can use it to work together to find an even better answer
        - So I'm glad you said that
        - So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and STUDENT, what exactly what language or what part of that
        - Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me
        - What equipment do they use for this specific job so they do have different kinds of equipment that they use for different things
        - Do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question
        - Do you have a question
        - STUDENT, have you chosen a vocab word yet
        - So we have equipment we have water we have discovered, we put STUDENT those things together
        - I think we have the perfect three words so we can combine the words you guys STUDENT said equipment to discover water
        - I want you to have a revised answer
        - And when you come out of that
        - So maybe your answer is already right but maybe I want a little more, maybe your answer is not really right
        - And you can just change it completely
        - So go back into the text
        - So maybe, maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt
        - Alright, I see people looking up
        - So I think we're gonna I'm gonna ask for some provide answers
        - Anyone else have any information that they can share with me, STUDENT
        - What made you say that?
        - Yes, it's that so it said that if we're reading the text it says the water they found is very microscopic microscopic means small right?
        - It says it will you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely
        - So we're actually looking for the piece of equipment that they use to find the water
        - So we need to look at that word discover, and you wouldn't be able to get to the water, unless you had this Lunar Orbiter
        - I think someone mentioned that great piece of information
        - That was in that was in lunar craters
        - And the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water
        - They might have had to use a microscope, because there's such small amounts of water
        - So even when they got there with the Lunar Orbiter
        - Think through this, this question like how did scientists right so far away on Earth, find water
        - I was like, Well, I thought about this STUDENT night
        - I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for
        - Yeah, yeah, some great stuff
        - How do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need
        - So we're, we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading
        - So sometimes when I'm reading, there's so much information
        - Because sometimes when there's so much information in the text
        - We want to make sure we know what we're looking for with information
        - Did you circle then
        - So what it, what word
        - What did you circle STUDENT
        - Discover that might be a very important word too
        - okay so STUDENT is a circle of equipment and discover
        - So the first thing is, um,
        - Okay, well, you know, I think these words are going to really help us when we're looking
        - We're looking for this information in the test
        - Farrah, and STUDENT were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment
        - Was there any other equipment that was used in the text
        - Okay, tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about
        - Okay, so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon
        - and see the exact name like if STUDENT can help me find the exact name of the machine that they use to detect the water, how you talk over it for about two minutes
        - See um well I do see that the size of the water they found was actually microscopic but
        - they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water, since it was so small
        - You know what else did they use
        - and now, what about you STUDENT did you, you know learn anything new from this paragraph, I know you love space, but you know
        - yeah cool and how are you deaf did you, you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use
        - yeah well that's you know I think that's kind of like the bigger question here, I think the orbiter was part of the first step, they had the thought I wonder if there's water on the moon, they sent the orbiter to kind of you know
        - Just do the initial discovery or initial I guess investigation and then the microscope was really what cinch the deal, and what
        - You know they looked really closely once the orbiter got the larger body of evidence that there could be water, so I think they you know they both work together
        - and STUDENT, looking at the text, can you explain what the Lunar orbiter did?
        - So there seems like there's two steps to this right? there's first the investigation period with the Lunar orbiter and
        - cool so that's kind of, what do we think STUDENT? that's kind of the first step
        - STUDENT can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process
        - STUDENT, can you kind of explain - it seems like there's two parts, Do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the Lunar orbiter and the microscope
        - Can you explain to the STUDENT, you know how those two work together?
        - The potential uses of water? Was that exciting? or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon?
        - Did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful
        - But the question was specifically asking what equipment they used to discover the water
        - So they actually yes look let's look back at the text together the ice deposits are very small so so I guess you did say that the they found craters full of water, and there the text says that there was actually very small ice deposits
        - and actually the total quantity of water on the top layer of the moon's surface is only about the equivalent to the amount of water, you or I would drink in a day, so you know actually I like the spirit, you know you tried to answer the question, but unfortunately
        - and it says that there's it's drier than the driest desert on earth so yeah
        - A moon crater you know those are deep craters but they only found a small quantity of water
        - And so STUDENT why don't we actually start with you, I noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, is that right
        - You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon
        - STUDENT i'm wondering about your answer to you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, is that right
        - Do you think that your answer answers that question
        - And I know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery
        - yeah can you remind me what that was called
        - awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water
        - And while they're talking Oliver and Farrah I noticed you STUDENT circle, the same thing is that right
        - yeah okay so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Okay um in the text, what did they What were they using the microscope for?
        - Definitely, so they said that the water was microscopic so they needed to find- they needed to use a microscope to be able to see it
        - Um, did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water?
        - Oh STUDENT okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so Jazmin, you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, so NASA send a small machine
        - What was that machine called?
        - yeah and what was the purpose of that machine, so we had a small machine, it was called the Lunar orbiter What did it do what was the purpose of it?
        - STUDENT um, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right?
        - Can someone tell me what that word was again? there was one word that described the water -how how much water there was
        - Okay, so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water
        - um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right?
        - um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks?
        - so you and STUDENT were saying that they found or that they used equipment like oxygen tanks
        - what we're doing today, why have you guys in a STUDENT is because we're trying to go even further we're going to
        - Try to elaborate on and expand our answers a little bit, I want to know what you STUDENT
        - are thinking on both with your original answer and your new answer um so i'm going to be asking each of you
        - What your initial answer was if you have a new answer what that answer is um and we're going to talk about it a little bit so while i'm asking one of your classmates
        - I want STUDENT of you to listen to what they have to say and think about their answers and see if it can help you get a little bit of new insight into the text
        - Okay um so STUDENT can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer
        - um so STUDENT i'll ask you first um when you came up with your new answer um what made you come to that knew the answer
        - How great so you STUDENT have the same answer in the end that they use the Lunar orbiter
        - The ice deposits in the moon were very small right, so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say? Can someone actually answer this for me in the text, when we were reading it um What did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon?
        - Yes, a lot of dirt and not a lot of water right um so Harrsion definitely and there's not a lot of water, we can see that but can someone describe how the water
        - Why did they need a microscope, why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah STUDENT
        - Can you tell me um, what do you have figured out, can you explain that to me?
        - Okay STUDENT so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so
        - so you said that they have a small that they're using a small machine but
        - so what I would say um is that it seems like with our first the first answers that we had um what we were definitely coming up with
        - We want to talk about how we know that there's water on the moon and you'd mentioned, and your response STUDENT that scientists into small machine to discover water on the moon right?
        - Can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine
        - So when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon, and then does STUDENT know the definition of orbiter or orbit can anyone share that with me
        - Exactly exactly so when we combine those two things we're talking about something that goes around the moon right, so that is the equipment that NASA send or scientist sent to the moon
        - And it circles around the moon and analyzes data collected at the moon now one other item here, you know that that could be a little bit confusing is that so if this piece of machinery is
        - Not on the moon surface, how do you guys imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does anyone know that STUDENT
        - When astronauts do go outside of their spaceships they do need to utilize that equipment in order to you know, be able to breathe effectively in space because there isn't enough oxygen to breathe
        - And so you know, going back to how we found out that you are found evidence that there's water on the moon, is that you know they actually
        - Implemented a really interesting strategy, they basically threw a piece of the Atlas rocket at the moon
        - Yeah they did, and this caused a big crash
        - That sent a plume of dust 10 miles into the atmosphere from the moon surface and then, as we talked about that lunar orbiter it's in the air, you know circling the moon
        - And it was able to collect or analyze the dirt from that plume, and this is where your points STUDENT comes in
        - Which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5% water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play
        - You know, to Chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment, because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the Lunar orbiter the equipment and the STUDENT what's up
        - that's that is precisely it so we're not looking to discover water ourselves right on the moon we're leaving that up to NASA
        - what we're looking for is the equipment that's in the text that we read, so I want to turn now to some of your responses
        - Okay yeah that's STUDENT right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement, for me, certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon, but could you just clarify why you provided that response
        - some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that
        - What might be the effect that where we just read a text one time
        - Oh, my gosh yes you're absolutely right so
        - so can STUDENT explain to me how the water that was found on the moon, is perhaps different than the water that we have here on earth
        - But it's tiny right and it's actually in the soil within the craters so you couldn't see it if you were just looking at it you'd need the scientific equipment to analyze it more closely
        - So you know, I think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly, we may not catch STUDENT of these really fine details, I also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead
        - Or we can strengthen your responses
        - Okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it, you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay
        - and I would say that you're certainly right that a microscope is essential to see those microscopic water crystals
        - so STUDENT we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that
        - You wouldn't even know that it was there, why because it's microscopic and it's actually mixed within this soil and that really goes back to
        - you'll find that water inside the soil so it's actually invisible to the human eye and so okay yeah go ahead STUDENT
        - Farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil
        - Exactly, so there is not enough oxygen for us to breathe without oxygen tanks on the moon, and that actually brings up a fantastic point about
        - can anybody share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead STUDENT
        - So STUDENT so your answer was scientists found the crators full of water in the moon
        - So they use a not use a little
        - And as STUDENT was saying, small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon, yes
        - Water and moon by, but you can only look at in the human eye, so we just go look at your day I we weren't able to see it and
        - Very scientific tool to
        - yeah so that's quite I mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them
        - Okay did the scientists found the moon, I mean water in the moon?
        - Do they go to the moon? The astronauts? Or is it the machine was sent to moon? What do you think STUDENT?
        - When we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water, though, do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks
        - before they found that water What were they what tools, were they using to look in try to get that water out of the ground
        - yeah it doesn't necessarily say anything about astronauts, but it is a lot more fun to kind of imagine that there was astronauts in there up there
        - And I think when we hear the word NASA we our minds automatically are like Oh, we can think of the scientists and the scientists in spacesuits right that's what I think of at least I think of an astronaut
        - But lately, especially NASA has been using a lot of other tools and a lot of the other equipment, like some of the other things that we were talking about and the small machines, the Lunar orbiters STUDENT that you helped us find
        - And they have been able to send those things in space, instead of just people
        - Okay, so friends let's think we STUDENT seem to get really different answers and that's always so interesting there's A couple of words that I really wanted to focus on when we were thinking about our discussion questions when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something?
        - So um, for example, if I was going to start if I wanted to discover a new element or a new planet STUDENT we've been learning, you said you really like space and there's been a lot of planets that have been discovered recently right So if I, what do you think that means?
        - yeah so to to discover some things means to find or to locate something
        - I want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right, we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically
        - so um Farrah I saw I know that you thought you were thinking about the microscope and I love that you notice that, from what are one of the other paragraphs, the third paragraph right, it was Farrah and Oliver you STUDENT found that in the third paragraph yeah?
        - yeah so um I love that you STUDENT were thinking about them that equipment, because that is an important tool but  were they using it, the microscope to find it or to look at it
        - You don't know so i'm going to read you STUDENT, paragraph three, and then I would love to hear you guys I would love to hear if you guys think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it
        - Yes, that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right, so the water they found is super tiny, and if they want to see it, they would need to look really close with a microscope right
        - The lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do STUDENT
        - I want to focus on the word valuable specifically
        - so to be valuable is similar to what STUDENT said it to have great worth it to be worth a lot and that could be money like um how we think of it often or it can be in other ways
        - so um STUDENT you were talking about the parts of water; hydrogen and oxygen, why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable?
        - Um STUDENT I liked how you were thinking about the future and how we were talking about the future in our readings right that right now we can't do some of these things, but in the future, we might be able to
        - I want us to focus on how it could be valuable right now, like if we could just We could transport to the future and we're on the moon, and we have STUDENT these things, and we know that there's water there, what can we do what would be valuable about having water there, why would having water there be helpful for us, I want to draw your guys's attention to the fourth, yes, so the fourth paragraph
        - Just like you said STUDENT right?
        - so friends, what about other than just helping astronauts breathe, what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for?
        - um Oliver and Farrah and Chris you STUDENT read the fourth paragraph right What did you guys think could be useful, there are, what did that tell you about the water
        - So I want us to really think about how heavy water can be if water is really heavy and we have to send something STUDENT the way out into space Using lots of rocket fuel and we spend lots of money on that do you think it makes sense to try to carry up all of that stuff with us if we already have it on the moon?
        - Do you STUDENT think it would be helpful If we already had if we didn't have to Make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us, do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too
        - What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily
        - I would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways, could we use water, why is it valuable
        - Based on what you read, could you maybe tell me how they found the water, what did they use to find the water
        - A small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences STUDENT, what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was
        - yeah Chris that's exactly right, so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission, but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome, thank you for sharing that with me Chris, that was a great job let's see STUDENT
        - and you know I think deb also had a similar response right death
        - yeah and so we'll first let's see raise of hands, how many of you have used a microscope before
        - yeah right so in depth, maybe our friend, can you share with you some of their experiences, but like you said STUDENT microscopes are used to kind of blow things up and make them larger to our eyes that we can see them
        - Right and so that is correct it and they needed the microscope to see the water but they had to use something different find the water
        - mission that they had what they used was a piece of a rocket and they put that rocket into that piece into the crater which was
        - A big kind of like almost like an explosion of dirt and debris and dust and inside of that puff and cloud of debris and does
        - That is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water, but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound
        - yeah, and so I also want to circle back to STUDENT because Jazmin I think that you circled right away that NASA sent a small machine so did you notice that that's what they use to find the water
        - yeah right and but seeing STUDENT, you said you know so much about space, I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you, right after Luis okay
        - mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks, because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what
        - To breathe exactly, and so the question is asking about what the scientists use to discover the water because does STUDENT know what water is made up this might be a tricky question for some of us
        - Are you hearing person what is water, made up of
        - that's right h2o does STUDENT know what he stands for
        - Exactly that's exactly right and so that's why they're so excited for this discovery of water, because if they find water, then they can use the hydrogen and oxygen
        - to fuel the rockets, or they can use it to help us breathe so STUDENT that was correct in saying that the scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - But, did you understand that the question was asking how did they find the water and what did they use and so that's why STUDENT circle, the Lunar orbiter the small machine
        - You know what I think that's right dead and my research, I actually was able to watch a video about discovering water on the moon
        - So that's where I found that extra knowledge and maybe I could even share that video with you STUDENT some time to it seems like something you might be interested in
        - But, based on the text right you're right did they did not talk about the food in the text, so if we're looking back at the text and we're really thinking about the question
        - Right, the question doesn't ask us how did the scientists see the water, the question asked us what equipment that they use to discover the water
        - But what I want to help you and walk you through today is helping you to think about what exactly the question is asking you
        - wasting your own time, because we really want to think about moving forward in the future, how to answer questions to the best of our ability
        - Yes, I think equipment is a great word to circle
        - We're not asking how they got there, we're not asking how much water was that we're asking the question is asking what exactly did they use what equipment that's a great word i'm going to write that down on my paper as well, what equipment didt the scientists use?
        - Yes, exactly because equipment, again, that is a good word just circle because we're trying to figure out what object what tools they use to find
        - And the water, of course, that is the object that they were, that is what they were trying to find is the water so it's important to know
        - What equipment they used and what they were actually looking for and water like you said STUDENT is what they were looking for So yes, i'm also going to write your word down as well
        - yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case, does STUDENT remember reading that
        - Well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah STUDENT you can
        - Okay, and was there any other tools are parts that machine that helped it do that make it had to get it's STUDENT from the moon that you're talking to you had to discover some more ice so
        - Okay, so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks
        - The robot that STUDENT was mentioning for them, the small machine
        - What tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon
        - and where in the passage STUDENT, can we find one of those
        - Part Three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists
        - or revise I should say yeah STUDENT
        - Does STUDENT else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers
        - When you STUDENT read this article, what did you guys think was the most interesting parts of it?
        - Does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words?
        - Well let's think a little bit more clearly about that question right so we're trying to see what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right like you rephrased
        - so when the Lunar orbiter actually got there
        - I wonder if we could find out more about what tools it actually used to find the water, right?
        - Right so let's when we go back to the text, the microscope didn't get there on the on its own, and the Lunar orbiter didn't find the water on its own
        - what was the question actually asking us to determine about this NASA mission?
        - yeah awesome Okay, so how would you revise your answer to include that equipment part?
        - Okay, so that was evidence you got from your own experience
        - Did the did the NASA astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon, on its own?
        - yeah so STUDENT, why was the small machine so important in this example?
        - So looking back at the text, are there any other details that you might want to include now
        - So STUDENT, you also wrote your response about the microscope
        - So you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the Lunar orbiter to clarify
        - So STUDENT where were you getting that idea from because i'm
        - Okay, so if you got to -when you revise your response, what do you think you'll change?
        - STUDENT, you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, correct?
        - That was your answer correct?
        - STUDENT so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - What kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at?
        - Okay, so in our article that we had, talking about water on the moon, I agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found
        - I agree that is very difficult, but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope, how do we get the water?
        - Very good what's this small machine called?
        - Okay, so we're still thinking about that microscope right? What makes you think that they want to use a microscope?
        - Excellent so we're using the stuff that we're learning in science STUDENT and bringing it to this discussion right?
        - So we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon, when the microscope is used to dis-
        - Right, can you tell me what a desert is?
        - Right right a desert is really dry, so if we're saying the moon, is a desert, what are we saying there's not a lot of there?
        - Right so maybe there's not a lot of water
        - And now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water?
        - right they do and that's exactly what STUDENT told me right so Luis you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right?
        - Now they use these types of equipment for very specific things right? So an oxygen tank is something that we use when we can't breathe really well
        - And that is absolutely true scientists do use STUDENT those kinds of equipment
        - So if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon, like STUDENT the rest of our friends here said, think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon
        - You need different tools for different tasks right? STUDENT
        - I want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment
        - So you gave really great responses to this question
        - So STUDENT, do you want to try answering that question for us, what does equipment mean
        - So in this text, we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon, why do you guys think they needed to use equipment, why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands? Go ahead STUDENT
        - that's a great idea what type of equipment, do you think they would need to look at water
        - I want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists, be able to use the microscopes on the moon?
        - Have you ever used a microscope STUDENT
        - yeah and why did, why did NASA astronauts need STUDENT those things
        - What do they look like?
        - yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits
        - STUDENT, you said that you have used a microscope before right?
        - um so Oliver and Farrah, i'm going to come back to you STUDENT
        - So an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like STUDENT said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe, do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay
        - yeah right, so what type of other equipment, do you think they might need to make it a little easier to look at water
        - Is there something else that they maybe brought?
        - yeah that's, what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in? See they're numbered 1, 2, 3
        - Do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem?
        - So coming back to you Farrah so STUDENT helped you out, you pointed out this small machine
        - hi everyone i'm i'm so glad that everybody had shared their answer and I want to call on STUDENT could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer
        - Why would you need a microscope according to that sentence, what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence
        - So, yes you're 100% correct So if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover STUDENT of the water on the moon, or just bits and pieces of that water
        - Okay, so keep going so you were reading, paragraph two, and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the Lunar orbiter is for
        - Yes, and then What else does the Lunar orbiter do
        - Yes, and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text, which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph?
        - I want to combine STUDENT to answer with Luis's answer and kind of marry them together and the Lunar orbiter was a Chris was 100% correct when he said it's there to investigate right
        - And what it's investigating is what STUDENT shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit, what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits
        - So what can the Lunar orbiter help us find
        - and where they found the evidence in the tax alright
        - So um what makes you think that your answers wrong
        - Could you tell me where you found that in the text
        - So when I say go you STUDENT are going to pick up your pencils and work by yourself, look back in the text and really make sure that the evidence you put a circle around really has the specific equipment that is needed to find water on the moon
        - Tell me more, why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon
        - Yes, that's totally fair so on paragraph three i'm looking and everybody else should be looking in their texts that paragraph three, just so we can STUDENT look and think critically about this piece of evidence, to see if it matches our question um
        - You do need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so friends in those two sentences what I was looking at the words STUDENT around microscope
        - And that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry, excuse me, does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon
        - Is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is
        - STUDENT could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So if i'm looking right now, the text, if you want to show me where in the text it says that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks that would be helpful for me to understand
        - Okay, and that's correct, do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon
        - Correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water
        - No, no one said, your answers necessarily wrong, but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope
        - Is there a difference between you would need and
        - So do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read
        - That would be referring to us, we would need a microscope
        - So maybe there was another equipment that they used in order to discover the water
        - You said that NASA census small machine
        - Could you describe more this machine that they use
        - And what is the Lunar orbiter look for
        - And what is ice
        - Going back to you i'm wondering, do you see STUDENT so Jazmin talked about this lunar orbiter that is looking for frozen water on the moon does that sound like something that maybe
        - The scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Now, does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used
        - Did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it, maybe they would have to use a microscope
        - STUDENT Can you explain to me how you came to your answer
        - STUDENT What in the text drove you to your answer
        - Right so STUDENT where in the text did you find the microscope?
        - And Chris, do you want to, in the meantime, while Farrah and STUDENT reread the text, do you want to Talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon?
        - STUDENT have you found were in the story you want us to focus on
        - And then the sentence after it says this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits
        - Now ice, what is ice I guess
        - now in the microscope part this is kind of what Farrah and STUDENT were pointing out
        - Yes, perfect so ice is water
        - Perfect So what have you figured out
        - Would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope
        - But they can identify it without a microscope the machine can, but we cannot as humans
        - So what is confusing to you about that
        - These craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope
        - yeah well um I guess it's implied here that the Lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits
        - So um going back to the text and the question, so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, now, who are the scientists working with?
        - and they so we're looking for something with NASA right or scientists right, where it says scientists use or NASA used or sent or deployed or something where it says that the scientists are NASA right
        - yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with NASA
        - So we would need a microscope
        - Oh, and what is a microscope
        - What are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for
        - Has STUDENT seen a microscope before
        - And what do you use them for in science STUDENT
        - wow that's awesome and what kind of things, do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon, or the water, the frozen water
        - I just wanted to hear more about what you thought and to see if we can take your answers and to sort of expand them a little more
        - Get more detail in there
        - And I know you know, and I just need you to help me to understand
        - So, going back to the article, and now that we know about the microscope
        - What can you tell me about the machine that NASA sent to the moon? The lunar orbiter
        - Oh great, and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like I don't know anything about the ice crater so I need you to explain it to me oh
        - But how would you describe an ice crater if
        - I know they're deep their dark they have ice in them
        - What do you think they look like?
        - but are they like the grand Canyon like deep holes in the ground
        - yeah so it's a, it is a hole off the ground, it's kind of elevated
        - Oh yeah that's interesting, how do you think you could work that into your answer
        - What else did you learn about the moon from the article
        - And what is a microscope
        - And why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon
        - So how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article
        - So NASA sent a small machine, why did they send the machine?
        - Okay, well, do you think you could tell me what the microscope does?
        - And how it relates to finding water
        - Like Why were they using a microscope to look at the water? What were they were hoping to find?
        - What background knowledge do you want to add to your answer? Did you read your answer?
        - Well, can you tell me what they use the oxygen tanks for and how it connects to the rest of the article?
        - Because it's about trying to find water on the moon
        - Could you tell me a little more about how they're going about looking for water on the moon, and why they're looking for water on the moon?
        - So um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon
        - Yeah that's true very good point
        - Ok, well why do you think they were going there to look for water?
        - Why wouldn't it make sense?
        - Okay, what are you confused about?
        - So were there other things, that the astronauts used to look for water, other than the microscope?
        - Ok so you both said the small machine
        - yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope?
        - Yes, actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that STUDENT because, looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um I think that that is a great observation I was wondering where you saw that in the text
        - That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that STUDENT
        - STUDENT yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text
        - So how do we, have you ever used the microscope before
        - So if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away, just like the water on the moon that far away
        - Yes, I think they're really cool
        - Right that's what i'm thinking like maybe maybe not
        - So what do you think help the scientists
        - And I don't want you to answer it now, I want you to take a second to look through the text again, but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it
        - Okay, and Oliver you had something, you have a similar idea as STUDENT so, can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion
        - How can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right, because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for STUDENT these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time, so we have to look at the text
        - The goal is to pro right so similar to my um NASA with the microscope when they have the microscope It means that they're looking at something very specific right
        - But there's a situation there's something that they have to do, prior to that to where it's very broad, so your answer was was
        - and STUDENT, you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon go ahead yeah go ahead i'm listening
        - yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the Lunar orbiter and, if you look inside the word lunar where do you see
        - cool great so we see the word Luna or moon Thank you STUDENT inside of lunar I also want to think about the word polar craters what word, do you see inside of the word polar
        - Okay, and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of STUDENT
        - uh huh and so, if we're looking at polar craters on the moon, where are they going to be located
        - What is it telling us STUDENT, I appreciate you so much that your hand shoots up right away
        - Okay, and what is inside of the creators STUDENT
        - What are we learning from this paragraph
        - Great so, can you tell me more about what the Lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing
        - So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two
        - What is NASA specifically sending in paragraph to
        - To do what STUDENT
        - Good so i'm going to add that, to my visualization I know NASA which STUDENT knows so much about
        - amazing and an orbiter which i'm imagining looks something like a rocket into one of the polar craters will find water good let's look at paragraph three together
        - The water they found is microscopic hold on i'm going to pause there the water they found who found that water
        - Where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water? Can either Oliver or STUDENT read that sentence for us?
        - I saw you STUDENT had some consensus
        - So why don't we start with Oliver and STUDENT
        - Thank you, thank you
        - In the sentence STUDENT read, are the scientists, what are they using the microscope for?
        - Can you tell us where in the text STUDENT you found this information?
        - Thank you STUDENT for reading from the text
        - So now we have two ideas on the table that it was a microscope or this small machine
        - Um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine? STUDENT you have a hand up
        - What is the small machine called? let's give it a name
        - STUDENT do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people
        - So these are tools, people can use
        - So STUDENT brought up a great point what equipment means
        - Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text
        - Our items, did STUDENT see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found
        - I'm seeing a shake head from STUDENT
        - Soo it sounds like the two pieces of equipments we heard were microscopes and the lunar orbiter
        - So the question i'm hearing is we kind of agree, yes, that this thing was used to investigate it, but we still need the microscope to look closely at it
        - But they did need the microscope to look closely at it, but for that first discovery, what did they need?
        - So STUDENT excellent analysis
        - And what made you think that from the passage?
        - But before, before you look at the water closely, how did NASA say that they found they could find the water on the moon?
        - Can you think of, can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water?
        - Right, so I think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon
        - it's not wrong, maybe let's look at that part together, can you tell us where you saw that in the passage?
        - Did STUDENT catch what it was called?
        - mm hmm so they use this lunar orbiter to try to investigate and to explore the moon's South pole
        - So that's why it said NASA sent that machine to try to find evidence of water, through the ice craters
        - But I think, looking at the passage as a whole, we need to look at what, how they even could get that water sample
        - right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it
        - so let's listen why don't you jump in STUDENT is the would you say the moon is dry, or is the moon wet, what do you think
        - That are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water, they have not found just lots of water in the moon, the moon is one of the driest places in the world
        - Yes, I love that you brought the grand Canyon because that's honestly how I picture the moon, sometimes, because the moon, is very dry dry place but, just like the grand Canyon
        - When we go there  we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice, so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place
        - Yes, you're right right, so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know, maybe you guys have used microscopes in your STUDENT before
        - and so, with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to STUDENT what they need oxygen tanks on the moon
        - Yes, you're right you're right they needed to breathe right because they don't have Like the oxygen like we breathe in the air, they don't have that on the moon
        - That they need the Lunar orbiter right and at some point they're going to be the microscope to me I love that you mentioned that and then you STUDENT brought up also that they're going to need some oxygen tanks
        - Who could give me a quick summary of the text? two to three sentences
        - Alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read
        - Okay, can you tell me how they found it
        - Okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence
        - STUDENT where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope? where exactly in the story?
        - Can you tell us where exactly, that is, you can read the sentence for us
        - STUDENT is telling us that in paragraph three, there's a microscopic material that you would need a microscope to see
        - I want STUDENT to think, and then you're going to get a chance to vote is it a microscope that found the water on the moon, or is it the Lunar orbiter that found the water on the moon
        - Could you explain to the STUDENT, one of you, why you think that is what it was called?
        - I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and STUDENT raise their hand for the lunar orbiter
        - STUDENT pointed us to the exact sentence in the story that told us what the machine was called
        - He shared that they use these tools and the Lunar orbiter is one of the tools that they use
        - Okay, so I want to circle back to STUDENT Farrah
        - Do you now see what the name of that tool was called?
        - Okay, and STUDENT you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon
        - Okay, so i'm noticing STUDENT that you are looking to, you're giving us like the definition of the water that they are finding is really, really small, and that is absolutely right
        - Is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool
        - do you see the name of that tool there in the text
        - Okay, so STUDENT just pointed us to a different part of the text that we can investigate
        - I want STUDENT to go back to Part two of the text and this time you're reading those first two sentences to see if that is the name of the tool that found the water
        - Do we find the name of the tool that found the water on the moon
        - That is absolutely right and in this question, we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon,
        - one thing we want to pinpoint, though, is figuring out what's the difference between the types of tools they're talking about
        - and then it also talks about, later in the text, the microscope
        - and as STUDENT pointed out, it said they sent the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it landed on the moon and found some ice deposits, where the water was, right
        - was the Lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water
        - so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found
        - and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small
        - so before we dive into the question I want to ask one of you, what is your understanding of the word equipment, what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily lights
        - Farrah, can you tell me do you want to read out your answer, maybe we can all decide as a STUDENT, we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so Can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that
        - I read that you have the same answer STUDENT What was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason
        - Okay amazing our event, so you don't you know a lot about science and space so Can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did, and what do you think of your peers on so so far
        - For me, loud and maybe you can explain to us again what led you to choosing your answer
        - lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off
        - awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence
        - All the actually says very clear in the second paragraph, can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as NASA sent the small machine and what is that called STUDENT
        - Good and that was the outcome right, we now know that they found water and we now know the water actually exist in the moon, which is really fascinating
        - And also that actually ties into Luis's experience Luis knows STUDENT about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right, even
        - hard to find an answer from
        - awesome great great great so um is STUDENT said, is that the reason why you chose the same answer
        - I really so good good STUDENT right now so have you heard about this story before, or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah
        - Shall we just go back and see together since I didn't go with three other answers, so we could definitely do that so STUDENT, can you tell us what the paragraph, you find the answer from
        - How do you know that, how do you know that the answer actually is, in the second paragraph
        - The answer is located in a paragraph two, and it's not too difficult and because it says NASA send a small machine called the Lunar orbiter to investigate right and
        - yeah and then it was confusing at first, because, as you said, it is a small machine
        - but what did the text makes you think that was the answer
        - Right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again?
        - Paragraph three so you got the word microscopic which looks really important right
        - And then, it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools, who may just think that it was a scientific tool, the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but
        - That I love that question and then what it does, that that's another scientific tool that's another equipment, but they use it to
        - And I can tell you that, because it tells you directly in the paragraph to
        - And the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water, so I know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay
        - So you thought about Jazmin's answer and then
        - But sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so Luis if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question, can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain, because you knew STUDENT about space
        - Right so who knows, just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about
        - You got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do
        - Okay you're right good can you read us the sentence, where you where you got that
        - So what was that small machine called
        - So do you think you could add something to your answer STUDENT to make it more complete in more correct
        - Because what did the Lunar orbiter do
        - STUDENT, you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment, but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or
        - Did you STUDENT watch the movie about how the Lunar orbiter worked
        - Okay, so Are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry, are they telling us, we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small, we would need a microscope
        - Maybe, starting with STUDENT Luis could you explain how you came to your answer choice
        - So it's fantastic that you already know about space, but for today we're kind of looking at your ability to read and pull out information So could you take a look at your answer STUDENT
        - whoa Okay, why are they definitely using oxygen tanks
        - Oh, so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water
        - can you tell me a little bit more, what do you think are astronauts and scientists one in the same?
        - Was that a question or a statement?
        - so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else?
        - it's asking us to answer this question based on what we read in the article
        - But in this case are we looking for information from your brain, or are we looking for information from the article?
        - So what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer
        - i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you STUDENT had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice
        - STUDENT, can you tell me a little bit more What do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now
        - So what do you know about a microscope
        - that's I mean you're absolutely both of you are right that it's something that you, you need to use to find something that is very small
        - But if we look, does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon, or that the water is kind of buried underneath
        - Very good, so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this, to try and find STUDENT of that water
        - Do you remember the name of the small machine
        - I want you to take just a quick second and read over just the first paragraph of the text again and, if you think of any questions or any parts that seem confusing to you I would love to hear them so just take a minute and scan over just the first paragraph one more time
        - Great job Thank you so I noticed in the first paragraph that it talks about craters that's a difficult vocabulary word does someone know what a crater is
        - yeah absolutely a crater is sort of like a whole or a well that might have filled up with water, it sounds like that's what happened in this article
        - It also says that a crater is a dark place where the sun never shines we can learn STUDENT of that from just the beginning of our reading about the moon
        - Now that you have a little bit of a better idea of what a crater is, do you think a crater is a piece of equipment that scientists would use to find water?
        - STUDENT i'm seeing your head shaking no to, why do you think no
        - looks like STUDENT saying no, it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos
        - So take a look at the second paragraph, read it over again quickly and then we're going to talk about it again
        - We know it's a small machine, but if my machine could be anything, how can we get a little bit of a better idea of what a lunar orbiter is
        - STUDENT Thank you so much for sharing that Luna does mean moon so when you hear the word lunar it's going to have something to do with the moon,
        - just like now is the Lunar New Year it's the complete cycle of the moon
        - orbiter just like STUDENT said, has to do with going around
        - if you look back in your text, you can see that it looks for ice deposits in the crater
        - Jazmin told us that it was a small machine and STUDENT added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon,
        - STUDENT could you tell your classmates How was it that they found that there was water on the moon
        - And STUDENT did the machine which is called the Lunar orbiter, by the way, did that have a microscope on it
        - They they kind of gloss over the fact that there's a step between the Lunar orbiter orbiting that part of the moon, making contact with that part of the moon
        - What what's that step in between so STUDENT, can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the Lunar lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that Farrah
        - Why is it called the Lunar lunar orbiter, by the way, why, why is it that it's called that you think no it wasn't an article but STUDENT
        - cool that that's exactly the two pieces of equipment that they mentioned in the article So what does the Lunar orbiter do
        - let's let's take a step back STUDENT What did you get what What did you get from this article what what did this article tell you, especially you know you're our in house space expert
        - For you, you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article
        - Yes, you could you could definitely say that they sent to lunar orbiter to investigate and what exactly why did they have to send the Lunar orbiter what what's the purpose of the Lunar orbiter and what what is it really besides, a small machine
        - STUDENT, how did you feel about this article, and what what sense, did you get from it
        - So STUDENT, do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea, do you think we're ready to do that, you know, in a year you think we're set up for that well
        - You know, being able to leverage and to use the resources on the moon, the natural resources, like the water that was recently found
        - really is something that it's going to that's going to be number one very difficult and number two it's going to be a long time, you know the technology and the science does not exist, to be able to do this yet
        - is there, something else is, is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money, in particular, that you see in the art in paragraph six
        - that's right they don't and and so, since they don't know what would they have to do to be able to get it out
        - that's right that's right and now, so why does that, why does building new equipment How does that tie together to time and money
        - in the text, they said that the scientists use a microscope because microscopes are used to look at things that are really, really tiny
        - And the water molecules on the moon were really tiny STUDENT I saw your hand go up earlier, did you have something to add
        - yeah they did I remember reading that as well does STUDENT remember what it was called
        - Has STUDENT heard those words before
        - Do you know what they mean, you know what lunar means?
        - Yes, it does and what what does something do when it orbits
        - Exactly yeah it's when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually yeah STUDENT do you have something to add
        - So the Lunar orbiter is in space and it uses a telescope or a camera to look for these water particles, but the water particles are microscopic they're really, really tiny, so the scientist has to use the microscope as well, to be able to see them
        - yeah that's a great clarifying question I was a little unclear as well, but from what I understand it sounds like they just use the equipment and to find a water on the moon, and the scientists were controlling it from earth and that so they used
        - the equipment to find the water
        - They might have been on the space station, or something that was also in space, but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work
        - Fellow peers about maybe some other responses and we can build your understanding of the resources that I provided you with the texts that we learned about how to answer a question, using a nonfiction text
        - What can you tell me about your answer
        - do we remember what the small machine was called
        - Maybe look in your text it says it in the
        - deb I think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right
        - Well that's Okay, now we know that the question, the key word was the equipment,
        - so do you see how you could add more to your answer and use the question and the keywords to find what kinds of things we want to use to answer
        - Do you see them in in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment
        - Very good yeah so we can use the text as a resource to find her answers yeah
        - Um STUDENT why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - did you find any any convincing evidence in the text to support that it can be valuable
        - why, why did you say that?
        - So what are you confused about are you confused about the question or the reading?
        - so STUDENT thought that it could be valuable
        - Well, there you at the end of the paragraph, it says you decide so it's your opinion on whether or not you think it's valuable
        - And maybe you don't think that that's a good investment so there can be multiple answers it's STUDENT about your opinions as long as you support it
        - yeah tell me why you why you said that
        - So so let's start with your response STUDENT, you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, I wonder what made you see that
        - Oh that's how you thought about it and there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you STUDENT remember reading the article, the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen
        - Water yeah that's that makes water so um STUDENT said that scientists found creators, full of water on moon right is that what you read hi Chris
        - so what kind of a
        - I think your answer is very close to what we're looking for, but i'm wondering what made you think that they would be needing a microscope
        - how did they discover that they'd be requiring a microscope
        - yeah that's that's a good like I really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with STUDENT so Jazmin how did you find out about that what What did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different
        - So i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said, even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you STUDENT I think you had a very interesting thought, but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question
        - so STUDENT um tell me a little bit more about your response, what makes you think that the water, the creators are full of water
        - so STUDENT I noticed that you have mentioned microscope as your equipment
        - Why did you do that
        - Okay, so now we have the name of the machine and it looks for ice deposits, and can you make a connection to the microscope now STUDENT
        - And it is at maybe and the deposits are optimized on the size of the deposit is microscopic
        - that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen so I want to understand how this is going to be valuable
        - Okay, so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful, and also to refine your answer further
        - Thank you so much for staying um STUDENT I read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that
        - Would you like to share more about your conclusion
        - Can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to
        - Okay, so you have identify a bit I identified a benefit that the spaceship would be lighter which is by, it is worth it for us to continue with this exploration
        - And STUDENT has also identified a benefit so let's hear what Jazmin had to say
        - Okay, think it's a benefit because there is water on an astronaut's name need water for their hydration
        - I really value how some of you have talked about the benefits of this exploration, whereas the other people like Dave and someone I have talked about the costs of this exploration
        - Right there's water on the moon super interesting and what does that mean? Now that they found water on the moon, what can happen up there?
        - Or what do scientists think we'll be able to do one day?
        - Awesome, yes equipment right
        - So now we know that the answer that we're looking for is going to be a piece of equipment, right?
        - Okay, so now we have STUDENT of these big important words that we need to use to figure out what the answer is going to be so we know the answer is going to be a piece of equipment right and it's the piece of equipment that was used to discover it
        - Well, what okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do STUDENT you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it, what do you
        - Okay So did we we read about those things in the paragraphs, though? Did they talk about that in the paragraph?
        - No, so they definitely use those things but we're trying to find the information from the paragraph, so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph? STUDENT
        - A small machine will, what was the name of the small machine
        - STUDENT, why do you think that's the right answer
        - Can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists?
        - So you just told me when the scientists found the ice already, and then they couldn't see it
        - So our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon, which is how they found it at first, right?
        - Why do they need to microscope again?
        - So let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it, and then they can use the microscope to see it
        - I feel you have a great evidence, can you tell me more about this machine?
        - mm hmm so the name of this machine is lunar orbiter
        - yeah great and, what is this machine for?
        - yeah and that's how this little machine, the small machine works right?
        - What do you think? How the Lunar orbiter helps to find the little ice deposits?
        - STUDENT, can you help us read the sentence about lunar orbiter?
        - Why don't we look at it STUDENT together right now
        - Why do you think we call it an orbiter?
        - STUDENT, do you know why they call it an orbiter?
        - Yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar crater
        - STUDENT, what do you want to say?
        - Great and STUDENT talked about the oxygen tanks right?
        - Those are STUDENT great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right?
        - So oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe
        - But what exactly helped the scientists find the water?
        - If we have oxygen but not this small machine, the Lunar orbiter, can we find the ice?
        - and the Lunar orbiter is specifically for this purpose right?
        - so let's take a look at some of your answers STUDENT and we actually started with you um you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - answer too, he said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon, so they used STUDENT the that equipment and the eating that terrible food
        - And they they used STUDENT that over a course of you know, probably many months, and they and they somehow found
        - I'm curious STUDENT, do you remember any actual equipment that they use
        - Do you remember how they found the water in those craters
        - Water in those craters which is really exciting, because when I was your age, we didn't even know that there was water in craters on anywhere
        - STUDENT, can you explain a little bit more about that for me
        - Well let's talk about Farrah's and Oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes
        - mm hmm that's right and STUDENT you are, you are thinking, the same thing right
        - Have you ever used the microscope before
        - Mike, their first microscopes my wife's a scientist and then we bought them their first microscope and watching them using microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look and look into
        - yeah awesome so I guess what i'm wondering is, if you have to use the microscope and you, you have that already have something available to put on those slides
        - And so i'm wondering how did they get that water in the first place that actually maybe brings us to STUDENT
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA sent a small machine to go get that water
        - And then maybe that's how they brought it back to use the microscopes or maybe they haven't even gotten to that part yet
        - and do you think STUDENT, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking
        - This small machine, so we've talked about other machines, but I think she's thinking about the one that actually like got
        - and see what you can find, see if we can go a little a little deeper okay so see if you can identify that small machine that she's talking about let's get started
        - What are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words ,but what what is the Lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean? STUDENT
        - Maybe this machine, the small machine this lunar orbiter as STUDENT said wasn't actually going into the crater maybe it was just going around the moon
        - But that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon, and not actually going in the crater how, how does it find the ice it's in the crater
        - STUDENT do you have any thoughts on that
        - In the large polar crater
        - Remember polar is like the top and the bottom just kind of like the North Pole but you're right it actually doesn't talk about at least in that paragraph how the Lunar orbiter works right
        - that's good and Chris it's nice to meet you well let's take a look at the article that we have here again, it is on spaces eaten pointed out, which I find super exciting STUDENT find super exciting
        - But before we even look at the article again and start our discussion, what do you think are the I don't know, maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you got you thinking
        - and I mean we're talking about the moon right we got to know where we're talking about so it's not all of spaces it's about the moon in particular ours is there, maybe one other yes STUDENT
        - Okay, good if you look at the article, can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about NASA spending, excuse me, sending not spending sending a small machine
        - Perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer NASA send a small machine, if you are going to level that up like a video game, if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer, how might you get a little bit more clarity there
        - does that machine have a name
        - kind of answers that question right to to discover water on the moon, and then you named it, I think that might be that might be
        - Well, I don't know if i'd call it a machine, but you, you talked about a scientific tool right
        - do you want to tell me a little bit more about that oh
        - what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it
        - hmm because thinking about Jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists
        - mm hmm that's true and where's STUDENT Do you remember, where the microscope part was
        - You wouldn't need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely,
        - What are your thoughts about how the scientists actually found
        - Okay well well, what did you figure out a bit curious to hear
        - I just want to make sure that you understand why oxygen tanks might not be the best answer for this question can you explain your thinking a little bit
        - yeah I think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer, what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well
        - Tell me a little bit more about that
        - Okay, what are you confused about STUDENT
        - Yes, exactly Oliver awesome job so they found water on the moon right so there's h2o there's hydrogen and there's oxygen on the moon so kind of giving us what what STUDENT talked about
        - Why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts are these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon
        - yeah they could drink it and then like STUDENT said there's hydrogen and oxygen right so maybe they can use the oxygen in the water  To get some air, so that they can breathe right
        - Okay, so your answer may not, that is not necessarily wrong, what did we talk about micro or microscopic that mean what does that mean, can you explain
        - really, really, really small, so we do need a special tool and that special tool
        - What did you find important about the small machine
        - detectives right and so detected they look for things right, and so that's pretty much what the what NASA wanted to do they wanted to send this small
        - This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um STUDENT else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important
        - yeah definitely they have to use all those things right, why do you STUDENT think it's important for them to wear their masks and their suits when they go to outer space
        - right because there's a lack of oxygen up in space right, and if you don't have oxygen and you won't be able to breathe so it'd be really tough for them to go to outer space
        - um i'm interested to hear um you know a little bit more about this small machine, why do you think maybe any ideas as to why they sent a small machine instead of a really big one
        - But when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there
        - Okay, why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this STUDENT, because you don't know you already know about space
        - cool, How did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water
        - Right, what, why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though
        - So yeah, we could say that's one of the tools that's necessary for them to even go to the moon, are there any other tools
        - okay Nice nice So what do we use a microscope for
        - yeah so your answer is not necessarily wrong I love again how you use the, how you use the word microscope, um can you think of like another instance or another time or another example, when we use a microscope
        - it's full of these craters that have the water in them right, but a lot of times if we try to use a microscope maybe we don't maybe there's too many places for us to look right,
        - or can STUDENT else help us out, they did find these, They did find these craters right
        - and think about maybe going to a family member's house there's a certain way that you get there
        - Right um so yeah NASA they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine, maybe um
        - can STUDENT think of another word that they may know of that has the same meaning as investigate
        - hmm so investigate right find right are great words, Oliver the same thing that you said, right STUDENT of those had that same kind of kind of meaning right
        - Oliver, about the investigators, right and Farrah about about the scientific tools about the looking and the searching piece and Luis about STUDENT the equipment that we know that astronauts have to use,
        - then STUDENT, what do you think they could do once they really find that location where they know that they're really sure that there's probably gonna be some water
        - To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water STUDENT do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon
        - that's really observant of you i'm wondering if the specific question is looking for more of the equipment that they're using
        - So here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that, based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do, you still think that there is a crater full of water, what do you think
        - so STUDENT, would you be able to tell me what evidence from the text led you to believe that they used a microscope to find the underwater
        - mm hmm Okay, so this is actually perfect for both you Farrah and STUDENT since you had very similar answers
        - That helps us to see if we were going in the right direction with our answer
        - Okay STUDENT Can you help me what is your confusion, is it the question?
        - In this context, it looks like the specific question you STUDENT identified some verbs you identified the verb to discover, and there was also this word about equipment used to discover so
        - In this context, it seems like we should be zoning our eyes into the the reading and looking specifically for a tool, or a piece of equipment that's used to do some kind of discovering
        - Is that the robot that searched on the planet, can you read that whole section again for me
        - Thank you, so if you see with her response what we're looking for is an actual piece of equipment that did the discovery and can you see how Jazmin's
        - Absolutely STUDENT I guess, I want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space
        - Or is a more of once the water is found, then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount, what would you say
        - but did you do that second part where you circled information in the text
        - awesome what did you find in that sentence
        - What is lunar orbiter what is a lunar orbiter
        - So do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger?
        - I love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right, but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job STUDENT really good work
        - Alright, so what is it really asking for, what information does it want to know
        - Are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use?
        - that's true what kind of equipment, or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for
        - Great so what was that part of the text telling us
        - Does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon
        - Yes, you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right
        - yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit NASA or are we looking somewhere else for our answer
        - Where in the text, they figured out how to answer this question about equipment
        - Okay, and do you have a specific sentence
        - Okay, and were you looking at a specific sentence
        - What is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place, what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question death
        - It does need to be a thing, and what made you say that
        - Now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so def has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for
        - Okay, so let's talk about this Jazmin your answer was that NASA sent a small machine right, and I think we can STUDENT agree that a small machine is a type of equipment right
        - But, as you and STUDENT also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is
        - That was used to discover water on the moon, and I want us to take a minute and go through and find a sentence that answers a piece of equipment and equipment that specifically was Hughes to discover water on the moon
        - That is absolutely true our scientists are using a lot of equipment, which is why it's going to be kind of tricky for us to just narrow it down
        - And I want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water, so do we think that, looking at water and discovering water are the same, are they different
        - Alright, everyone, I think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something STUDENT Can you help me oh
        - Great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident
        - And what made you pick this particular sentence STUDENT
        - STUDENT right, i'm seeing some nods, so I think we're really onto something here, and I agree, I think this is a phenomenal sentence to us to answer our question can Somebody tell me the two things that this sentence have that our question is looking for
        - Great yes, so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question  right it gives us a piece of equipment, the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something STUDENT
        - Can you tell me why you're confused
        - The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water
        - right they didn't know where it was now in order for us to use a microscope do we if we're using it to look at the water do we already have the water
        - Okay, so we need the water already if we're going to use the microscope
        - So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water?
        - right they're asking for two different things we're seeing a lot of really similar words
        - This is a great start, we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence STUDENT
        - What if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at NASA figured out that there is water on the moon, which is super exciting What would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents, based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery
        - STUDENT you mentioned a microscope right?
        - The story is that when when the satellite went up there, they decided to take part of their rocket and crashed into the moon into a crater and then a big plume Do you know what a plume is
        - Right, so they they hypothesized, but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume, then we can send our we can send
        - And you can you can you see the text, right now, Oliver do you look at the can STUDENT see the tax that i'm talking about
        - so um STUDENT was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes, she did not the right answer, but she needs to be more specific, so I just looked at her sentence
        - So if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right, so that they could discover this water STUDENT and you find something yeah okay
        - Right, so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water
        - But this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers, so our group is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today STUDENT
        - What paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - that's awesome STUDENT, can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope
        - yeah awesome so one of the tools that the scientist used to look at the microscopic water was a microscope
        - Which paragraph from the text did you get your answer from?
        - awesome so STUDENT, can you tell me what the small machine was called?
        - awesome so this small machine was called the Lunar orbiter- STUDENT, what did NASA do with that machine?
        - yeah does STUDENT know what investigate means?
        - yeah awesome STUDENT and that's exactly what investigate means so NASA used the Lunar orbiter to look around the moon for water
        - yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere STUDENT
        - Thank you Luis so STUDENT I haven't heard your voice in a while Farrah does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used?
        - yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned
        - So something I want to share with all of you is all of your almost all of your responses had something to do with equipment and STUDENT you're right in that we're talking about the equipment used to discover so
        - Okay um So could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the Lunar orbiter
        - so what lets the scientists, know that the water is there
        - STUDENT you say that you still think that the microscope is the most important part right
        - After you thought, and you have a good solid thought let's share, what does that mean
        - I want you each to take 30 seconds and just think about what are other words that might mean the same thing as equipment, so what might be a synonym
        - A word that means the same thing as equipment i'm going to give you 30 minutes 30 seconds right now to just jot down some notes write down some notes about what might be a word that means the same thing as equipment okay go ahead and do that now
        - tool that's a good one yeah so tool, a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job Farrah and STUDENT, I saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment
        - yeah something you use to complete a job and that's really almost like savannas tool right it's a tool, something that we use to complete a job so two different ways of saying equipment there
        - So a machine is another word for equipment that's a great
        - So just to remind STUDENT for equipment, we have a tool, a thing we use to complete a job and also a machine so lots of different ways to think about equipment
        - So we're going to spend another 30 seconds doing the same thing with the word discover okay so spend 30 seconds writing down other words that might mean the same thing as discover okay go ahead and do that now
        - Find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then STUDENT I saw your hand go up what did you come up with Luis
        - yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time, so you're finding it for the first time, good thanks STUDENT in depth, those are really good words to point up
        - yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it, or you don't know if it's there, and you uncover it that's very good yes
        - And here's in brings up a good point that that's exactly what our question is asking us for and what we want to learn from this text what tools are the scientists
        - And how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon
        - Oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and
        - Oh awesome he found it in part three
- intent: 300
  examples: |
        - awesome so Farrah and STUDENT get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so A+  direction for following points
        - amazing yeah I love that and and I love that you are you agree with Farrah and you're adding more to the answer and together, you STUDENT have collaborated on Even better answer
        - and I love that you STUDENT are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help equipment that allow us to discover water on the moon You come up with your answer and I think we already, so now we have identified two different equipments and you guys were able to build on each other's answers to
        - yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was method mentioned in the text, which is very good, as well
        - I love that you brought in that background knowledge STUDENT that fact about some about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge
        - Okay, so you read it in the story I love that you found it in the story
        - yeah so I love that you picked up on the microscope because it's really important when we're thinking about the word microscopic
        - yeah so STUDENT I love what you know about NASA and you're using evidence from the reading
        - yeah I love, how you summarize that are STUDENT, alright, So I love, how you summarize the article Chris
        - yeah STUDENT that's awesome background knowledge, thank you for bringing that background knowledge so
        - yeah so I love that you both know that microscopes are used to look at small things and that you were able to pull that out of the text
        - So um STUDENT what you did was you definitely got the answer correct
        - right, you, you know you know what sort of equipment scientists use to discover equipment on the moon uh to discover water on the moon
        - Absolutely yeah no, these are STUDENT great observations about how our thinking can change by sort of learning a new piece
        - I really like how you use your background knowledge to answer that question
        - So I am sure that you are going to do a great job when we look back for this specific tool because you probably heard of it before
        - Yeah, I am so glad that you know so much about space
        - Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that
        - So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet
        - That's a good way of thinking about it, STUDENT
        - You did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer
        - And you still address the equipment part of the question, and I appreciate that
        - That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer
        - I like your revised answer and that you STUDENT work so well together
        - But yeah, she did a great job and you were very specific also
        - I see your line of thought and I really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine, which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out, or to see
        - And I appreciate that answer
        - You did a great job using your background knowledge and using STUDENT the information that was in our text
        - That was one of our right answers
        - It was a right answer
        - Well, I appreciate that
        - I can see what you're thinking, and where you were going with that
        - And I really like the fact that you use those contexts clues and explain to me what extracting meant
        - So I appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's  It's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable
        - Reading You told us that extracting was getting the water out and I see where you use that evidence, saying that it might take a lot of time and money
        - Because it's possible that we could get it from the moon and I see Chris's thinking was, he said that water is very heavy
        - I can see how it would be very useful to leave behind STUDENT that weight because we may be able to find that water and use water on the moon and not have to carry that would be valuable
        - Um, so I can see STUDENT I appreciate the fact that you see value in that because it would be a valuable source
        - You did a good job
        - Yeah, you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence
        - Yes, that is our this the two words that we really want to focus on,
        - That's a very good point
        - So you could circle convincing evidence together
        - Yeah, that's a great idea
        - And we always want to make sure that we're looking forward
        - Even if it's not valuable right now
        - Like you just said in your answer that it would be valuable in the future
        - Now, but in the future
        - So like you said you have a good, you have a good point that it may not be valuable
        - I love that STUDENT, use the text when she found her answer and I wonder if
        - I love that you cited where you found it in the text
        - So STUDENT, you said you need a specific tool called a microscope to look really closely which is absolutely true
        - Instead of saying equipment like the question did you just said tool
        - And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing
        - You told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely
        - I'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to, because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from
        - Scientists have found craters full of water on the moon, and that is absolutely true
        - STUDENT, you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out
        - And I'm really proud of you for finding that
        - Oh, what a nice way to explain that
        - Oh, I see where you're talking about it says the water they found is microscopic so I mean right, it's very small
        - Which is great and you STUDENT refer back to the text
        - You got to the three of you have listed science equipment right which you that is that first part of the question
        - Well, you know, those are pieces of equipment that they use
        - That's a some awesome prior knowledge STUDENT
        - So I can add a bit of background info here
        - Um, so, STUDENT Can you give me another example of equipment, maybe something from that article that we just read that you know that NASA is using in space
        - And you offer a lot of insight,
        - That's, that's my, my fault there so, Instead, I should have said, the way you answer that I see where you're coming from
        - Well, maybe I phrased that poorly
        - I think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in
        - I think that's very good
        - I like your use of detail there
        - And that's, that's very good
        - I'm glad you're able to get that sort of perspective on it
        - You give really good strong details on that very specific part
        - So I can kind of see your enjoyment there now a way we can sort of improve or something we might want to see is
        - Okay, that's, that's great
        - I think you've got the main idea
        - And so at the heart of your answer there
        - We found some water on the moon
        - Thank you very much for listening
        - Those are very good listening skills and making sure you're always being an active learner and to I think you really took to heart
        - So I appreciate that
        - That was very good
        - What I said there
        - Why it doesn't say anything about water and that's a great point there but
        - That's right, they, you know, they, they are very valuable and I like how you pointed that out
        - But when we look back at the question
        - Okay, awesome, and I love how Deb's original response was that he found the same as STUDENT, that shows that Oliver is able to make a connection with his classmate and relate his thinking to Farrah thinking
        - And that's a good skill
        - I love how Farrah Oliver Chris and STUDENT were able to look specifically in the text
        - To use our background knowledge like STUDENT used in to make inferences using our background knowledge and what the text tells us, right
        - We want to make inferences and use our use our prior knowledge that's very important
        - Yes, those are some things from your personal experience, and we do get information from our personal experience
        - What you did a great job finding the first part of the sentence
        - Good thinking, because we are talking about water
        - We are talking about the moon, but there are a few more
        - Well, I appreciate it, that you added that detail for us
        - Water is a valuable resource right
        - One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section
        - Because that has the words we were just talking about
        - So that was just the right place to look for that
        - And you did find some evidence, didn't you
        - All right, let's see, when you STUDENT are doing a great job with talking through this and working through it together and you know where to find the right place to look
        - So you guys are STUDENT given really good details
        - So you STUDENT are given really good details for that
        - I've seen that you remembered a detail from the passage
        - Because I agree with you that no, maybe it's not a good investment
        - So I think that you justified your answer and
        - So I think that you and Chris and Luis STUDENT said that, yes, it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable
        - And I spoke to STUDENT
        - So he justified his answer
        - So I wouldn't say that you are wrong because it says one are valuable
        - You said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text, so I would asy that your answer is right
        - Um, I think we STUDENT had our reasons and justified our reason
        - I think that was a pretty good and complete answer because she gave the value
        - But I think that Jazmin's answer, And she said,Yeah, because they can drink the water and they can stay hydrated
        - Of the water and how the water could be used
        - you summarize very well okay and about the craters
        - You talked about the craters and craters full of water on the moon
        - Okay, now you elaborate a little bit more in your answer
        - I like that answer
        - Now, okay, I can see that you understand what you were reading
        - And you look back in the text to find your answer and to get STUDENT the information
        - I like how you're thinking about that how you're thinking about what you could use on the moon, even thought it's not in there, that's a very good pull from what you read, STUDENT
        - They are and you're using her deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome
        - And I love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good
        - But I love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good
        - I loved your answer you really use the details in the article you went back and re read so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - So like you said your answer
        - And it looks like you've done that in your answer
        - STUDENT, the water is valuable, but we really need to discuss why
        - Okay, so I can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right STUDENT
        - I see where you found about the microscope, you can see the water
        - But I like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and I really like how you found that, but let's let's see if we can find another tool
        - I really like how you restated the text, but we need to put a little really like that
        - Yeah, so you, you definitely you restated the text
        - And I love how you used I'm like the text to to backup your answer
        - I really like how I mean you went straight to the text and you tell me
        - Yeah, yeah, you're right
        - So try to think about
        - Okay, so next time I really love how you came up with that answer
        - I'm glad that's what we're talking about in the question
        - Good, I'm glad you were looking specifically that they found those the water in the craters
        - You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there
        - And you also found that they both talked about water
        - Now what did the question ask us to find about water
        - You found exactly both of the equipment they talked about, really, really good
        - They did say that it will be a long time because they still haven't been able to access the water,
        - I'm glad that you're looking into the text, instead of just going off of what you know
        - So right after that the paragraph
        - We want to be in, you're exactly right
        - Because it's asking us directly about the text, so yes
        - Okay, so you did find some important information where
        - So, you made a really important
        - Good, I agree that they're not ready
        - No, you're answers great it you caught on to the fact that NASA did send a small machine, but you didn't tell me what this small machine did and I wanted to know
        - They do say that and that's great text evidence to use
        - They say that this especially specifically in the text, but let's look back at our question
        - And I say that you, you basically rephrase the first sentence
        - Yes, that was very good
        - I love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good
        - And that's probably helped you a little bit with reading this passage and being able to connect some of the experiences that you had back to this packet passage
        - And now the reason that you could be confused is because it says it, but we haven't proved it
        - Okay, so we'll keep going
        - Which is which is good because they did use a small machine and it does say small machine,
        - So you you just used a, one sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it
        - Your answer was, NASA sent a small machine
        - So you're in the ballpark
        - So you found the equipment
        - And I like that you use that wording scientific tool
        - I like that you use that word scientific tool
        - Great, great job there,
        - And I really appreciate you explaining your answer
        - I do understand what you mean
        - Well, I do like that you shared your opinion in your answer
        - And sometimes it's hard for us as students and even sometimes as teachers because we're not scientist to understand how long it takes for them to figure out how to get things right
        - Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there
        - I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready
        - So you guys have STUDENT shared your responses with us and that's been really, really good
        - I really liked that you STUDENT tried to pull your evidence from the text
        - Okay, so one of the things I would say is that you STUDENT did a really good job trying to pull things you found Out of the text
        - Yeah, that certainly makes sense from having gone to see that type of stuff
        - That's great that you had a chance to see some other things that have happened in space
        - So that's a great job be able to identify what that means
        - So you STUDENT did a really good job at using your past knowledge on a microscope
        - And so you looked back at the tech stuff on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable
        - Good job so you may be redirected and rethought your answer
        - Yes, it was in the within the text, it does state that this stuff,
        - Okay, well, you know, good job
        - Yes, was within the actual document in this state that you can split up in between oxygen, hydrogen and oxygen
        - STUDENT you were able to sort of, you know, find those key evident that key evidence, very quickly
        - that is very good job
        - Very good for looking deep into your question and in circle in it
        - Alright, so let's first look at the question again
        - And I was very impressed about how STUDENT took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections they really you really thought about the things that we were asking
        - A that is a great response and I love how you made a connection because that helps some of us out a detective
        - Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon
        - You made a connection a detective
        - She used like a STUDENT use that his dad was an astronaut
        - So again, there you goin back in when you said you didn't understand about that word, I think, you know, more than what you think evidence you just showed me evidence about how to survive
        - So I appreciate that you, when looking at the text you notice that the scientists use the microscope
        - So I appreciate that you care To get the correct answer
        - So that's very that's, that's very good to ask so you you are you're seeking to know why your answer was wrong
        - And so I love that y'STUDENT are all thinking about the story and are using
        - Using the text to help support your answers,
        - I do and I think you're doing a good job putting that together
        - That is such a great comment, and it's really great that you're able to tie that in with a real world experience and I would think that they definitely use those things on the moon
        - You can bring in your prior knowledge to the article sort of like STUDENT
        - And I especially like what you said about an opinion because it is asking for an opinion
        - STUDENT, and that was perfect
        - I really, I really think that you did a really good job I identifying and separating the fact that the now versus later
        - So you're, you may know a lot about space, that's, I agree with you
        - You know that answer makes perfect sense
        - You do a great job of talking about the question
        - As far as that goes
        - So you obviously understand the question
        - So again, we're just going to that
        - So you're picking up on key parts of the text which water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important
        - So you already do parts of that you answer the question you provide evidence you explain your evidence
        - You do a great your answers
        - Yes, astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated
        - You can't survive without water
        - And it's hard because I like you to have your own opinion
        - what I would really like you to do, though
        - Yeah, I mean, that's a great way to say it
        - Okay, so we have the first noun what equipment and that's an excellent strategy to look at if our if our question is focused on on noun specific things
        - You did, in fact, your response is very good as finding pieces of text evidence
        - That is that is a great piece of text evidence
        - That was a great thought process, putting those two together
        - Okay so convincing evidence and valuable
        - And that is correct
        - And I like that you found that because you did find a in paragraph four right under that heading so that helped lead you in the right direction
        - And I like the way that you've gone back and put the key words from the question with your answer
        - So I appreciate you looking at your
        - I like how you're making that connection
        - Well, I like how you're bringing in that prior knowledge that you already know to help you answer this question
        - I know exactly where it's at the text as well, I believe, part three of the first pair first section
        - So, good job there Oliveron are deaf
        - Okay, I can see how you got there, I can see I can see that
        - Good job, they're reading into that
        - Yes, that is true
        - I like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and I do agree with you
        - I am very glad that you went back in the texts were able to find support for your answer
        - He did a really good job
        - I really liked your answer and how you can how you included both parts those, the water is heavy and that the water can be broken into two parts, and us
        - That's actually very well done,
        - And that's a very logical series of steps you took to get to that answer
        - I love where you went with that and it was a very logical series of steps that you took,
        - Yeah, that makes complete and total sense
        - That was a good job connecting the dots there
        - It's good that you've pulled in the Lunar Orbiter
        - So you can definitely still say that your answer is, is a big part of what you want to reconstruct to, but I think to be a little more specific
        - And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as STUDENT
        - Your thought process is a lot deeper as well
        - First of STUDENT, because I know that that's a really important detail, but now that we know how it was found in those craters we've answered the question with much more detail
        - Great, that's, that's really good STUDENT
        - So I appreciate that you noticed where the water was found
        - Okay, now, like how you have started thinking about question
        - It did say what equipment do they use discover water on the moon, and you're starting to think about what equipment  Would they need to find water on the moon
        - You have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text Lunar Orbiter and microscope
        - I like how you read the text you saw mentioned microscope and you're thinking, well, I have to have a microscope to see the water deposit
        - Therefore, the microscope is what was used to find as water deposits
        - Right, and I do like how you have focused on part of the question you focused on the part where it says they, they discovered water on the moon and you specifically said where they found water on the moon, they found it in the craters
        - Okay, and I do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen
        - And that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water
        - Absolutely and that's in the text says, Great your point information out of the text that water H2O can be splitting the oxygen and hydrogen
        - Right, well, and I love that you STUDENT were able to close your eyes and see that and help you Oliverelop that
        - So you found that directly in the text
        - Anything you did use a lot of background knowledge and your answer
        - Okay, I understand that
        - but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation
        - And I just like that
        - That was your example
        - Okay, so just like STUDENT I love that you're using your background knowledge to contribute to our discussion and they're also may be
        - um for our first question, you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and I wanted to say that that was really good I like that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists use, but I also want to encourage you to
        - So STUDENT you did a really good job, saying that the microscope was a tool that they used because you're definitely correct it is
        - awesome I want to say that that is a good response because you said that they use a lot of equipment and then you were specific by saying oxygen tanks
        - And I think it's really good when you're reading a text to think about what you already know and experiences you have so like STUDENT is saying
        - he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text
        - Right, I definitely appreciate that um and I like that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer um I do have a concern, though, so the question
        - That is a very good response and I like that you provided a use for the water so that would be your evidence that you pulled from the text um
        - And you were able to find that in the text good job
        - Great job pulling that out of the text
        - So I strength so far from that was, um, you pointed out the material they use, and then you said what it's used for which is very good
        - I like that that's that's a good plan that's what I was thinking when I was reading yesterday first time I was like no not for yeah so I like your response and I like how you look for the evidence
        - For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question
        - Do you think it's a good investment um I thought I thought your answer was great because, like
        - You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said
        - You um I like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't you can't survive without water and
        - um so I like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of
        - Attention to details which is very key in reading passages like this, because if you mess up on details then your answer like could be not what you wanted to say, but like you messed up on reading so then your answer when my county STUDENT messed up if you know what I mean well
        - STUDENT your response is actually really good
        - I like how you use the word microscope and you knew what it was used for
        - That is right, and I like your answer, how you use evidence from what you knew that I told you, in the name of the machine that I set up for
        - Like that it's a lot more general towards what the check said and then an opinion that you add or your guess of what you saw was there
        - I think you did a really great job, pulling from the text,
        - So it was a great response
        - You had some of your personal views, along with some thoughts that came from the text
        - So what you said related to the text really well
        - And STUDENT, I think you had some great vocab sorry, did you have a question, Jazmin
        - yeah it's definitely a good answer to give and you use multiple paragraphs looking through to find that answer, but where the question is kind of
        - i'm glad we could expand on that and we can see how there's much more to getting to space and finding the water than we thought there was
        - But you use great academic knowledge
        - nd great academic vocab in your response
        - So you notice that it was a small machine was very good which they also stated, it shows that you use your context from the text, which is very good
        - But you used great academic vocab in your response
        - They did use a microscope to look at the water closest answer was small I see how you connected those two
        - And the background knowledge is helpful to understand what's going on in the passage, I want you to use that background knowledge to help you understand the passage better and be able to read to find the answers
        - I well, one thing I noticed was that you started out with your context your background knowledge which is great, and always useful
        - Yes, that is right so it's always great to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better or understand the question better
        - Awesome you got that right from the passage,
        - mention a piece of evidence that is in the passage that because it says clearly in the passage um, for example, future astronauts can drink water
        - So you had said that water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen, you are right, that is from passage, so you did get that from the password, which is good,
        - STUDENT, just as you said, you said you understood it, but I still want to give you the feedback
        - awesome so I see what you did,
        - and that was great to use the reading, to help us with our answer
        - awesome so that's what it says in the text, which is great that we used our resources,
        - awesome So yes, that included the important details
        - You don't think it's valuable, so I see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money,
        - let's look at the last sentence, because I like what STUDENT brought up making this plan will take a lot of time and money
        - And STUDENT I also noticed that you have to be did your background knowledge by referencing that they use oxygen tanks on the moon
        - I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon
        - You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right?
        - So I can see why you think that microscope is important, and I agree to the microscope is very important, with discovering water on the moon
        - Okay, so I see how you did connect but you were you were kind of scanning the page for the words that connected to water, because the question was about finding water on the moon
        - That's a really good strategy
        - STUDENT, they did use the microscope to really look closely, and that's a really good way to use the text as evidence in your answer
        - Thank you for pointing that out, STUDENT
        - And thank you STUDENT for explaining your answer and using the text really well
        - answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's
        - You quoted the reading really well and I really like that, and you also found in the text where
        - Um so STUDENT I really liked in your answer that you really, you mentioned the evidence from the from the reading
        - It talks about specific things that the question asks
        - and I really like that you you that you took us to a very specific part in the text um
        - A lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um Farrah and Jazmin you STUDENT really use a lot of Nice language specific language from the texts that I really appreciate
        - So Jazmin's response is really good because it does lead us to answering the question, the question was what equipment did they use
        - And she answers NASA sent a small machine
        - Okay, so Jazmin's response was NASA sent a small machine
        - Yes, thank you, that is
        - is really, really nice way to phrase that
        - that's awesome and I love, how long is like how you worded your answer
        - I love, how you comprehend the reading so well
        - and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one
        - And, your answer is right about the microscope data scientists did use the microscope to look at the water they already found in the reading it says they already found the water
        - I really like how you looks back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did
        - you're totally right about how NASA you so much equipment like oxygen tanks and other things like that, and they definitely do use that when they go to the moon, but
        - Well that's great, and I can definitely tell that you STUDENT read the reading and understood it
        - I totally understand where you're coming from, and I think that's a great way that you STUDENT interpreted interpreted the reading,
        - I definitely can see how you would find it confusing
        - and i'm glad that you STUDENT didn't notice that when you guys read,
        - I do agree that it does say other equipment that Thank you
        - Your answer is almost perfect and it does show that you read the reading and understood it and understood the question which is great
        - They definitely could have, and I do see where you're coming from,
        - Oh, even you bring up a really great point
        - I saw that you use your background information when you
        - Right, so I think that you and Farrah and Oliver STUDENT did this, you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question, which is great
        - Good so Chris and STUDENT you both found specific information for the text so that is great
        - so you got the answer and you use evidence from the text because it says it was a small machine,
        - Right, so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great, but
        - Oh right Okay, so when we read that sentence, that you immediately think okay good we need water to drink, which is a great answer, but what it goes on to say is that
        - And I thought that was great response, I noticed that you used your vocabulary,
        - And you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response
        - Now you you've built on your response
        - So that is a great response
        - i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer, you used the two words scientific tool
        - awesome so i'm noticing, you said you were referred exactly to where in the text you found your answer you said in paragraph three
        - I noticed the it said that they used a microscope to find water, and this is exactly what the question asks I really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer
        - awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read you read that sentence and you strengthen your response
        - The tools, the equipment, she thought about the question and then by looking back in the text you did the same thing you looked in you found another thing that they use the how they discovered this water on the moon so by adding those key terms you're answering the question what equipment
        - awesome so you started with they found these creators of water and then you, you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used
        - Alright, so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you
        - Thank you so much for sharing your responses to me
        - I want to particularly point out, Farrah and Jazmin's responses you STUDENT did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use
        - Naming the exact specific examples of equipment
        - I pointed out, Farrah, and STUDENT, both of you had done a really good job from the beginning
        - Exactly, but you did an awesome job backing up your answer, I really liked that
        - And your background knowledge is very beneficial, and I love how you have that
        - Luis, I know that you were talking about STUDENT your knowledge
        - OK, now, I saw a lot of vocabulary that you STUDENT used in your responses and that's amazing
        - And you did a really good job with that
        - So using the tool that you used, was really good to take equipment and look through the text and examine it, right?
        - So that's what you did
        - You looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted
        - It shows me that you understand what you're reading and you understand the questions i'm asking you, but you had a great start to your question to answer, I mean
        - by NASA I don't think we had any oxygen tank so I love, how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions,
        - See the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes, which is really good
        - We do use that in science STUDENT, but
        - That was actually really good
        - One thing I noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things
        - You connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right,
        - I love how you're challenging your capacities to think about what truly makes water valuable and it really is valuable to get from the moon
        - that's true I do love, how you were challenging the question itself, and I think that we, there is reasons to support our evidence that water is valuable and I don't think that
        - Just not a great connection
        - mm hmm so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article um,
        - You and people use their background knowledge, because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know, but I do you really like that you
        - Right, I really like that, just like STUDENT, I think you have a really good grasp on what you're trying to say, and I think you really understand the text
        - I really like that answer
        - I like that you gave reason to why you think that um
        - um that is like a lot of really good evidence that you shared with me in your answer
        - um which is one concern I have for you, although that is a very good point that it's going to cost a lot of money and it might take a very long time for us to get there
        - That is what I like about your responses, you took that specifically from the text you
        - So you said, water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like STUDENT I really liked this answer because they this is right from the text you took this information, right from the text, and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions
        - Great job! So that's great job using your skills in the text using the context of the text to find your answer
        - I think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text
        - You did use an idea that was stated directly from the text
        - And STUDENT that answer was really great
        - um yeah I so one thing that I noticed from your response, I thought that your response was really well and you wrote it very well and you made the points very clear
        - That, I think your answer is great, and you did do a great job again i'm clarifying you know, saying that
        - That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point
        - And I'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on two things using evidence
        - I really like that you could find that specifically in the types that that tells me that you were reading very carefully, and the fact that you remembered where it came from
        - is very good that means you were paying attention, yes, good job
        - did have evidence and that you said, why it would be a good thing
        - I like that you did state yours like your agreement or disagreement in this case, you would did agree, and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon, and they could drink it so your answer, you had a very good answer
        - I like that was very clarifying
        - I know that they found it and that's really awesome that you picked that up because I think that's a really great piece of information
        - And I like that you really pulled that from the text
        - Great so I love how that you took trying to pick tool and equipment, we use those as cinnamon synonyms and found that answer, that is a great job
        - yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph, and I understand where you would get that answer,
        - I love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about NASA and that they sent a small machine
        - STUDENT, your response was really awesome
        - STUDENT, your answer was really awesome
        - I love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific
        - And you even described what a microscope does, which it allows you to see something super up close, which is what they talk about in the article
        - Great jobs and see you use you knew the important words in the question, and then you looked at me and you saw my sweater is right, so we want to use just the same ideas for that and work with the questions that we answered before
        - yeah I understand I understand your confusion
        - How I phrase, it could have been confusing so next time i'll make sure that I more concisely explain that to you STUDENT
        - STUDENT that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned, which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned, but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon
        - STUDENT it's a really great job I really love you guys are starting to use the text that you read previously
        - And that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article
        - So that's great that you were able to point that out
        - It's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article
        - So a microscope is a type of equipment
        - That's a very good thing to point out
        - There's more than just those pieces of equipment that scientists have to use and the astronauts have to use to get to the moon
        - you're right that is a scientific tool that we use during science to see things closely
        - So that would make sense
        - And some of your science classes, maybe
        - So if you use one before
        - Right, so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer, which is great
        - So they did use a microscope and night you found that right from the evidence
        - So I like how in your answer
        - STUDENT, you were specific and you said that they found the water in the Craters of the moon
        - Right, and that's a great answer, because I see you got your information right from the article inch paragraph for that water is heavy
        - And it takes up a lot of space
        - You have put the steps together very well in your brain
        - They need things to even be in space
        - That is very, very, very good
        - STUDENT and I, what I like about that is if I didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon, and I had never read this passage I could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer
        - I like that you expanded your thinking
        - STUDENT, what I really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts, your own thought of maybe If they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well
        - And I see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good
        - I really liked that you had an answer to what your opinion was of whether or not you think there's compelling evidence
        - That there isn't much water on the moon
        - STUDENT, I love how you have said things that you've learned from the text is party to support your answer
        - Right okay good, so I, like STUDENT of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text and use your best work to get to where you are
        - So I can see where you would say microscope oh go ahead
        - That was wonderful thinking
        - I loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better
        - And I wanted to say, STUDENT
        - I loved in your first answer that you agreed with STUDENT, because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking
        - And that's really important and learning
        - I like your second answer better because you put it in your own words
        - And thank you so much for using that sentence starter
        - That is a great answer
        - So both of you found your answers somewhere in the text, you were, it was clear that you read the text and I really love that you were looking at the text, you definitely read it, or at least looked at it, which is great
        - Okay, Deb, I just want to say I really love that you listened to STUDENT and listening is such an important skill as a student
        - Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her
        - That's a really great skill
        - And even I value STUDENT that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing
        - I love that you've used your listening skill and you listen to Farrahs answer
        - STUDENT That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text
        - Thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said, it seems like you're asking, How come you didn't get full credit for your answer
        - I like that you gave a specific tool
        - It's great to read our answers directly in the text
        - I like how you took your answer correctly from the text
        - So you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly
        - Which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text
        - How you even expanded your thinking just now
        - Yeah, I really appreciate appreciate that you were looking carefully at the question and exactly the words is equipment
        - Yeah, I really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question
        - You really gave us the evidence you found in a text, the importance of water
        - I really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question
        - Okay, I really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for STUDENT the passage when you answer the question
        - Yeah, I like it
        - You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer
        - so I could see you, how you got confused there
        - Right, so I could see where that would get confusing
        - Right, I saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text, which is great
        - It gives us almost like a little step ahead
        - But again, that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better
        - It helps us understand text a lot more when we have that
        - And I love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great
        - So you have text evidence from the text
        - I like that you use the background information, though, STUDENT, it's always great to have that helps us understand and text a little more
        - I love that you used, you told me, which paragraph you found that evidence, right, the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is
        - I love that you went and use a specific example from the text, right, that was
        - No need to feel bad
        - Okay, I appreciate your honesty, I also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text
        - So I see that you said they were looking for Ice deposits right in the poet large polar crater
        - I see that you read the text and you were looking for A different machine different types of machines and tools they use
        - I see how you got that answer
        - I can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine
        - So I can tell that you did the reading and you're really excited to read about the water on the moon,
        - Okay, I see, I see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see
        - So you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what science scientists would need if they were on the moon
        - Looking back at the text and adding more detail
        - But I like that now you're thinking about how your you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking
        - Good work, paying close attention to the details of our story
        - I think definitely you could I think just paying close attention to those small details is really important
        - Yeah, I like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew
        - Yeah, I see that you're really getting this idea that there wasn't a lot of ice on the moon
        - I'm really glad that you that this STUDENT was able to make some real world connections, based on your past experiences
        - That's a really good skill to be able to have
        - I see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters, but there was only a little bit of water
        - So that's what's called like texts to real world connections
        - Where we found that from is from outside now
        - So that's a really good skill to have
        - Yeah, I see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great
        - So I can definitely see where STUDENT got his answer because like you said the paragraph says that this that the walk
        - The ice is found in the crater
        - so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that
        - I like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information
        - And I really like that you brought up that point
        - I like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us
        - Now let's see some other answers STUDENT
        - I really liked that you noticed that NASA had sent a small machine
        - So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, STUDENT
        - And I love how you pull that answer for number two
        - And I love how just like STUDENT You're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important
        - And I love that answer, because I can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it
        - I love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool
        - Thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer
        - Thank you for that STUDENT
        - So you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding
        - That was that's a much more specific detailed answer
        - They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did
        - and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer
        - yeah I like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this with this stuff
        - awesome I love how confident you are in your answer and I love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space
        - awesome great and I love how you're STUDENT looking back at the text
        - Use the technique core like locating the keywords and to find help you find the answer, but my
        - Locating this into the second paragraph
        - And I'm glad that you are you are ready to read the text that that tells me that you read the text and that you understand the meaning of these facts
        - Okay, so, um, I know that sometimes can be difficult to remember scientific words
        - Answer is not wrong
        - Okay, that's great evidence to support it
        - You STUDENT brought your background knowledge to answer this question and I'm happy that you are able to do that
        - That's a really good point
        - Yeah, so I see both of your points
        - So I like that answer
        - but that's a good answer, because it does refers to something back in the text
        - I love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive
        - And what it did was it three great things
        - He told us what equipment they use and what it was called
        - I love your answer
        - And you use that to make a complete answer
        - And so, so while you're here
        - So I like that you found some details in the article
        - Let me talk to you and STUDENT
        - um yeah Okay, I see what you're saying
        - awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me STUDENT
        - That told us how they were able to discover it, so I had the same question when I was reading it right, I was thinking, how did they find it they can't even see it
        - um that's that's good thinking that you that you did not notice that
        - yeah it does seem like that would be really important
        - hmm I definitely understood that um you were looking for different
        - Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details
        - that's great STUDENT and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about on how you were answering that question, and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic
        - And STUDENT you have your hand raised before
        - Okay yep and that's that's a valid argument there, but you know, I think
        - Yes, so STUDENT I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of
        - I really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water, but I was wondering STUDENT
        - And you know what's the banner that could be a little bit confusing
        - And that's a really great question that's what I bought to STUDENT, but when I read about the
        - yeah but I like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests, you and I really liked it that's where your
        - Okay, so I hear that you found some specific items from the text
        - yeah so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water, you need a special instrument in order to find it but
        - Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from
        - So just using that one sentence STUDENT and i'm really like i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - You also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so like I love, how you really use the key vocabulary, to help you find your answer so really great job,
        - yeah it seems like you have a ton of background knowledge about what equipment that astronauts use, could you tell me specifically because we learned something really cool about water on the moon
        - but I love, how you both had different opinions and said your evidence, and went there, yes STUDENT
        - Perfect so I love, how you identified that like NASA sends a small machine and I think you're on the right track,
        - Right, and I think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists, we would need a microscope in order to see that water right
        - that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right is
        - I like you added STUDENT that in there and accessed your background knowledge um
        - mm hmm so the miscroscope is the equipment that we might have had more experience with
        - You might have seen it or heard of it, so I can see why you would have picked it out from the passage
        - But yeah they had to really, really dig deep to find any particles that they can even look at it, so I love it you like expanded that an understatement That was good
        - But let's look at it again, it said, the water we found was microscopic
        - Where you got that answer so she did a really good job of using the text
        - awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use
        - scientists definitely use microscopes
        - That was a good connection
        - Okay STUDENT I see you located a specific piece of the text, that was a good a good move,
        - Okay, very good, and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some US so one could think of it as an equipment, so I completely understand why you may have been confused and if
        - makes sense, I completely understand why you could think that
        - lovely and that that makes complete sense, of course, like if we send people to the moon, how will they be able to do that
        - and you guys are already provide the evidence you guys already circle, the evidence and the text that we can use for the answer the questions so STUDENT why don't I just start off with you
        - Oh, I see, so you are making a prediction there right and you're making connections that is excellent job STUDENT However, my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that I gave you so
        - yeah and you found the text evidence as well, you did an excellent job, STUDENT right, you did you did either disappear job excellent
        - awesome well, I really enjoyed your response STUDENT because it really displays the most outstanding aspect of background knowledge and
        - I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there
        - So I love, how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading I could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me STUDENT that are really, really great job
        - OK, I see that the best part about your best part about your work, is that you understood the text passage correctly
        - awesome great job and telling me but small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job and showing me how you understood the text okay excellent STUDENT go right ahead
        - yeah I love how you're telling us about the process find any so locate in the US, or perhaps and
        - I love how utilizing STUDENT the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed
        - That appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing, but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good
        - that's awesome he said I love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the STUDENT and really, really appreciate it, and then you also show me how outstanding aspect of background knowledge that you have an insight as class
        - Sure okay I love that you gave the answer, and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word Microsoft scoping from the passage some important key word there,
        - I really liked that you're sharing your process with us yeah go ahead
        - yeah you're right right right right okay I love that you're sharing STUDENT this thoughts great
        - yeah so I love that you're sharing that with us and the water being discovered that is called the microscopic okay
        - yeah oh good good I love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great great I love it STUDENT right Oliverin, I would like to circle back oh yeah go ahead
        - that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there STUDENT that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it
        - It's always a great idea
        - Oh great, I love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure
        - got it thanks guys, so it tells me that you STUDENT really spend some good time examining this article, and looking for answers to this question about the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - That would be easy for you to sign and come back to
        - I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text
        - That your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right, thank you for noticing that on your own
        - so STUDENT used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is
        - that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point
        - I love love love that you brought up that example that's that's what's called an analogy, and it is a great analogy STUDENT
        - I see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool and the text
        - It is, I see how you mean that connection
        - Oh well, that's Okay, I see how you got to your answer by talking about what they discovered which was another important part
        - yeah I see I see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space if they can't go by any
        - but I see how you came to your conclusion
        - I think i'm I see how you got to your answer
        - yeah I see I see how you got to your answer so i'm assuming that the answer you gave me was just no, but the question asks for you to provide some evidence, so I suggest
        - Oh that's really interesting I have not, I have not read that but I see how you could use that maybe as evidence to support your your answer that maybe, yes it is valuable
        - Yes, I see how you found found you got to that
        - Oh Okay, so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting
        - Oh, so you have made a connection between deep and pools, and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting
        - now let's take deeper STUDENT I really value, how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon
        - Okay, thank you, that was very gracious of you STUDENT and Dave to have this discussion and to clarify this concern
        - Oh OK, so I really value, how you have talked you have thought about STUDENT the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration, which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration
        - Okay, so thank you so much for sharing your responses, I really value how both of you did until I know you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest
        - Okay Thank you so much for sharing your response STUDENT I really value, how you have stated, the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end
        - Right, well, I could totally see why you would think that, STUDENT, right because you were looking for equipment, something that's going to help us look at water
        - Clearer a little bit sharper in terms of understanding what that small machine is because
        - And you talked about equipment, I think a microscope is certainly an equipment,
        - Oh yeah that's a good idea
        - I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um
        - yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text,
        - And if not, which component is missing missing I think even did a really good job of identifying which component was missing from his
        - And STUDENT I was curious with your response
        - I thank you first for Providing that response and I love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope
        - yeah so a lot of times, and I love that you're bringing in science STUDENT i'm sure you guys have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class
        - Okay, so even I like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used
        - Ah, I see what you're saying interesting I see your perspective in and you're thinking about what scientists might need as part of the equipment that they need to go searching for the water on the moon
        - Okay, so I like the way that you went back to the passage and he looked more closely to see if you could find more information, so there was nothing wrong with your answer before, in that it gave us a hint but
        - And you know, sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing
        - i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills STUDENT so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay
        - yeah I love Thank you that's I love the way that you stated that it showed a new thinking STUDENT yes
        - I think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear, and it may painted such a clear picture for others, so thank you for restating that
        - Yes, STUDENT I saw from your response that you really use your background knowledge well and you did a great job using that background knowledge
        - awesome so I saw in your answer STUDENT that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon
        - Oh that's true that's true, but what I see you doing STUDENT is pulling out your background knowledge which is really strong you're doing a great job pulling out that background knowledge
        - I love that critical thinking Farrah I love, looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a team has Oliver and Farrah let's as a team go back to the text and i'd like you to, yes STUDENT
        - That is so true and I love that you brought in that background information STUDENT that's super important when you're reading a text like this, so great job
        - Hello everyone, I just want to say thank you so much for sharing your answers with me, I can tell by everything that you guys put down that you really understood this passage and done a great job looking in the text, for your answers STUDENT
        - that's a great point STUDENT, which is why answering these questions can be kind of tricky
        - But I think we STUDENT did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question, so if we want to answer another question
        - Okay, so you identified a piece of equipment right and I like that you started off with that,
        - I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense
        - Oh really great point STUDENT Farrah with yours on specifically I noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does
        - And then for Chris and STUDENT I noticed that you two have really great you know you either side, you have the first part, the second part that's great now we need to work on adding in that missing part
        - Right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question
        - ooh I like that you're looking for that keyword right
        - ooh really great detail with your Farrah I loved how you did STUDENT those three steps right, you told me here's a piece of equipment, this is what it does now question to you, does
        - it's in the text right you're exactly right STUDENT great job connecting directly from the text, so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i'm
        - Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because
        - Okay, so yeah you give a specific answer that included the name of the equipment that's really concrete
        - I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer
        - that's a great point STUDENT
        - Okay, great I appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence, just like Luis was picking out that evidence and so was Farrah Oliver and STUDENT so
        - Great I love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question, there
        - yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used
        - Yeah these are such good guesses right, and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is
        - because sometimes readers, even if they don't have STUDENT the details, they make a picture in their head and they might update that picture as they keep reading, but they start to form an idea in their head in a picture of what that would look like
        - Okay, I see what you're thinking there
        - Okay, I love that you STUDENT brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses
        - Okay, so I think that you STUDENT did a really great job of Combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right Luis and Jazmin you guys talked about the small machine called the Lunar orbiter
        - Yes, that's awesome and I see you found some great evidence in the text because they do say that, precisely, thank you for sharing
        - STUDENT I I love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with
        - You also I see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article, which is great
        - Yes, definitely I see how you're connecting original answer and growing your
        - So you use the text to inform your answer, which is great so i'm
        - that's how you feel a great so let's just let's just do like a little thought experiment so even though you don't like writing and maybe that's why you're not being so specific which I can understand
        - That sounds like a really good strategy and will probably set you up for success next time we're coming up with a problem
        - I like that you found relationship between the words
        - It allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if I don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine, so thank you for that Thank you
        - I think that you you STUDENT circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that NASA uses to find water on space
        - Okay, I think that's a great strategy that you're using so yeah, so I think that is an important part of the question, what blah blah blah like does that or what equipment and then what are we looking for with the equipment
        - Nice, I, like the way that you're using the strategy to kind of pull apart the important parts of the question
        - yeah so thank you yeah so I like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water um and great
        - Nice yeah so thank you so you're right, it is equipment, which is what we're looking for and you found it in the third paragraph I like I use the text
        - yeah so I definitely like the way that you're going about this about answering this question is you're thinking about equipment and they're thinking about equipment us to discover or find or look for the water
        - yeah so I also see the Lunar orbiter in paragraph two
        - yeah I like how your second half, got a little bit more specific after our conversation
        - yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools, so that was a great revision
        - Oh, I really like that strategy of looking for keywords I think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy
        - Okay, well, I think that it's great that you guys have been looking for keywords when I was speaking with STUDENT, he also He also mentioned the same thing, and I think that that's a really great strategy
        - and I really value how, in your answer you STUDENT directly talked about a piece of equipment
        - I agree yeah oxygen tanks, is an important piece of equipment for astronauts so I really like that you included that in your response
        - Yes, well, I really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer because
        - STUDENT right, I appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words
        - Great well, I really appreciate how you STUDENT chose to look for a piece of equipment
        - awesome, and so what I really like about what you said STUDENT is this word machine that you mentioned,
        - Great yeah and STUDENT when I read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope, and so I think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned
        - Yeah great, so I think STUDENT I liked in your original answer, how you mentioned a small machine
        - STUDENT you said something interesting you said not yet, and I really like that, because it makes me think that maybe there's more to the story, maybe something might happen, where it might be valuable
        - The scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's very good that you STUDENT use textual evidence in the text um, but how do you think
        - Oh that's what you were thinking okay cool um
        - um I really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation
        - um you STUDENT located the information in the text very, very well um
        - I think you were, you definitely used some great skills on figuring out okay which in which sentence, did they find water right?
        - And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope
        - Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way
        - that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading
        - mm hmm no That was really good using her background knowledge, because it didn't say it in the text, so it was very good
        - That was actually good using background knowledge to make connections
        - Using the context clues that we use before, when we were analyzing the question you know, using words like investigate and seeing that it's a small machine that they use it's a great job
        - Good alright so that's good background knowledge understanding what they found
        - so that's actually a good context to as well, using that background knowledge understanding our tools
        - yeah and I see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used
        - Both had this inclusion about the microscope right this detail about the microscope, and so I see how you're providing this specific tool to support your answer
        - Great and then STUDENT you've included some great pass knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts, hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense, with why we need water, we need these perks
        - So I see how that connects to what we're talking about here
        - And I see how your even mentioning other answers like Jazmin's she mentioned it's needed to be
        - Okay, so I see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right, and one piece of equipment is a microscope
        - So I see that you got your answer from the first paragraph
- intent: 400
  examples: |
        - Your answer isn't it wrong that they use the microscope to look at the water, but in the text that we just read It describes a piece of machinery that the scientists use to locate that water on the moon
        - Can you and STUDENT work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool?
        - Well, so I think that first you use, you can start with one right and then focus on really building that answer out Ray so identifying the the scientific the scientific equipment And then being able to explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon, and then, once you've gotten that you can add on to your answer
        - and we're going to keep our eyes open
        - Well let's think about it, how can we make that even more specific STUDENT because you're absolutely right, they did send a small machine, how can we were in the text, can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine
        - Excellent, so I would say, if you added that to your answer that would make it Nice and specific
        - yeah you you so maybe I think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure, because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope Go ahead
        - I am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so, can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text STUDENT
        - so, can you look at the text STUDENT and see what the machine does
        - you mentioned the small machine, but a better answer would tell me what the machine does
        - awesome so Chris, I want you to go back to the text, and I want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay okay okay awesome okay STUDENT i'm ready for you
        - awesome well STUDENT I have a job for you, I want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay Luis
        - At least here in this case so STUDENT and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment
        - So when we talk about what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon, I want you to kind of circle, a word or two anybody circle two words or did you guys STUDENT circle one word
        - Well i'm I wouldn't necessarily say that your answer is wrong, but I think that maybe there's a more specific answer to what it could be
        - So for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon, maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment, because well the Lunar orbiter is a small machine it's also it's a lunar orbiter is a more specific example STUDENT yeah
        - who remembers when Oliver asked what equipment was and Oliver said that it's like a tool right, so you can look for kind of key words like that STUDENT do you have a  question
        - Absolutely, and you are, you are, you are correct and, but when we're asking you in this question is to circle, the evidence, so we want you to draw your answer from something specifically that you read here
        - STUDENT was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use
        - But if we're reading this article, we want to draw specific examples coming from that
        - But if i'm asking you a question, where i'm asking like what equipment did scientists use and then i'm telling you this circle your answer on that your answer needs to come from what you just read
        - But we're really focused on trying to find evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        - so can someone try to find a part in the text where they see which equipment scientists use to discover the water
        - but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right
        - so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words
        - so Farrah and STUDENT both circled microscope
        - that is a half the answer um but you would also look for something that helped them, you know sort of get to the water and like how they were able to look closely
        - STUDENT, you have a question
        - Absolutely and that's something that like STUDENT put into his answer right and like those are correct, but we're looking at what this question is asking us
        - All right STUDENT I want you right now to look at this question, and I want you to underline in this question, what you think the most important word or the key word is in this question
        - Do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it
        - I want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and I want you to find the most important word or the key word that you think is most important in this question
        - In the question what which which which most important word
        - Did you pick out in the question
        - A microscope is equipment
        - Yes, but I want us to look in our question and I want us to find an action word because, so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water, but we haven't underlined our action word
        - So right now, STUDENT to find action word and underline
        - You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely
        - So STUDENT with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great
        - But when you tell me about the tool
        - What are we trying to do to the water, STUDENT
        - So I want STUDENT to look in your text at paragraph two, yes
        - Okay STUDENT, so we just identified that we are looking for the equipment that was used to specifically discover water
        - That is a synonym for investigate
        - So now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question
        - Find would be the same
        - But let's look back
        - It's discovering so let's keep reading to see if it tells us what they're trying to discover because so far, we have a piece of equipment that's trying to discover something
        - So right now we have a piece of equipment that is discovering water
        - So right now I want you to think about what might be a better answer to our question because now we found a piece of equipment that's looking to discover water
        - So take a second and write a new answer yes, STUDENT
        - So when we're answering questions we need to make sure we're answering the question that's being asked
        - Okay, you need to be more specific in your answer
        - What small machine? What was it called?
        - Also, STUDENT, your question or your answer
        - Had to do with equipment as well
        - But you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the main
        - You could have been looking at her paper
        - Yes, Oliver, um but yes, instead of your answer being as circled the same as STUDENT, you could have said that, instead of just saying I circled the same as her
        - So you're, you're pretty much right you could of went a little more into detail
        - But they, It was a small machine
        - It was the Lunar Orbiter
        - But that's not what the, um, that's not what
        - The question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon? It said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon
        - Look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see
        - Okay, let's go ahead and talk about that
        - If you look at what it should be
        - You said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah, you would need a microscope to look really closely closely, but does
        - okay and in your answer
        - Does your answer tell what discovered the water?
        - Look in paragraph two, of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread, paragraph two of the passage
        - But my concern is, is that your answer doesn't really address the question that was given to you
        - Can you be more specific look back and paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer
        - Can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer
        - What's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer
        - but it's not quite the only thing that they used
        - We just need to go and find a little bit more evidence
        - So can we go ahead and look back at the question and I want you to circle or underline two key words that you think are important in the question
        - So there are two key words that I want us to look for when we're looking at the question
        - so some of your answers did involve equipment, but it also needed to involve the word discover
        - And remember your two key words equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the word discover and equipment
        - There are a piece of equipment that they used
        - And, but if you look back in our paragraph like our set our reading passage, there's going to be one specific tool
        - So scientists do use those type of things
        - So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer
        - So again, let's look back at our question and look for two key words that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage
        - Go ahead and look for two words in the past or in the question
        - So now that we know the two key words that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable
        - Can STUDENT look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be
        - So, STUDENT I want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four, where we see the word valuable okay because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable
        - Can you do that
        - so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable
        - So I know where your answer came from
        - Deb, I know you said that you had the same answer as STUDENT, but if you could find that in the text and circle it
        - I'm looking for the specific name and it starts with the letter M, if that's helpful
        - You can look back in your reading for that
        - I would love if you could tell me a little bit more about what that machine is
        - And STUDENT NASA send out a small machine
        - I just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me
        - Did you did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name? So instead of just saying a small machine
        - Did you find that in the text?
        - They called it a microscope
        - That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now
        - Looking into and finding it for the first time
        - So look at your answer and look at the question and see if your answer actually answered the question that was a lot of those a lot of words that were the same, but you have your answer actually is answering the question while you're looking, I'm going to hop over to STUDENT
        - Your answers not wrong, but I want you to be more specific
        - So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer
        - I asked STUDENT over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text
        - Can you look for that for me
        - Well, they used a lunar orbiter
        - But we need to figure out what in the world that is so keep reading and see if you can find that one word That I'm looking for
        - It's answering a different question
        - But it's not answering that specific question that was being asked of us
        - So even though your answer is true
        - Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific
        - And that is very, very true, but it's not exactly phrased in the way that answers the question
        - Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question
        - Thinking back on what I just told STUDENT, does it answer the question that we are asking
        - Can you go back in the text and look for specific equipment that they use
        - Well, just because you need to have a deeper understanding doesn't mean your answers wrong just that you could probably put in a little more detail in your answer
        - I want you STUDENT to look at question number one
        - OK, so what I want us to do is just a minute
        - I want you STUDENT to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth
        - but I want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two key words that are important, that might help you answer the question
        - And that's a it's an equipment, isn't it, but we look in the passage for a specific small machine and it tells us in the passage that there is a it gives us the name of the small machine
        - But it's not the specific machine
        - And STUDENT That you put scientists found is using a small machine so that small machine is correct that small machine could be any sort of tool
        - So a little more in depth
        - They did send a small machine, right, that is, but it was asking specifically
        - So could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment
        - What that piece of equipment's name was?
        - You just needed to go just a little bit more in depth
        - But I think you may be confused on the question,
        - and maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water
        - And the question I think we need to be a little more specific
        - So all those facts are right that you STUDENT had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay
        - And they did have lots of equipment right that's what she put on there, but I think you may still be a little confused about what the questions asking
        - So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called?
        - Um, how can I say maybe you can read again the paragraph to really understand what is this small machine that they use
        - So I think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you Oliver, I noticed that your response says that it's kind of more in relation to STUDENT, as opposed to telling me anything about what went on in that text and
        - So why don't we kind of read and rephrase this a little bit,
        - So you say a small machine, what specific small machine do you think you were talking about there?
        - So your answer could be improved with a little bit of clarity
        - If we were more, a little more specific, I should say
        - But if I was only reading the answers to this specific question, I might not have the context and know that So by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about
        - So right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct
        - But for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding
        - So we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically
        - And it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at
        - but it's still wrong
        - We want to know about this equipment
        - So if we were able to come to that same sort of answer, but give more details, you might be able to better inform your reader, who's me the teacher
        - You want to make sure I'm in for sure
        - Then I'm kind of in the dark
        - The what we're looking for is a bit wider of an understanding what you said is factually true right with the microscope you do use that to look but
        - If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space
        - Yes, yes, they do
        - But I think that answered might leave out some important parts of the story
        - So we got to make sure that when we're answering
        - We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were
        - Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there
        - Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water
        - I think the article talks about being able to find water and
        - Okay, okay, well, we may need to take another look back there
        - So if we're able to kind of rephrase our answer
        - I think you've got a, you know, an interesting perspective there
        - But it may be a smaller amount
        - So that's one of the great things that we can do, since we're in a class in a learning environment, we can use our skills to reread some articles and we can look back and we can try to find these details if you give me one moment STUDENT yes def
        - Could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that NASA used in this article to help discover water on the moon
        - I think we can be a little more specific in your response
        - Um, they're, they're gonna use oxygen tanks there
        - So you said like oxygen tanks and yeah, absolutely
        - And that is really close to what we're looking for here
        - So the difference are kind of the difference maker here instead of a small machine that could mean a lot of things do you think a microscope counts as a small machine
        - Yes, so NASA did send a small machine
        - Um, I think we can look and a lot of us has focused on one piece of equipment
        - I think that we could even
        - So this is kind of for STUDENT of us here
        - Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters
        - In this case, STUDENT was a little too vague
        - Something that's right on the cusp of being just what I'm looking for
        - I think he would be on a great, great track
        - And STUDENT might have been a little too specific, if you can come in the middle of there
        - If you can include multiple pieces of equipment and kind of fully answer that question
        - Help to discover a water on the moon, right, because that's how it ends
        - And we're very specific when we're writing
        - That way you don't get any confusion, so they know you're just as smart as I know you are
        - A lot of words can seem tough, but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way
        - And I think we can kind of change how that sets up
        - This is how you go about doing it
        - We're talking about NASA specifically right
        - We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon
        - We're talking about someone that's already done
        - So instead of starting with something that says you you would need this to do that
        - You can use this to do that
        - Here, why don't we change that to be NASA, how would we rearrange that sentence if we were talking about NASA specifically well
        - Why don't we change the subject
        - So you could say, NASA
        - I think would convey your meeting
        - Right, we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically
        - Or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those
        - Now that's true, you do use a microscope to look really close, but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water
        - We can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water
        - So maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close
        - Okay, so once you go back and circle the evidence in the text that can you can use to answer the question
        - Once you try it
        - So remember, that's what we're trying to get the information Pro is what ring
        - So if you read the text and you read the question What words are kind of synonyms for each other
        - So maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific, you said NASA send a small machine
        - Well, that'd be a good strategy
        - So, but you could clarify your statement, a little bit more
        - What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is
        - Remember this your posts to look at the question and see what specific information is looking for
        - Once you reread that question
        - So, but let's look at the question again
        - But the question is actually specifically pointing toward
        - And again, like he said you know that's one way to look at it
        - So you get that information
        - As you're reading the test
        - You're the question is trying to answer so SCAM, IT LOOK AT THE QUESTION
        - And then read to answer the question
        - STUDENT when we are asked to answer a question
        - The first thing is to always find evidence in the text
        - It's very important that we go back in the text
        - And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that
        - So what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Now I want you to start using a scale after you circle your evidence, I want you to go back and think deeper about the question
        - What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word
        - But when we are answering a question and we when we are prompted to use evidence from the text, our answer must be specific
        - Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a
        - So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine
        - I need to dig a little deeper
        - And what else does the passage
        - However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like STUDENT learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right
        - And be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text STUDENT
        - Keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer
        - Okay, STUDENT, I would like you to go back when you get a chance, and look back over the passage, and I would like for you to underline where the scientists and what they're using, um, to help them find the water and
        - Can someone see what they brought
        - Why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two, to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate
        - Okay, so that is true
        - That is something that we read in the story, but does it answer the questions about what they used
        - That's true, but we want to focus on the text
        - I'm STUDENT, you wrote that NASA send a small machine
        - So maybe we need to investigate look a little further, to see what is that machine called
        - I think we just need some more to it
        - Okay, so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text
        - So one strategy we could use let's let's work together with STUDENT
        - Let's help her her figure out what we could add to this
        - But we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable
        - Wow, that's very possible and STUDENT, you did find some good information because water can be very heavy
        - Why, why when you split those the reasons that they're valuable
        - What I want you to do is to you've got a really great start on your answer, but I also want you to describe what oxygen, hydrogen
        - Does that make sense
        - And can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence
        - Good, so you're right, it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen
        - Now let's go a little bit further with that answer
        - Let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon
        - So instead of oxygen tanks
        - Could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment
        - Let's take a look at Section three and see if you can find it
        - So, um, the sections are labeled 12345 and six
        - See ifyou can find equipment that helped scientist, the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water
        - That's a key word in the question is equipment
        - This time, can you also look and see if you can find the equipment
        - Does that make sense?
        - Okay, so you are right NASA did send a small machine, but instead of looking for the machine
        - So if you look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question
        - Can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon
        - Okay, can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment
        - The same thing applies for yours
        - Okay, so they did that is true, they did find water on the moon, but now
        - So they do use a lot of things, but I was just wanting STUDENT to look for these specific equipment that the scientists use to discover the water
        - But I was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so I mean you do have a point there that they used other things too
        - Right, so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope
        - So your answer was right on it to you just wanted to add some more detail to it
        - But looking more specifically, you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does
        - So when I'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable
        - But we want to say give like an a yes or no question
        - If you think that it is valuable and STUDENT of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving
        - They can use it for rocket fuel, it can be split apart
        - So you want to say yes it's valuable because of STUDENT the things that you were saying
        - You guys are STUDENT close but you want to get an exact answer
        - So you want to expand your answer a little bit
        - Maybe, but you can also use the passage
        - Remember to so you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable
        - So you were close also, but there that small machine had a name, and we need to find that exact name in the passage
        - It was a small machine, STUDENT
        - but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water
        - And you using context clues to find that exact name for that equipment
        - But they also had to use the more specific tool to look at the water itself
        - So yeah, you guys STUDENT had similar good answers, but you wanted to dig a little deeper to find the exact answer
        - but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine
        - Yeah, the reading and the question
        - You're, you know what, you're not wrong, but I'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon
        - Because to me, they knew the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space
        - I don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water
        - I don't think the intention is for it to discover water
        - The point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts
        - It's just a little bit incomplete
        - So I don't know How it was really marked wrong because I think to me
        - It was lacking a just I'll just a small detail on what specific machine they sent
        - So I would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete
        - Because some of us are, you know, technically correct, but not not super correct like STUDENT over there said oxygen tanks
        - Now that is equipment and it did help them, you know, get to The moon to discover the water, but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water
        - We just need that extra bit of  I guess what specific machine
        - And your answer said they sent a small machine which is true
        - It's a little bit more detailed than Luis's
        - And could you discover water with that specific tool
        - Could you go into space
        - I think that they're wanting a specific like like I think they're trying to get the very specific tool like if they handed you a tool right now
        - So my suggestion to STUDENT of you would be to maybe
        - Svannah and STUDENT the microscope helps them look closer at the water, but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water
        - Is that I would read the questions first
        - Then I'd read the passage
        - So my suggestion when you are reading a prompt and answering questions
        - You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words
        - And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again
        - So, STUDENT right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read
        - So go back to STUDENT the circle answers that you pick and pick which one you think best answers the question,
        - This help discover water on the moon
        - I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we STUDENT could have answered the question better and more specific
        - I like that you said no because it's going to take a lot you know of time and money
        - The question was, is water valueable
        - But the question you answered was do you think you would be a good investment
        - But I do think water is valuable
        - So I would agree with you say that's not a good investment
        - but he could have been a little bit more specific to the question he was answering
        - I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we STUDENT had
        - Because he answered, whether it was a good investment
        - Now he could have extended his answer a little bit more
        - He said it could be useful because it can be broken down
        - Yeah, and that's what STUDENT said
        - And said what is valuable about breaking it down
        - That's the only thing I would have done
        - I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down
        - And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down
        - So that's the only thing I would add to your answer
        - and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used
        - Okay, so next time we need to read it again
        - Okay? So we understand clearly what are the tools that they are using and the equipment
        - So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your
        - Friends, I would like to know that you are understanding what you're reading and write it down with your own words
        - Okay, so do you see why it's important to make sure to read STUDENT of the information before we try to answer the question
        - What was that small machine called? I want you to turn to somebody next to you
        - Let's look, so NASA sent a small machine
        - So although you're, you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely, what it equip-- They're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it
        - But did they discover the water with the microscope?
        - So they use the microscope, microscope isn't equipment that they looked at really closely with the water
        - I want you to underline two things and raise your hand
        - And if you want to amaze me
        - I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back
        - I want STUDENT to do that for me
        - Alright, so let's draw our attention back to that
        - But you focus on the article
        - So when we find evidence, what do we have to do with that evidence
        - Alright, start thinking about detectives
        - So we have to be detectives
        - There's an "I" word in the article, you find it?
        - But, and so when we have evidence
        - But you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon
        - Well, so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that
        - So it's really important when we are answering questions, even though you found part of the question stem and your answer
        - You've got to look around it to make sure that's the total
        - They would have to use a combination of STUDENT those things
        - But this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use
        - And what we can do with the water once they found it
        - So your answer is almost there
        - So NASA send a small machine
        - It was a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - You just need to add a little bit more information to it
        - So yes, it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question, because we have to also ask a small machine that did what? okay
        - But sometimes we have to look around too
        - Yeah, sometimes that works
        - They're both true, it doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable
        - So do we have evidence there of what could be used what it could be used for because that's, I think that's what you're struggling with STUDENT, is that you want it to be right now and not look for it
        - Because whenever we have an explanation or whatever we have evidence from article
        - So say we have one sentence of evidence we have to have two sentences of our explanation
        - So we have to describe that
        - But did you name the machine? Did you give specific details?
        - So we have to name it
        - So we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers
        - And let's think about what key words
        - Do you hear when you are reading that question
        - So think about that on your own real quick and then we will discuss what keywords, we see
        - So let's think about that question together real quick
        - Can anybody find that for me? Where it says a machine or tool? Can anyone find that in the text for me? STUDENT?
        - It could be a machine
        - It can be, words like machine or a tool
        - Okay, so let's look at this keyword equipment and find me in the text where it talks about a type of equipment
        - So when we look at our key words and then our key words there in the passage
        - We know that it's got to be more than just that
        - Right, we would think that, but when we look at our key words from the text we got to remember, it's telling us the answers in the text
        - And we got to look for the specific answer
        - Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with
        - It lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer
        - lets people know what you're talking about
        - Because if you just put Lunar Orbiter
        - We're not going to which question
        - We need to restate that question in our answers
        - Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question
        - Oh, you're right, they do do a lot of equipment
        - So that's one reason that we need to be very specific in our answer isn't it
        - Master breathe with and they use different equipment for different task, but we needed to know specifically what they used to discover the Water Rat
        - So what if we said something when you restate it question, you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer
        - Because if we just put down Lunar Orbiter
        - They're not going to what we're talking about
        - It gives our reader more information and they can, if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about the main, doesn't it
        - The equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter
        - And yeah STUDENT, I do want some of you did add more details and others, and definitely make sure to add details and
        - You did, and quite a few details
        - Make sure you back things up, it takes like STUDENT Farrah, you know, like in your answer
        - You didn't really back it up
        - Let's see if you STUDENT can reread and find what
        - So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things
        - What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together
        - STUDENT, I want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water
        - I want you to look at what equipment they used to find the water in the craters not were to you
        - Go ahead and look back
        - So you look a couple lines over and see if you can find the name of that Jazmin aright, STUDENT and Oliveron
        - But if you read a couple ones over I think you'll find the name of it
        - So you keep you look down and you read about the
        - I want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle, a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does
        - Did you find so in the text
        - but is the question asking is it right now
        - but I really want to reiterate how important the question is, and really reading it, it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable
        - Not that they're ready
        - Would it be valuable to
        - I want you to read that last paragraph for me, STUDENT
        - Right? So let's keep to that topic, to read
        - They do use a lot of equipment, but we're talking about water on the moon
        - Well, that wasn't an answer, because I'm in our text
        - It didn't talk about that
        - Exactly but you can also use the things that you know to kinda help you look for the answers
        - Now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer, or as close as possible
        - So I want to talk about these two responses for just a moment
        - So whenever we're looking at passages, we really want to focus on textual evidence
        - So, you are correct on finding where the water is now we just have to look a little deeper and figure out how we discovered where this water is
        - And you are absolutely right that is straight from the text, they did find water in these craters
        - But look in your text STUDENT
        - And look, just a few more words
        - What did they call this small machine
        - Yes, you need to be just a little more descriptive in your response
        - But once you add that little extra bit of adding the official name of what equipment was used, then you're going to be on the right track
        - You're right, NASA does use a lot of equipment but we just got to be very specific and identifying which equipment we do
        - But then we have to go back to our question, figure out what it's asking specifically
        - So, you are correct tool and equipment their words that go hand in hand together
        - Can you name one of the words in this question that might be important
        - There's two words that are very important in this question
        - Now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource
        - You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right
        - Do you STUDENT understand how important text evidence is and how it can help you answer your questions and to more importantly justify your answers
        - Now we can pull things from the text but there can always be the possibility that there might be a more detailed answer that we could have given that would have been closer to what the questions asking
        - So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have STUDENT the information that we need in our response
        - So, STUDENT and Deb you you did look in the text and you were on the right track
        - But we could have just went just a little bit deeper into it and got more of a descriptive answer
        - Well, our answers are kind of what we just went over on how we use some of the texts supporting details to prove why Our answer is what it is
        - So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable
        - And another way is when we talked about it being too heavy to carry it also makes it very valuable to have on the moon, so that we don't have to carry it
        - Does that help better explain it to you STUDENT
        - So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible
        - Correct, you got to make sure that you answer the question
        - You got to make sure you add STUDENT of your details, does that help?
        - And when you answer your question
        - So, what you should be looking for in the Texas something more specific about what they're using to discover the water
        - specifically looking for examples of how they discovered the water
        - but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that
        - What was the small machine called it wouldn't be maybe a more solid answer than just the small machine
        - So you could be looking for something more specific
        - So when you're reading
        - So it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - You could you should name that machine
        - And looking for a specific question
        - In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to
        - So that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks
        - If you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it
        - The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines
        - And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer
        - And it answers the question better
        - Okay, so you're when you're reading the informative text, you should be looking for words that jump out to you about
        - So in the text, you should be focusing on what would answer that specific question not not pre knowledge
        - but what it says is, you need a scientific tool called a microscope microscope, you look really closely
        - It doesn't answer the question exactly what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - There's a better answer in the text that's saying what did the scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - You, you just said I circled the same as STUDENT, but you should voice, your own answer is not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates, so that I can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking, you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment, but you're, you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did
        - So you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but they didn't say, full of water
        - You didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting
        - You should be looking for a tool or equipment or maybe machine that they used to discover the water
        - But there's, it's more descriptive
        - But what was the machine called and what did it do?
        - And you're right, it is a small machine
        - They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine
        - So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so I want you to look at your paper and I want you to circle the key words in this question so circle, maybe two key words from this question, I'll give you about 10 seconds to do that
        - When you've circled your two key words
        - If you will just look up at me when you're finished
        - What do you think
        - Okay, so which which were the most two most important words in this question, the two key words
        - 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words
        - What's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover
        - Looks like we're finished
        - Um, so what do you STUDENT think what is another word for equipment
        - I think that you just need maybe a little bit more clarity on it
        - I think you need to add a little bit more
        - Although might have some other knowledge
        - Let's look at specifically at the reading
        - So you although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph
        - You said they sent a small machine, but I think you might need to be a little bit more specific
        - It's just I think you need to maybe add a little bit to it
        - I like that you
        - You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here
        - Sometimes I feel like it, it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking so
        - We are close, but I think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it
        - What I want you to do is I want you to circle the two action words in this question
        - The two main action words
        - Or verbs in this question
        - So I'll give you about
        - And I want you to take your pencil and just circle
        - The two action words in the question
        - What equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment
        - Like STUDENT, or a neighbor
        - STUDENT, I see you have a question
        - I want to hear what you found
        - So next time when we are asked a question instead of saying, I answered it
        - Make sure you write an answer out instead of saying I found the same thing as my friend
        - We can provide with our answer, the better or the stronger answer can be
        - Well, it's always good to add detail to our answers
        - And so the more detail
        - I mean, the more detail
        - When you went to NASA you seen their outfits and those things
        - So they were in our story wearing those outfits, but they just didn't talk about that they really focused on water on the moon because that was the title of our story
        - To discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Can you think about that, and I'll come back to you
        - So can you come up with a new way
        - However, if we were talking just about our reading passage
        - Those are not necessarily in there
        - Does that make a little bit more sense
        - So their ships wouldn't have to carry it
        - Yes, but in your response to you talked about the ships carrying it
        - So really, it wouldn't be coming off of the moon
        - It's probably best to put your own words down inside or instead of just saying that you circled the same answer
        - A STUDENT, because maybe Farrah wasn't pulled into the same group and [teacher name] wouldn't essentially know what you're, what Farrah had wrote
        - Just right exactly what your answer is, whether it's the same as someone else's
        - but um let's pretend that we took away the reading passage and maybe we had read it the day before, and maybe [teacher name] was out that day
        - Do you think that we could have wrote our question differ answer differently to include the question
        - And so maybe the substitute didn't have that
        - Not that your answer is incorrect because I see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said, but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends
        - Maybe if you working in partners of two
        - So that, if you go back into the text and plot the evidence, that's more while we're looking for
        - So rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water
        - Uh, your answer is technically correct
        - The only thing I would change about your answer is if we look back into the text and find more specific evidence that machine that you're referring to what's called a lunar orbiter
        - So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific
        - What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific
        - So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that's the only thing I would add to yours
        - STUDENT right, so what I think we should do, after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question
        - That we can pull out a highlight that we can use to look for the evidence back in the text
        - So if STUDENT looked at that question
        - The first question I answered a
        - Where do you think, what do you think are the, the key words in that question
        - A piece of equipment, but in the text, it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon
        - But do you see how and the question is wanting to know what equipment they used to discover that water so
        - You did put that they found water which is correct, but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water
        - In that sense, your answer doesn't fully answer the question
        - And that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that
        - It's want to know what specifically they used to find that water
        - But for this specific question
        - However, having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic, but it's not specific to that question, if that makes sense
        - Yeah, we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question
        - Did you happen to go back and see what the name of that equipment they used was was the name of that small machine small machine
        - but if we look back in that text we wanted to get a little more specific
        - What do you think are some key words in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question
        - So within that question, just like we talked about in our first session
        - That is one thing I think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading
        - So you could still say I agree with STUDENT, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her
        - What is it that she picked that I agree with
        - Instead of just agreeing with STUDENT, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah
        - Go ahead and think about why you might agree with STUDENT
        - So if we rewrote our answers
        - Okay, STUDENT you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery
        - If we might do that in a minute
        - You just picked the wrong one
        - Maybe in one of the headings or sub headings
        - So look back on your article and look for that word valuable
        - Do you see it anywhere in there
        - Let's go back in the text and see what makes water valuable if it comes from the moon
        - That is an excellent point
        - Why would that be useful
        - So you've given me a really good piece of evidence, but you need to validate that with the next, I would say the next sentence
        - So what is that next sentence say
        - But I want you to think about why that would be useful
        - We're not talking about space, though
        - So let's see if we can use some of our reasoning skills to do that
        - Well that's good that you know a lot about space
        - Right now we're looking at how we answered this question using the text
        - Good, so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, right, because investigate is something you do to discover something, right?
        - And if you need help getting started, you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what? And then write out your response
        - but we have to be a little bit more spits specific in naming what that machine was
        - Okay, so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely, so that we can learn more information about space
        - But that's not what they used to discover it
        - Okay, so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon
        - Alright, so, STUDENT, we want to make sure that we're going back to the text to find our answer
        - So what I'm sort of wondering sort of asked, could you be a little bit more specific, perhaps, and identifying what that small machine could possibly be
        - So to be a little bit more specific you would then, you know, want to choose
        - So if you were able to look at that the idea or the answer of a lunar orbiter would be a little bit more specific
        - But if you were to look through the sort of the article, a little bit more, you know, sort of try to pick out some key words can you use like that type of equipment to discover water on the moon, or would you need some type of other specialized equipment to find water
        - So what I want you to do for just a couple minutes
        - Look back at that question and I want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words That you feel that are important to you, or something that stands out to you
        - Even if you have a questoin, like I'm not sure
        - So this minute, I'm gonna, we're gonna stop for just a minute, take some time and look back that question and circle that okay
        - This is confusing to me
        - Miss Teacher what about this word
        - What's to that to you about that question, something about it
        - Let's talk about the question because we're wanting to first look about what they're asking, and then we'll talk about the text and make connections about
        - First, I want you to look about that question
        - Do you think when you circle that that helps you to bring you back, because you went even deeper because I just asked you, those two words that STUDENT used went in deeper and explained a little bit more that he had a connection with the text and it helps you when he circled that
        - And I want you to work together right to look more into what you circled what you have that connects to the text in the questions
        - So what we're gonna do is, I'm going to break up into even smaller groups because I liked the way I looked at some of Olivers and savannas answers
        - Okay, so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the questions asking and help us to go back to the text
        - So first, what I want you to do is do before is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or word that you feel you don't understand okay
        - Is there STUDENT here because I want to make sure we understand the question
        - One question I want to ask, is there STUDENT here that in this question that you found that there's a word that you're not sure about what it means
        - STUDENT, you also raise your hand about there was concerned about the question
        - STUDENT right, is there anything we have here, right
        - There are some words that you weren't sure about
        - Was it the same word evidence or did you have a different one
        - We need water to survive
        - Now let's let's go a little further back on our texts and see if we can maybe go a little deeper into how they originally discovered it
        - Would you like to maybe give it another go
        - So then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you
        - Okay, well I'm very glad to hear
        - now STUDENT, what's your question?
        - But you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give
        - By throwing in a little something that could be the answer
        - I think for us to build on your answer
        - We'd have a complete full answer to that question
        - I think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment, that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer
        - So you have a good start
        - Scientists found on the moon
        - Now I think when we go back and we read, look at this passage I would like for you to pay close attention to the amount of water
        - But if we when we answer a question we want to be really careful that we're answering the right question
        - It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers
        - We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response
        - If we stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now
        - And so, and usually it's best when we, when we answer a question if we just
        - but do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response as because there are lots of small machines in the world right
        - If we go back into the text
        - I but I think NASA
        - We can see the, the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name, so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer
        - While that might be correct, that is that's broad in the sense that a small machine could be anything from a cell phone to a toaster
        - We want to see what they say
        - Because if I just say NASA sent a small Machine
        - So looking in the text
        - Where could we are, what could we add
        - So I would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine
        - You said NASA send a small machine
        - And give more details what top of small machine was it
        - I just, I would like to build more upon your answer
        - So I would like for you to read the third paragraph so we STUDENT to each go and read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon Luis's answer that he gave us
        - So why don't we try starting our CNS with we know we STUDENT agree that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Know, so sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers that just because it's in the paragraph that that might be information that we don't need to answer this question
        - But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon
        - Microscope is used to discover water, but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope
        - It can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - But I think you're a little confused as to what the questions asking,
        - Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - And STUDENT What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen
        - So instead, let's focus on your opinion
        - It's just what you think
        - But it's always best to face what you think off of facts that you read
        - Whenever you get your opinion or your opinion is your opinion
        - Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true
        - So you don't want to have an opinion
        - Do you understand that
        - So let's look at the question again
        - So your answer doesn't really relate to that question
        - But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes
        - I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - But as far as discovering water, oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that
        - So what do you think may be a better answer as far as, because again, your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space
        - Well, I appreciate your honesty
        - So maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So yeah, NASA definitely send a small machine, but we really need to get into the specifics
        - So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific
        - So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you'll just go back in the text and try to find a specific on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So really, I'm going to encourage you to end your answer
        - Not what STUDENT found so just go in and read maybe read it and just, again, we're looking for what equipment, the scientists use to find water
        - And Oliver, I circled the same I STUDENT
        - Alright, so talk about what you found
        - And talk about yourself, not another student
        - Maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question
        - You answer the question, but maybe instead of saying, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely, relate it back to the scientists were, relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid
        - I know exactly what you're talking about when we answer
        - That way, if I had no clue if I've never read the text, I'll read your question
        - So you're looking for what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So just go back and find that, and I'm going to help another student
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to go back in the text and find textual evidence To go ahead and circle it that answers that question
        - What I would like you to do, though, is instead of just saying, NASA sent a small machine
        - We need to make that answer specific
        - Okay, because as someone that maybe if you were to share your answer with a student that hasn't read the text, would your answer help them very much to understand that piece of equipment?
        - And what else, what identifies that machine
        - Yeah, tell me something about it
        - So probably the machines name as well
        - And just make sure your bringing it from the text
        - t's just we need to make it specific so you'll go ahead and do that
        - So instead of just go in and answer what equipment good scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Just make it specific that way that and I would bring back the question
        - I love when students make the question
        - Alright, so equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon is and then go into your answer
        - So if you will just go back into the text, and I would like you to find which equipment
        - Now you just need to ask, or find what equipment that is
        - So right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        -  Because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable
        - But I would like you to restate the question and then answer the question
        - So STUDENT you have right now is evidence
        - And then you explain that evidence
        - So what you'll do is
        - So for example, you are going to restate the question
        - So is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So you're answering the question, and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that
        - Would say there is convinced
        - There is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable
        - Let me see you again, sorry
        - So there you restated the question you answered the question
        - Then you would say in the text, what it says
        - And then you would explain why that's important
        - Water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen
        - The only thing I would like is just the restate the question
        - You're saying yes, you're just also bringing the question into it
        - Right, if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon
        - Can you STUDENT and then you're off
        - And then you need evidence to support your answer and then you
        - Found the evidence from number six
        - That's perfect, just provide that evidence, and then explain
        - Really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - So now if we'll just restate the question, Answer the question
        - Yeah, so that that's a good train of thought
        - So when we look at yours, you don't necessarily answer the question i can i can tell what you're getting at by reading your evidence, but you don't actually specifically answer the question then provide evidence and then just explain it
        - I would say that you do need more evidence, your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard, but I would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good
        - But let's look back at the question that was proposed
        - So what did the question, what question are we trying to answer
        - Would STUDENT like to reread that for me
        - So does STUDENT have any key words that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for
        - At key word a key word is an important word that it's going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question
        - What equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text?
        - I love that synonym STUDENT, you are spot on
        - So if you STUDENT could take a second to look back in the texts and find Different equipment or tools
        - So I see a lot of hands going up
        - I'm going to give STUDENT a second to read through the text until they find what equipment or tools that they can see
        - Okay, I see some hands going up
        - STUDENT What equipment or tools did you find in the text?
        - And then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon
        - I want you guys to first think about equipment or like STUDENT said tools that would be used
        - So once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon
        - But let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon
        - Oh, we've already get some ideas
        - Helmets and STUDENT the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon
        - Do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon? Let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools
        - STUDENT, what do you see what do you think?
        - So let's look back in the text
        - I want you STUDENT to focus on some key words
        - So I want you STUDENT to take a second to look back in the text, and I want you to circle the words
        - To find water that's absolutely right
        - Is related to a tool that's going to help you find water and I'm going to give you a second just to look back and do that
        - Is when we're looking when we're given a question we have to look at the key words
        - You were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related, but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question
        - So another suggestion is, once you have
        - Once you have decided on your answer, then you need to
        - I think you'll be able to better
        - You can need to look back at that question and make sure that it makes sense
        - And by looking at for those key words and reading that text really closely
        - Make sure that you can restate your answer and that is fully answering that question
        - Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text
        - oxygen tanks bed did not help the scientists found water, but I want you
        - STUDENT So it does talk about oxygen
        - But it doesn't talk about oxygen tanks yes oxygen tanks would be a piece of equipment
        - So we know that one doesn't answer a question
        - and looking for the keywords in your question as well
        - Yes, so keep looking for those keywords in the text
        - I want STUDENT to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph
        - All right, stop right there for me, STUDENT
        - And I want you to either circle or star, the word that you think is most important in that question
        - What was the name of the small machine that was used
        - And we know that microscope isn't the only tool that's you
        - So can you give me a little bit more more detail in your answer
        - See if you can find it
        - That way we can answer the question
        - You STUDENT are going to be looking for key words in the question important words that you could look for back in your text
        - But what I want to do before we start, is take a minute and look back at question number one
        - So take just a second
        - And remember, we are looking for the words equipment and discover
        - Let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph
        - Okay, so if we are looking in paragraph number three, look and reread that real quick
        - What were the key words
        - But what were, what was the keywords in number one
        - And your answer is closer to a correct answer
        - So in your answer does it talk about any equipment that discovered the water
        - So the best place to start is the key words in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer
        - But have we thought about how hydrogen and oxygen
        - Okay so STUDENT talk about it for a minute and let us know in just a second
        - STUDENT see if you can figure out how they are going to use oxygen and how they are going to use hydrogen
        - Um, I have not heard that
        - Did you have a question, your hand was up just a second ago
        - Okay, so you and Farrah and STUDENT Chris
        - But let's think about this text, though
        - Why don't the three of you go back together and Underline in the text important things that water can be used for the astronauts can use it for
        - Um, well, Farrah, Oliver and STUDENT
        - Now that we've kind of talked about the paragraphs that our information is in Jazmin found hers in four STUDENT found his in five
        - But if you want it to be more specific in an answer a good answer, you could have said NASA sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - So STUDENT, you were on the right track
        - And then, to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name what and what is that machine called?
        - And I want you STUDENT to first start with looking back in the question I want you to either underline highlight or circle key
        - Word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question
        - So take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and I want you to circle the key words in this question
        - talk about your answers and how you could have improved those answers to be more specific to
        - That question by using the two words that you STUDENT underlined as keywords
        - So STUDENT You said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - How could you be more specific to the passage
        - But if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how
        - What equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon oxygen piece of equipment, but it doesn't really go with the water on the moon
        - So we need to be more specific, when answering our questions
        - So what keywords help us answer this question
        - About what words, can we underline in that question to help us answer the question
        - So I want you STUDENT to look at the answer that you put for this question
        - I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot
        - You could have put NASA send a small machine and gave the name
        - Your right NASA did send a small machine, but to give a more specific and best answer
        - But the question asked about discovering water on the main so what specific tool
        - This scientist used to discover water on the moon
        - That is a tool that they use
        - Okay, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - So that's when you would want to refer back to the text
        - So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But yes, it's looking for something specific
        - That is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools, like you said, a mask
        - Microscope and stuff like that
        - But then there's one specific tool that it states in the text that that is why you would want to look back in the text to find your answer
        - So just for a second here
        - Go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it
        - What are the some of the main, main words in that sentence
        - Yes, it should be a good answer there
        - But what specific small machine is what the is what the question is asking, so we know that the equipment, but the the actual specific equipment, I think, is what we're trying to find out
        - So if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points of circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer
        - So look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning, using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage
        - I'll give you about two minutes
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a few seconds to do that
        - I want you to think about what equipment was used, and if you see any equipment mentioned, if you can use your pencil and underline it
        - Can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water
        - Can you go ahead and look there and give me a response
        - I just want to make sure we understand
        - It tells you what we need to be able to see this
        - And actually if you look a little further in that same paragraph on the third line
        - Oh, I'm sure if there were actual astronauts in space they would need this equipment, you know, to survive, but I don't really think that's what this passage is focusing on
        - Take a moment, look through and see just which one actually addresses the question
        - I'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question
        - I want you to talk about what you think the correct answer would be and maybe why you think yours is right
        - I have a timer going right now
        - I'm going to give you 30 seconds to do that
        - I know from personal experience when I'm really excited about something I'm interested in, like, for example, music, I'm very interested
        - I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading
        - So maybe in the future use that information
        - But just make sure inside of whatever given takes that you have that you take it, maybe a little bit slower find STUDENT the information there and and then apply that
        - So what it's asking
        - But not necessarily applicable to this specific text
        - We just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what NASA did to find water on the moon
        - But since they sent a small machine, I don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out
        - I want you to take another look at the article, and I want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important
        - And while each of you had really good thought processes
        - Alright STUDENT so What words did you guys pick out that were really important or key terms, in your opinion
        - I definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important, but I think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water
        - I want you to help each other
        - And so now that we know the key words that everybody thinks I want you STUDENT to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water
        - One thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question, as if you were teaching about the question
        - So if somebody was new to reading this passage, just like you STUDENT were, how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you guys are reading
        - Sure, so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student, if you can answer the question, and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer
        - but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon
        - So, that is right, STUDENT
        - They do need a lot of equipment to get there
        - But this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process
        - You know, a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters
        - However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text
        - So, STUDENT, if you would
        - And if you don't, what is mentioned
        - Right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned
        - So I want you to look for that STUDENT look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon
        - What was your answer to that question
        - In the text, you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a text so STUDENT
        - Did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself
        - Because we must always refer to the text
        - The fact that when I break it down the oxygen, hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen And they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel
        - That's why it's valuable
        - but that detail you just added is critical
        - So that's a great answer
        - So that second Part that you just gave me
        - The fact that can they bring water with them can astronauts spray water with them on the on the rocket?
        - I just want to kind of add some detail to it
        - They need that water to be able to drink, but there's something that the text add that makes it even more valuable
        - So your first answer was correct, but that added detail kind of gets to why it is even more valuable than what you mentioned
        - What was that small machine used for
        - Well, your, your answer
        - I just want you to be a little bit more specific about what you're saying there was a small machine used
        - It doesn't have enough water, but it hasn't not enough of something else that we have to have do me a favor
        - I want you to find in the text where it talks about the water being so small that you have to use that kind of told hey
        - So, you missed one part of that because it works as a STUDENT
        - They don't really say that, is where Mr
        - STUDENT talks about that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts
        - It doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks, do they do use them
        - Yes, but not in this text
        - That's what the question was asked
        - It's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples
        - There are some specific Tools that were mentioned and the text
        - No if you remember back in the article
        - See STUDENT these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question
        - So we had to find evidence
        - So we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions
        - Um, well, the question asked, according to the text
        - So you might be right
        - From what you know from your dad going to NASA, we have to use the text in order to answer the question
        - So let's look at paragraph two, and see what other tool we need
        - Yeah, you want to look back in the story and make sure you're answering the whole question that stories like your friend
        - You want to keep looking back, and it has STUDENT your answers
        - You just needed the name of the item that they used
        - Yeah, they definitely need space suits to be in space, but I think they might have used a specific tool in the text to see if there is water on the moon
        - And then STUDENT, I really liked your answer to that you also were thinking about the microscope, I would have loved
        - If you give us another example, or maybe added on to Mars, Venus thought I definitely did like your answer and how you
        - Understand, maybe next time
        - If you have the same idea someone, you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up
        - You could say that to like you can bring an example of
        - Why do you think they're using microscopes
        - Do you think it helped them to find the craters
        - Why they're using microscopes, like when you're reading the text
        - Do you think it made it easier to look for water on the moon, just your thought process
        - I would have loved if you
        - Just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does
        - Just like how you said previously, and then kind of
        - So what you could do is saying, NASA sent a small machine called Lunar Orbiter
        - They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that
        - might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple, like NASA said the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Yeah, like we should fill in the blanks, just to make our sentence a little Meteor
        - But what we're looking for is more of what's in the text
        - So talking about the microscope or the lunar
        - So you can talk about your background knowledge
        - I know that you understand what we're talking about
        - Just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way
        - Yes, Okay, so you can always rephrase your sentence to say that NASA sent a little bit over there that way, I know that you're using the information that's in the text
        - Does that sound good?
        - You can always write that even scientists use a microscope
        - But sometimes there are still things that are so small that they cannot see
        - So I just want you to go a little further in your explanation and you some evidence from what you read about
        - I just think that it sounds like you understand
        - So I just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff
        - However, I just want to make sure that for the future when you're responding to a question about the texts that were reading you of course can bring in background information and stuff you already know about the topic, but make sure that your answer is also specific to what we're reading
        - I also would have liked to see you mentioned the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read, and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon
        - But when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read, just try and incorporate
        - So the text mentions the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding Craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks
        - Something specifically from the text
        - But the big idea of the story is the Lunar Orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon
        - And they definitely do need to use a microscope
        - But I also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part
        - yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct um, but I want you to elaborate a little bit more so, yes NASA sent a small machine, but what was that small machine called
        - Right, so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing, because it shows that
        - But you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you
        - So it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge, but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text
        - However, again when you look at that question, it asks what equipment found those craters of water, so that would be similar to STUDENT where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water
        - yeah so Oliver and STUDENT that would be where I would like you to like adjust your response, so I think you had really good answers, but you just want to try and make sure that
        - you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future
        - And what you could do with that so in your response um you could have added something like in another article I read, it said that there could be a base on the moon, and then connect to the article we're reading now, so do you have any idea of how you could do that
        - pretty good I would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore, because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon
        - I would probably just expand your response, so you could
        - You just, um, didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own
        - You just said you circled the same thing as STUDENT
        - So I really wanted to hear in your own thoughts, not in Farrah's thoughts, um, what you found in the passage and how you did it
        - Well, I just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question, you said that NASA used a small machine I wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon
        - Okay Okay, so when you're answering so next time when we have questions, make sure you're answering STUDENT parts of the question and as much detail as you can
        - Look at the microscope in context of how it was used to find water on the moon that's what I wanted you to bring to me
        - you explain to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does, but I wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon
        - I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start
        - I think that you could have, you could have maybe expanded on a little more on instead of saying like I scientists found craters for water on the moon, you could maybe as is answer, while also kind of expanding upon it by like adding like blah blah blah
        - I know it wasn't too long of a thing to read, so he couldn't really expand upon it as much
        - You know, I have you STUDENT heard about thinking outside the box
        - Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way
        - But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it
        - I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box
        - Your idea is not really working
        - So like when say like someone asked you to build a house right um and your ideas that you had before
        - So you're kind of running out of ideas and sometimes thinking outside the box like instead of doing it like this normal approach like the typical way of doing it
        - Um, well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying, NASA send a small machine, but, um, you could have talked about what that machine was and how it But, um, yeah
        - So you weren't you weren't wrong
        - Oh, it's just, I'm a little too broad
        - So the maybe expand on your point, which was a good point
        - The only thing I would say to add is maybe you could, because you said a lot of equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks
        - You could say, like, they also use like special helmets and like a special like space suit or something like helmet
        - a suggestion I have for you
        - To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help
        - on future astronauts or scientist when they get to the moon um which could maybe like oh i'll add some valuable evidence to your sentence, which is on
        - Pretty key to STUDENT this um
        - so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like
        - A reason why, like the thing that they found to be important in La um I know that's a lot,
        - um I it's not wrong it's just you can add a little bit you can add more to it and have it be a more complete dot not that isn't like a complete thought, but like
        - A suggestion I had written down when I looked at STUDENT the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say
        - NASA send an equipment, called the Lunar orbiter which is put that help the astronauts discover more on them
        - So maybe like adding like a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence
        - But i'm just i'm hoping that you know that the challenge of having maybe a longer sentence or breaking it maybe breaking it into two
        - can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um
        - um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks, you can maybe mentioned, like the soup thing where because that's also equipment, because they needed to be up there on
        - um okay um can you do, you tell me in your own words, why it's not ready, using using what's in the passage, but in your own words okay
        - But yeah i'm so STUDENT had a good answer it could have been longer but
        - I mean, I, as I said last time, adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse um so so STUDENT your answer was awesome like
        - um alright so STUDENT water, you said water can be split into two parts, hydrogen and oxygen great job on that um So could you kind of tell me why
        - Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen
        - um because, again, as I said, adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and
        - But I wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used
        - There was us a little bit more details,
        - I wish they had a little bit more details like for Oliver and STUDENT
        - You STUDENT had some really good responses for a couple of them
        - Your answer is not wrong but it's not correct, you said yes, they use a small machine and the Lunar orbit is a machine, but it was not as specific as I would have wanted to hear
        - If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar
        - This did use a lot of equipment like you said what you use your background knowledge, instead of the evidence from the text that you were supposed to eat like I wanted
        - Using the information already gave you about what they actually sent to the moon, to find the water, how would you change your answer because they didn't use oxygen tank to go find the water, because nobody exactly was on the loan when they found the water machine found it
        - I don't think the microscope is a second answer is a microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object, you want to look at under the microscope
        - but I also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response
        - So maybe what you found from the text, along with what you thought about it
        - Does that sound good
        - Yeah, like your personal views, along with what you found from the text
        - But like I said to her, maybe personalize it a little bit, add your own views sound good
        - But we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote
        - So do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly
        - Our question was sorry I have to pull it back up
        - Well, your answer wasn't necessarily incorrect
        - You had some really good vocabulary terms, but you weren't completely answering our question
        - So that's a really good start, but at your next point, you should add in what comes next, and the texts, a reading
        - So, STUDENT, like we were saying, I think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step, read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond
        - But in this particular text
        - So maybe next time
        - We're learning about one specific thing
        - If we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion, we'd have a stronger response is that okay
        - Your answer is not necessarily wrong I just think we could expand on it further, so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two, is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now
        - That would be more information yeah that would make your answer a little bit more
        - what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more, you know, on task What you said is good but it's a little
        - it's a wide range for an answer, so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay
        - That is true, that is where they discovered the water, but the question was the equipment that they used
        - we're talking about the equipment, so you did name, where we found it, but the question is more focused on the equipment
        - Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me
        - And it could be right, yes, but it doesn't reflect on our texts and the main point here is that we're trying to ask from the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them
        - And you notice an example of what helped them decided the water on the moon was sufficient enough for us, however, that wasn't the tool they used for the to discover the water
        - STUDENT, you had a great response
        - So that was good but next time I want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water
        - So the question was asking for what they used to discover and that was in the text above us
        - It was a great example but not exactly what we were looking for
        - With your response you talked about what they would use to check if the water was sufficient enough
        - They use the equipment they use
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the machine
        - You just needed to go a little further to name the women they use
        - You realize that STUDENT had a good answer
        - And you agreed with her, but next time I would like you to either add on to something She says, based on the text or you can make up your own, go say your own answer
        - So you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it
        - Um, but for next time I would just like you to add on
        - So you see how she said microscope
        - They use a microscope to find the closer look in the water
        - You could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text
        - Or if  you disagree or anything
        - So we're not STUDENT saying the same things
        - Just adding on to the discussion
        - Um, it seems like you didn't quite understand the text, which is okay
        - And based on your answer
        - I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher
        - It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time
        - Next time I just want you to get a deeper look into the text and think closer about the question
        - But you need to go a little further and see the first tool they used to find the water in the first place
        - My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response
        - or ask a question if you're confused and um because STUDENT also
        - My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something
        - So I see where you agreed with STUDENT
        - question if you're confused and look closely at the passage
        - was almost there, but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra
        - It actually wasn't wrong, and I see where you answered your question, I just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start, and you was almost there you just needed to name the equipment, so you you were on the right track
        - Yes, that is correct, so you just needed, you were in the right track, you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response is make sure you as specific as possible, but you had a great start
        - yeah that's actually great background knowledge for this assignment and it could also help you, but the question that we are being asked
        - Is the specific equipment, the scientists use to find the water
        - and for your response STUDENT, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph
        - To see the exact equipment they used
        - You, the background knowledge is very helpful to understand the passage better, I just want you to look into the text to find the equipment they used
        - Similar to STUDENT, I just want you to look closer at the passage, specifically the second paragraph, which it talks about the equipment they use,
        - I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer
        - Exactly great observation and another thing is, if anything, you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence, but good job yeah exactly
        - If you're always confused you can always go back and read the text and um and use evidence, if anything to help you to sort out the answers
        - But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely
        - So it's always good to bring in that background knowledge, but if the question isn't asking for that specific answer let's try to focus on what it is asking and where we can find it in test text
        - Okay, so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully
        - So the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So what you want to say in your
        - Response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine, which is good that you mentioned, NASA
        - You said I remember your response
        - We want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text
        - But you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific
        - Yeah, you have to write more stuff
        - STUDENT I remember in your response
        - Like STUDENT talking about being more specific and pulling things from the text
        - But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text
        - You, you talked about how they use equipment
        - You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good
        - So if you STUDENT are having trouble thinking of an answer, you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text
        - Even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you
        - I still want you to say an answer, because I want STUDENT to be giving an answer
        - And I don't want you to just say that you have the same answer
        - Tool a microscope to look really closely
        - That's a good response, but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific
        - You want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon
        - We want to be using that
        - Good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text just add in it and say um they use the microscope in order to see the water
        - You have to add more words
        - You want to make sure that - it's STUDENT about being specific
        - You want to use good examples from the text
        - But you didn't talk about the equipment
        - The question asked for you to talk about the equipment
        - This is for everybody, not just STUDENT, when you are talking about
        - So when you STUDENT are
        - when you are going to answer the question you want to make sure that you answer STUDENT parts of the question and that you're specific as possible
        - So you STUDENT are getting there you're almost there, but my main concern for the three of you is that you didn't fully answer the question as it's stated
        - So for the three of you Farrah Jazmin and STUDENT when you go back and read, I want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind
        - And yes, you talked about equipment, but I want you to really focus on the discovering water what equipment discovered water
        - STUDENT you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking
        - You didn't mention what like you just wrote a small machine it's not very specific,
        - so I want you to go back and reread and be more specific, because we want specific answers
        - And STUDENT, you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks
        - So oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage
        - you're right about that, but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water, I want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer
        - So I want you to reread the question because I don't think you fully understood what the question was asking
        - Because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment, it just said that water was found on the moon, which is right that's what we're talking about water being found the moon so
        - so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need
        - And, as I talked, as I said, to STUDENT she said microscope which is -was mentioned in the passage, but for you, my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that Farrah, so yours was the same as Farrah
        - So I would love if you go back, reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because I want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer
        - so STUDENT I want you to go back and look for anything that in the passage that the passage reads not any information that you know from outside just specifically in the passage that water can be valuable to us
        - So um that can be useful useful helpful something any kind of detail
        - But I just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence, because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage
        - So I want you to so as I just said to Farrah and to STUDENT of you, that is, I want you to look for any information details facts that water can be helpful
        - drink the water, so that is a fact, but I want you to go back because there is more stuff in there, so I want you to reread the question and then go back in the passage and look for evidence
        - Yes, so you know to reread the question and then go back to the passage to find the information that the question uses
        - So going back to what STUDENT said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine
        - But what does it do? To answer the question in context
        - I want you to look at paragraph 2 again
        - Just pause for a second, I don't want you to read it, I want you to look at it and then try to interpret that into a sentence like STUDENT did
        - now before you share the answers with the STUDENT, I want you to independently for one minute circle key words or words that you think are important in the question I want you to circle them and then I want you, in one minute to share back with me what you circled
        - Can STUDENT do that?
        - So we're going to look at the reading and the first part, and I want you to circle again independently equipment that you see in the reading - equipment listed
        - So when you look at paragraph two and three you're going to try to see keywords that may make a microscope and lunar orbiter two different types of equipment
        - Does that make sense? so why don't you do that for one minute
        - I want to do that for one minute and then come back
        - So, looking back at the first question I want you to independently for one minute I want you to circle any key words or important words that you see in the question that you think are important
        - And I want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading
        - Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear
        - We're looking at when they used to find the water
        - One part you were missing, though, is
        - So what were they looking at closely
        - What they were looking at
        - Right, so just that one little extra step
        - Could really just push through your answer
        - So you had part of the what you just needed
        - Just make sure when you're writing answers like this, you need to be very clear about the what and the why
        - But I also want to make sure that you're getting an understanding for what you're eating as well, not just looking to answer the questions
        - Okay, so you're coming from the right, you're coming from the right intention of your reading
        - It's just we need more specifics
        - You don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read
        - So when we're answering questions like this, you need to have the specifics
        - You need to be able to
        - So, STUDENT when you're looking at these answers
        - So you got that you got you got the equipment
        - Look at the what they're asking for
        - Next time, just make sure if it has a name include the name
        - You need to have a little more details
        - You had what they discovered, but can you help me
        - Look for examples of how they discovered it in the reading and you may use some examples that Jazmin or Farrah and STUDENT had but let's let's figure it out together
        - But we need to be a little more detailed
        - but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there, but we just need to make it a little bit big, we need to make it a little bit more detail
        - Your that is so true that's so true, but it doesn't answer our question for this one, so, while they do use those equipment, that's not what we're looking for for this question
        - So while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon
        - What useful important so saying that it can be split into hydrogen and oxygen is true, but it doesn't totally answer this question so
        - If you look at what the positives are it might outweigh the time that it takes, so it is possible for water to be valuable on the moon  so STUDENT can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon
        - I really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought to answer the question, not the same as STUDENT
        - So, my concern is is that you're not you're not understanding completely by yourself, you know that STUDENT circle, the same one as you
        - But I do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon, if you want to look in paragraph two, and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used
        - yeah so my suggestion to you in the future is just to remember those key words because those key words like the Lunar orbiter that's an important thing to know for our vocabulary in the future in this lesson
        - Yes, I see how you connected your background knowledge to the text for reading right now, but my only concern is is that you didn't answer the question that I originally asked
        - which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon
        - But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry
        - And it's awesome you have that background knowledge, because you can later apply it, and you can pull that in the back of your mind
        - But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is
        - My suggestion would be to go through and look for equipment, like me and then we'd be able to find what machine was used
        - yeah maybe look for equipment like different pieces of equipment
        - So do you STUDENT see anything that could support your answers from the text
        - And she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover, we think, how did they find water on the moon
        - They are using the microscope to look at the water
        - However, I like how STUDENT really looked at the question
        - That's a good place to start
        - So first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question
        - Why, what are your answer, maybe not answer the questions
        - However, we need to think about our phrasing of the question
        - Um, so yeah, so we found our answer
        - But just some common mistakes, I think, are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text I know
        - We want to really reference, the text, just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text, you know
        - I think it's important that, when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked Oh, how do you know that, how do you know this is true, you can say Oh, I found it in this source or you can say, you can quote the text
        - um so would STUDENT maybe like to revise their answer? and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word?
        - So now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language STUDENT would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed yeah
        - But what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just, just like the ones that we just talked about, like microscope
        - Like Orbiter, things like that
        - So we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading
        - But I want to hear more specific answers in that
        - What kind of small machine that they send like what, what did they use once they sent it when they brought it back like
        - I just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine, it is in the reading
        - but I want you each to come up with your own individualized answers
        - But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading STUDENT three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used
        - STUDENT, I want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words,
        - But, that doesn't truly answer the question
        - What did they use to see the water
        - You did say a fair point
        - So you didn't quite answer the question there
        - So if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use
        - and try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay
        - Your thinking so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here, this is how, if it were me I would start this sentence, but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence, I would say to discover water on the moon, the scientist used blank
        - Alright Farrah will STUDENT you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again, if you have to and highlight and underline
        - And you look, you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank
        - that's what that would be a good start so again my same suggestion, think about the question think of it in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline STUDENT of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading
        - I didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was I circled the same as STUDENT
        - Now i'm sure you serve you did circle, the same as STUDENT Farrah his answer was the microscope, but I want you to come up with your own words and your own answers, yes, you and samantha might have had the same answers
        - What types of equipment use on the reading not not necessarily you and STUDENT I want to know exactly what depth saw in the reading so again, the example sentence might help you
        - Perfect STUDENT right now I want you to do the same thing and go back and do the reading again and I want you to pull out another one okay
        - I want you STUDENT to take 35 seconds, and I want you to reread the reading, but I want you, while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading Okay, and try and make it stuff that you haven't already talked about near responses okay
        - I want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay
        - Perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me
        - You said that NASA sent a small machine that's perfect NASA did send a small machine, but I want you to add more I want you to build on that now, you went back and you highlighted the Lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one
        - Perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them okay
        - I just want to know why I just want to know what type of equipment they used to find the water in those creators so did you go and highlight two types of equipment
        - awesome you should put that in your answer to, then you know a lot about space okay wow
        - And Farrah had a lovely answer that was great, but I want an answer from depth, I want to know what STUDENT found in the reading I want to know what to tools Oliver found it's great
        - So we need to build your sentence, because we only have a little bit so, how would you start your sentence
        - So your answer is right, but you will have -didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name
        - Alright STUDENT, so, when we look back at the question
        - While it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often, it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - Do you see how you can fix your answer a little bit?
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - You are correct, NASA sent a small machine
        - So to fix your answer just a little bit
        - And just a simple fix
        - We can put on it is at the words, called a microscope, at the end of it
        - That's STUDENT you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect
        - I love, how you work together with her, and I think it's great to work with your classmates in STUDENT but, for your answer, I want to hear what you have to say
        - my only suggestion for you like, your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue
        - Otherwise your answer is perfect
        - In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that
        - Well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and I think it's really important to work with your classmates, but when answering your question on your own paper, I really would love, if you could explain your answer, rather than, say you didn't listen to someone else
        - But the question is what small machine discovered the water, so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water know what found it
        - What I suggest, what you STUDENT do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords and in the question, it states verse it says What small machine or not, what equipment did scientists use to discover water
        - but the microscope was to discover to look at the water that was already discovered
        - And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used
        - That's it to make your answer perfect
        - So you're definitely right about how NASA uses so much equipment to do so many different things, but the answer the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water,
        - That is true and it's basically just what I told STUDENT, that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things, but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water
        - but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not STUDENT the other machines
        - So I love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks
        - But I really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question
        - So do you think you can show me maybe something for the text that would also
        - But I do not believe that was in the article itself
        - So in your next response, you could say a scientific tool use
        - So when next time when you're doing this, maybe explain what the microscope was used for
        - Was the microphone scope to look really closely at the water because that was what the question was asked, so three jobs
        - But I think what I was looking for is a little bit more information on
        - STUDENT, you said that NASA send a small machine which is completely correct
        - What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine
        - So do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information
        - But I wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon
        - And maybe what the machine was called
        - But I don't think they use those to necessarily find the water
        - I think they use those to be signed sun, the moon, but for this question
        - Look really closely at things, which is true
        - But I asked him into then go on and say, how did the microscope
        - Microscopic so that's why STUDENT said that, and which is why spins and ended up being really great because she explained how the instrument was used to find the water
        - So does that make sense
        - Yes, so she took the instrument, she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water
        - In this text, it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used, so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see, specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer
        - The question fully, you would need to describe the exact small machine that was found
        - So, your answer was close but it you just missed a tiny part of the question, so you got water and you got equipment, but you needed to look at how it was discovered not how it was looked at afterwards
        - so let's STUDENT look back at the reading and see if we can find any important clues that might tell us right away what the answer is
        - When we are answering the question we're looking to answer with evidence from the text
        - And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question
        - I think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable
        - That the water is heavy and that it takes up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question as if how that would be valuable, so what me and STUDENT were talking about was that, yes, the spaceship
        - would carry the water, it would be too heavy but then your response should have something about why it not the water not being carried would be a good thing, so just elaborating a little bit off of that of how
        - Right, so that is what you would put into your answer, just to explain and relate back to the question that's being asked
        - but maybe we could elaborate and and why, why do they use this tool
        - What does this tool, help them with
        - Can you kind of elaborate on that response
        - Can you tell me why you need a microscope
        - So Referring to the water on the moon text
        - it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover
        - To help you understand this question, but this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water, yes, they do use that equipment to help them discover the water, but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water
        - So you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon, but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response, you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like Farrah and STUDENT added
        - However, they needed to use a specific equipment to really, really find water because it was very, very hard to find
        - They did use that because we can not breathe the air in the moon
        - So we did use that, STUDENT
        - You're totally right about that one
        - Chris and STUDENT, I'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use
        - Okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that NASA send a small machine, this is not incorrect, they did send a small machine, however, in the text it provided the
        - Actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was
        - Alright, so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you STUDENT each a highlighter and you are going to be read the section
        - The second section paragraphs three, through six of the text, and then I want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable
        - And then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does STUDENT have any questions before we start
        - So now i'm giving your highlighters you're going to go through those sex that section that you just read and I want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon STUDENT have any questions before we start that
        - That that definitely is it to a microscope is a tool, but I like STUDENT, what you did is they use the word the water they found is microscopic
        - But they never said they need to use a microscope
        - But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope
        - So, that that is a correct answer a small machine I were just looking, I guess I'm just looking for more specific, so later in the sentence, they get a little bit more specific
        - I just have a question for you to think about
        - When you are giving a response after reading a text, it's always a good idea to include evidence
        - Thank you for sharing your responses on that reading
        - Does anyone know what ways they can include evidence? STUDENT?
        - So sometimes if we just include the quote, we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote
        - So it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts, the writer's thoughts
        - I don't want you to think about it as right and wrong, but we can always make our answers better, right? So the more details we add can make them better
        - So that's another thing we want to consider when we're thinking of our answers, is does this answer the question that's being asked? Because sometimes our answers are very true and relate to the story but are not related to the original question
        - And if you have more information to add, that's great
        - But we really want to focus on what we're reading
        - No? So maybe you already knew that piece of information, but you can find another piece of information from the text
        - You can add that later
        - So right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text, and we always want to do that first
        - That way we can back up our answer with evidence from the story
        - We want to say both, right? We always want to use our own words and also include some of the author's words or thoughts
        - So what you did was you answered the question, but we need more tools to, maybe, think further on our answers
        - But maybe we can use another tool like rereading through STUDENT of the text, right? And then, if we reread through the text, we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article
        - So you're not wrong, it is a small machine, but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification, so it's nice and clear
        - So that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific
        - Now, you are completely correct that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - That's what our article is about, but what I'm looking for what equipment they used
        - Maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used
        - Like the Lunar Orbiter that Jazmin was talking about or even the microscope that STUDENT was talking about
        - And that you know that they use a lot of different tools
        - So even though, you do have your background knowledge
        - We just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question
        - Nope, your answer is correct, but to answer the actual question that we brought into it, which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yeah, so that's how you would want to broaden your, your, your response
        - You could say, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that could be useful in your response
        - but we just need to beef it up a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary
        - You might want to add that into your answer as well, to be very concrete and make sure you're using STUDENT your resources from the passage
        - And you agree with STUDENT, which is awesome but you kind of want to put it into your own words
        - I kind of wanted to talk to you about your answer
        - So I think that would be a great detail to add in your answers
        - So incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading
        - But if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand
        - You don't have to write down STUDENT of them
        - You know what I'm saying
        - We can build on this sentence by saying, NASA sense and the machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in the craters
        - We want to have enough words to describe what we're thinking
        - However you the you use the words exactly from the passage, so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand, but I want you to put it in your own words to show me that
        - So, saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got STUDENT that information from reading the passage
        - Exact put it in your own words or that you understand
        - But I'd like for you to explain why you chose that answer
        - And I think you did a great job of showing me that
        - So, so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to NASA
        - So our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon
        - Those are some of the words I want to hear in your answer
        - But we need to highlight the equipment
        - so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions, we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that NASA sent but you're absolutely right now send
        - So, like, I told for STUDENT when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well okay
        - and make sure and see how small it is and really scope it out, we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it
        - So let's do a sentence spring
        - So instead of saying, NASA sent a small machine, you could use our vocabulary word Lunar Orbiter
        - Can you repeat that with me, NASA sent a lunar orbiter
        - Oh, your answer was not wrong
        - I think that we can add more details to your answer to your answer
        - Well, your answer wasn't wrong you actually had a really good answer, but we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer,
        - yeah like you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those word to equipment that they used to discover water on the moon
        - but do you think that that's answering the question
        - part of the question do you think you're missing
        - Right, so it seems to me that you really understand what you're trying to say it just, i'm a little concerned that the reader of
        - whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could
        - So you could say one way that the that water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen says, what do you think, do you think that sounds better
        - A way that I could see you making a response, even better, is kind of adding the question into the response
        - My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and
        - Keep the first part of your answer, but only make that your first part and then
        - Go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct
        - I think it would be really hard to get it ready too
        - I think that's a really good point but let's think back to what I just said to STUDENT do you have any thoughts of how you could make your answer a little bit stronger
        - Right, I really liked that you bought up evidence from the reading I think that's a great idea, so I would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading
        - yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes STUDENT
        - One thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question
        - And so you said you need a Microsoft microscope to look really closely, but one
        - That is a really good answer
        - So remember, our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more
        - So you had STUDENT of the right information
        - Like, if I were to answer your question I'd use your exact words I say something like, to discover water on the moon
        - So if I look at it without the question I still know what you're talking about
        - You need a specific scientific tool called Microsoft to look really closely
        - So if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context
        - You're right, it is the right answer, but we want to just add a little bit more to STUDENT of our answers to make them a little bit stronger
        - Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called
        - It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        - That was something that was in our text water on the moon
        - And so adding small details like that can really strengthen our response
        - You added more words and you added specific details
        - So when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of what was that
        - And you've told me where on the moon
        - The question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - The water was discovered
        - So what can you add to your thoughts to just make it a little bit stronger
        - So, is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger
        - but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see
        - But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?
        - Right, so one suggestion that I have for you is maybe i'm being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response
        - That we can make it just a little bit better um so one concern I have about your response is that I was just reading your response kinda like I was just reading savannas and I wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking right because
        - So I think yeah yeah, so I think one suggestion I have for you, like the suggestion I had for STUDENT would just to be to add a few more specific details, so that I and your peers can
        - is needed for astronauts to breathe, and so, if you added that to your response, it would help me and any of your friends, reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us, yes STUDENT
        - And i'm similar to the feedback, I was just giving STUDENT um I just don't get your answer just doesn't necessarily remind me of the question right like how Is that why water is valuable why it's valuable to get it from the moon, or why
        - To restate the question exactly So if you restate the question you say something like
        - Okay, so let's start with you
        - STUDENT So you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon
        - So I in the article I don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks, however I know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks
        - They didn't talk about that in the, in the passage
        - but I just -did you -this phrase in general, would you wrote was not used
        - So did you have questions about the passage?
        - or is there a statement that you might think of or an answer to the question that you might have based with evidence from the reading?
        - That's true, yeah, maybe it is, but I think there's something to think about is that when we're doing these assignments, we want to make sure that we're using the reading to backup our thoughts and to use evidence from the reading
        - I think a next time
        - If there's something we could Oliverelop that a little bit more like talking, you can say, you know what kind of small machine did they use
        - Or different things like that
        - Just Oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already, then you already have
        - But there's nothing wrong with your answer
        - Instead of just saying, NASA used a small machine, you could say, NASA used the lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - So you could say, NASA, so like it said in the reading, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - and we want to make sure we're going to, we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers
        - Now, although they did and that is correct, that answer wasn't necessarily answering the question
        - So your - STUDENT, your response with scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Because we were asking about equipment, not what they found
        - I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at STUDENT of the tools that they referenced because
        - Yes they did use telescopes but sometimes they also use that there are other tools that they utilize as well, so I just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting STUDENT of the points possible
        - I have my question to you is did you understand the reading completely like did you did you have questions about it?
        - Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading?
        - Because we want to make sure that when you are working
        - Even though you're working with your partner and sometimes when you work independently you won't be able to have the person to bounce ideas off of
        - and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as STUDENT in this case
        - So I think yeah I mean it's super important and really awesome that you're able to build off of the background knowledge and build off of the knowledge that you already have and what you already know
        - I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading
        - You know, having a conversation with someone talking about what kind of equipment do scientists need or things like that, then
        - Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right
        - So, but we have an assignment and there's a reading and it tells us the different things that they use and the equipment that they use to make certain discoveries or things like that we want to make sure that we're using what's in the text versus what we already know prior
        - But I feel as though, like with a few of your other parents your answer can use a little bit more umpf, they could have he could have a little bit more to it
        - yeah that's that's totally okay um so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that were being as clear as possible
        - It still has the same, it is the same, it does almost the same thing that your answer had that you wrote down but it just gives that a little bit more power to prove and to show that you are able to go back and reference, the text, while also understanding what you read
        - yeah so what I, so what I meant by that, basically, is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text, so instead of saying like you wrote
        - Not yeah more words but you want to make sure that you don't necessarily have it's not always more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference, the text in your reading
        - They talk about in the text, but I think that you can add even a little bit more they do talk about different types of equipment or different things that they could use or that they might need
        - While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering
        - That you can add a little bit more that's kind of the whole point of all of you, being in this STUDENT today
        - your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more
        - information from the texts or like direct quotes or like add the names of the machines, instead of generalizing it yeah STUDENT
        - Your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was so the question was asking, so the first question
        - so with  your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter, but didn't add more to it
        - They found the craters by using the Lunar orbiter helped them find the craters on the moon you just needed to add that little extra bit at the end of it to make sure that you really got the answer
        - I just wanted to see where you found it
        - I wanted to have like specific textual evidence, I know you found it in the text, but I wanted you to point it out to the rest of the STUDENT knows where to look
        - so your response says that they found craters full of water
        - But you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use, or do they use to find the craters
        - When I heard your response
        - You just sent you said that NASA sent a small machine
        - You were a little vague
        - You just stated evidence
        - Okay, so STUDENT your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence
        - yeah using evidence from the text, you have to state whether or not it is a valuable resource
        - Because your answer could have gone either way
        - You could have said no
        - Water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes, because it does split this and that, and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive, so I assumed that you were agreeing, but I don't want to have to assume
        - just like STUDENT he didn't really state if it would be a good thing, so I had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree
        - So the only part that I would, the only suggestion I have for you and this suggestion is for everybody, not just STUDENT
        - Is that in your answers, I would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so
        - A suggestion I would say, is, I know this because, in paragraph four, it states
        - And then so Oliver, you said you circled the same as STUDENT, but I think we want to go deeper into that, and I want you to have your own answer
        - Your answer is not wrong at STUDENT
        - I loved your answer, STUDENT
        - But can you tell me what the machine is? Can you be a little bit more specific about that?
        - So when we're saying our answers, we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general
        - So if you have a specific thing from the text, definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on
        - So when we're looking at our answers, I want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well
        - So like in the text, what small machine
        - Are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine
        - We want to be very specific
        - So that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was lunar orbiter which is a small machine
        - But we just want to make sure we're super specific about it
        - So that's STUDENT you have to say
        - So when you're saying, just make sure you specify just be like, Well, I do know from previous information that they have to use oxygen tanks, because there's a very limited amount of oxygen in space
        - In the text we can go deeper into the text and find more answers, like the machines and tools and equipments to find that in your answer and get more evidence and details into that response, and that would be great
        - Just make sure that we're going deeper into the text, one more reading it, so we can find even more information, because that answer was pretty good, very good
        - But if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing
        - So I would look definitely more closely, like, I told savannas and you STUDENT circle, the same thing and find some more other tools or more evidence from the text that we can use and support your answer in the question
        - In your answer it's very vague, so it just says a small machine
        - so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in
        - That makes sense? to add yeah I think you think I just have to add the Lunar orbiter to my answer yep and make sure you use evidence from the text to support that
        - scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states, so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is, is incorporated into your answer
        - but in the question, we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water
        - yep so the microscope and the Lunar orbiter were definitely use, but I want you to go through the text yourself, and I want you to make sure that you can find yourself where that came from and what the evidence is to support that in the text
        - So one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer, so you can say in paragraph two
        - And they didn't use a lunar orbiter which was similar to Jazmin's so STUDENT of you, in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response, so we can all say like in this paragraph, I found in your answer
        - So we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text
        - Instead, your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading
        - but I would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text
        - Like for example, we know that NASA used the Rover to find water on the moon
        - But what I want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response, you know what I mean? Just try to pick out details from the text
        - You know, earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information, so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text
        - STUDENT, your answer is not wrong
        - We just want to work to be a little more specific and then we want to work to explain how we know what we know
        - So instead of saying small machine, we know that the small machine was called a lunar orbiter, so we want to try to be a little bit more specific
        - Instead of saying small machine we want to say lunar orbiter
        - Yeah, next time that would be really great
        - You want to make sure that when you're reading a text, you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to it as possible
        - All right, STUDENT, your response was really great
        - I know you have so many great thoughts
        - I love that you kind of collaborated off of Farrah's idea, but what I want to see from you is to articulate something that you found interesting that someone else didn't necessarily say
        - I want you to try to, when you're answering questions about text, I want you to try to look for specific things
        - And even if you share the same ideas as your classmate, try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking
        - For example, if STUDENT has the answer, then you can say the same answer, but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it
        - So when you're reading a question from about something you want to make sure they look and you want to see, we know what creates this question and what information, am I going to be looking for
        - So we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word, so I want you to work with your partner
        - And I want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then I want the person on the right to go after so I want you to work for two minutes and I want you to look and choose one really important words, the question
        - Where Am I find these words and the passage alright, so you have two minutes, with your partners
        - I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you STUDENT a minute to do that
        - STUDENT right now that you guys circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and I want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned
        - that's a really great job Okay, we want to make sure that we focus on the text okay that's a little bit of a concern that I have is just
        - Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says
        - um lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned, however, I also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment, as it is just something that's mentioned as an object
        - person it's really great job i'm just I would I really wouldn't want to urge you to make sure that we focus on what is mentioned in the moon, is a desert
        - And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you STUDENT, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon
        - And I also love that you using your new knowledge of equipment and you're realizing you know where where you can get a little bit more specific with your answer and the equipment that they use
        - Because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use
        - We can add some evidence into our answer
        - But the question was, what equipment did scientists use to discover that? So are craters full of water-- is that a type of equipment?
        - I want you to look back into the reading though we need to circle the evidence, where it talks about where you want to answer
        - You need to have specific evidence in the reading
        - It's a small machine and we want to get super specific when we're answering these questions from a nonfiction text
        - Like we're reading now
        - You want to be as specific as we can
        - So it's a real text with real facts
        - So would you want to add that to your answer
        - But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter
        - The question you want to make sure you're answering what the questions asking about the equipment expand specifically
        - You got to remember it their equipment equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well
        - Does that make more sense of how you have to make sure that you're answering the full question when they say equipment
        - So what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question
        - It's small machine called
        - So STUDENT you have to do is add that to your answer to make it super specific and to somebody who didn't read this article
        - They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we STUDENT knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it
        - Yes, Deb, you have a hand up
        - So now we know to look, you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions
        - Yeah, just that was kind of from your prior knowledge
        - We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers
        - So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer
        - And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer
        - Does STUDENT want to talk about their response first
        - So there you go
        - STUDENT So we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts
        - but we do want to add to your answer
        - What that water is used for for the astronauts
        - Maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer
        - And we want to go a little bit further, we want to dig a little bit deeper
        - But we want to explore a little bit further
        - Can you find the sentence that Jazmin just talked about when it talks specifically about the Lunar Orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for STUDENT of you
        - You two can start working on your second answer
        - When you go back, I want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves, what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text
        - Go back to the question and reread it, please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note Of what kind of answer
        - STUDENT, you identified the main idea of this passage
        - If you get stuck, and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help
        - Think about restating the question in your answer
        - I want you to expand your
        - Ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read, could they learn that information from your answer
        - Your answer isn't wrong STUDENT
        - I want you to expand your answer
        - I want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine
        - So I want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment, the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question
        - I did you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject
        - I want you to read through the passage and just and see if you can find another example of an equipment that was before the microscope that helped us know that we even should be using a microscope to look very small bits of water
        - Identify what kind of answer the question is asking for
        - What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion
        - The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and STUDENT for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text
        - But I want you to learn a little bit from Chris Jazmin and STUDENT about giving reasons why you think your, your answer
        - STUDENT Have you learned anything from
        - So I when I tell you to go back and finish up your work, please use that evidence to support your answer
        - And that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon
        - And I'm going to talk to you one on one
        - I wanted to show you something
        - But, well, I talked to one student
        - This is called a sentence starter
        - I don't know if you can see it, but I'm going to read it to you anyway
        - Do you notice sentence starters, my friends
        - Sometimes sentence starters help us deepen our thinking
        - So can I read the sentence starter to you, is that okay
        - And then there's a line blank
        - So this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon
        - So this sentence starter says the scientists used
        - And this is where you're going to put the number
        - There's a number at the side of the paragraphs and I want to know exactly where you found your answer
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - I found my answer in paragraph blank
        - Okay, just try your best
        - I want my friends, I want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer
        - That's STUDENT that matters
        - So, well, I start with STUDENT
        - Um, you can do it on your own
        - And then after you after you do that today
        - And I want you to start working on the sentence starter
        - Do you need me to read that to you
        - Because that's important for readers to see because if the reader doesn't read the text and then they read their answer
        - They want to know that your answer is right and that you're telling the truth
        - So if you could fill out this sentence starter for me
        - I'm glad I'm so glad
        - Does that make sense to you
        - I want to know that you understood the reading that we did
        - But I want to know
        - But I was hoping that maybe we could work on adding a little bit more detail to your writing because someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is right
        - So your answer is right
        - But I think that if we add a little bit more detail and we describe is there may be an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use
        - That would be super helpful
        - So, STUDENT, if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name
        - But I'm a little bit concerned that you're not finding the answers in the text
        - See if or reviewed your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question
        - And while I'm doing that, I would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text
        - But what has already been discovered on the moon
        - I'm concerned about your tense because you kind of address, you said you need a scientific tool
        - So when I was reading that I thought you were talking to me
        - I'm a little bit concerned STUDENT
        - It didn't really restate the question
        - I'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer
        - So the way that you worded your answer
        - Yeah, so if you were to restate your answer
        - Or you could you say scientists
        - Could you maybe say instead of me
        - So how would you restate that question
        - Can you do that for me
        - I also want you to be more of a detective and look to see if there's any other equipment that you see
        - You take your time you reread it, see if you want to add anything, because I think there might be other pieces of equipment too
        - We kind of need both
        - So although I really love your answer
        - And it did teach me something I do want you to answer the question
        - Is that OK with you
        - So I want you to find your answer in the text because I want us to practice that skill
        - But I do want us to practice being that reading detective
        - Totally and and that's very helpful
        - You just said I circled the same as savannas I it doesn't help me know if you understand the question, or the answer really um
        - I am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could answer this question
        - In your own words
        - Can you be a detective right now, and maybe find that tool for me
        - I want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for that specific answer that you need
        - But I am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text
        - Do you want to try that
        - So I'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail
        - I was wondering, um, can you describe the machine at STUDENT
        - Like, is there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine
        - What, what does the machine
        - My next question was going to be
        - What does the machine do, could you add a little bit more detail into your answer
        - STUDENT, you just answered my next question
        - Yeah, you should you should make sure that you add as much detail as you can in your answer
        - So it's nice and specific, so I know exactly what you're talking about
        - I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right
        - So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words
        - It's really important to make sure that STUDENT of our answers come straight from the text
        - Can you go back and look to see if you see a specific equipment that's mentioned
        - If you're not sure what should I do you can do is go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name
        - Why don't you go back, decide if you think water is valuable, or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer
        - I'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly, but you provided evidence
        - It's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer
        - I'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and say why having more space on a spaceship is good
        - So why don't you go back and reread the text to see if there's any way that having more space would be good
        - It's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do
        - And that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion
        - And why can you tell me if this is good or bad, and why
        - I'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing
        - OK, so now please look at the question again, you are going to find out to look keywords STUDENT the most important words in a question before you answer it
        - So I think you STUDENT understand what I'm saying
        - Thank you for your response
        - I saw Jazmin and STUDENT not nodding their head
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question
        - Please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - Now you can use the words you circled "equipment" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there
        - But what made you say that, my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        - Yes, there are a lot of advantages, but except for equipment
        - Please read the question again do you have another key words like the action in the words in a sentence action word?
        - But my concern is, would you look carefully at the passage I think you have targeted the right place in the passage
        - You just need to be a little more specific
        - What kind of machine to discover water?
        - So you STUDENT just need to be a little more specific
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the key STUDENT important words in a question before you answer it
        - Okay, now, please read the question again, you are going to find out the keywords STUDENT the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question
        - Now I want you to pick up a pen or a pencil and I like you either to circle the words that you think are the most important in a question, the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question
        - Yes, the water is an overload along a passage
        - The key words like equipment do agree
        - But my concern is other students and they circle
        - And so um let equipment is an important words in a question, but you didn't include any equipment in your answer right
        - So, how will you revise your answer that include the equipment
        - I think in the middle the passage
        - And so you can look carefully in the passage to see where is the equipment
        - You can take a carefully look
        - But you need a little more specific
        - Right, so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles, because it's so small, but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they use to send to the moon
        - You just forgot to use the second part of that term
        - So I would have liked to see more information, more describing it
        - So although I agree with you that they might need oxygen tanks
        - But in the article, I didn't see anything about oxygen tanks
        - Our question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Right, so I would like to see you some context from the story to be able to answer that question
        - If you'd like to follow along with me
        - But if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks, but it does say in part number two
        - And I want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important
        - I'll give you a minute to do that
        - Okay, so I want you right now to reread the first or the article
        - Reread article, and I want you to circle, any word that you might think is equipment
        - My concern is, is that there's a better answer and a name for that small machine
        - Right, so you have the answer
        - It was more that we just need to build more on it
        - So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step
        - Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic
        - However, when we're answering questions related to a text we only need to provide the information from the text
        - Does that make sense to you?
        - If you provided that information that you just told me, STUDENT, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question
        - Can someone try to tell me what the key question what the key word is in that question that tells us what we're looking for
        - However, we missed a little part of the text in your answer
        - And I love that answer, because that's answering the question, we did need a piece that's the piece of equipment that needs to be used
        - So why don't we try to combine those two answers
        - So sometimes when we're answering a question, even if we think that there's only one part, we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit
        - We need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text
        - However, when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us
        - When we provide information from our own background knowledge
        - The issue with that is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information
        - So even though I might know that you visited NASA if somebody else was reading your response
        - And they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from right
        - To use evidence from the text in front of us
        - but we need both of those things to be looking at the water molecules
        - So it's just a matter of combining your two answers
        - That's right, to make a complete sentence, though, we usually we use the words already sorry we usually use the words from the question given to us right
        - If we use background information
        - So those are STUDENT pieces of equipment
        - However, when we're answering a question to a text that we've read, we need to be just using evidence from the text
        - The person who's reading your response
        - Don't know where you got that information right
        - You may question where you got that evidence
        - So if he was reading your response
        - However, maybe STUDENT doesn't know that
        - And if it's truly valid right
        - For example, I know that you went to NASA, because you've talked about it
        - So we need to be using the texts given when we're answering a question about the given tax
        - Tell me one key word one or more key words in the question
        - Can you tell me what they want you to understand
        - The scientists use in order to complete this mission
        - Let's revisit our text and figure out what specifically what equipment or scientific tool
        - So let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is
        - STUDENT right, it's not that your answer is wrong, particularly, it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically
        - So we want our answers to be as specific as possible
        - Yeah, we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences, but also pay attention to what the question is asking, and the context of the text
        - When does it do what is it, what does that tool used for? It's to find water on the moon, but how?
        - And let's be more specific, so if you look in that paragraph itself tells you exactly what it does
        - Yes, a specific name maybe right so let's look back at the text
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - What was the small machine called
        - So your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine, but I want to see more detail
        - I know that you could pull more detail from this
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and read for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer
        - What was this small machine called and what was it there to do
        - but I, what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the text and look for specifically a piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the reading and read closely the part where they talk about
        - So I want you to go back and try and find that machine
        - Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use
        - But what I want you to do is I want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon
        - Because at first I will read something and we'll think will think it's a big crater, because it is a big crater, but then we'll have to talk about our thoughts of it
        - Yeah, that's why sometimes we have to talk about our thoughts
        - And then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before, but this time we're going to do some close reading
        - And we're going to make some annotations on our work
        - So today, what would I want you to underline is where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer
        - So that means we're going to underline things that we find
        - I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water
        - And think about if there were any other tools that were used
        - I'm going to have you look at this paragraph again
        - What I'd like you to do, though, is look a little bit closer in the reading
        - I want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that shows what tools they use
        - So as you're reading and you're making those real world connections
        - So even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks, that's not specifically in the reading
        - So we want to find what it says in the reading
        - Yeah, so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question
        - Let's see what we can add to it to make it more complete
        - So now that you see where we got our answer
        - So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you
        - And then, as we're looking at Jazmin's answer to what do you think we could add to it
        - So I'm going to suggest that your STUDENT keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually
        - I'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer
        - Now that you've been able to add to your answer
        - So when you read your paragraph again I want you to think about what exactly this paragraph is talking about
        - Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different
        - For you STUDENT, what I want you to do is try again look at paragraph two, and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that
        - But the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water
        - If there were astronauts there, they would need oxygen
        - So I think we need to do a little bit more digging into the reading and maybe we can look and see if it shows says anywhere in our reading what equipment was used
        - STUDENT and look and see if you see anything about equipment
        - So maybe you could go back in the text
        - Well, your answer is not entirely wrong your answer was on track, but we're missing some of those details
        - So I think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text
        - But it doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water so STUDENT
        - That astronauts would need those masks and suits to do this
        - I really appreciate that point and you are correct
        - So we don't want to focus on what they would need, we're just focusing on what the machine needed
        - But there weren't any astronauts present
        - You can go back in the text
        - Why don't you take a quick minute and think about that
        - And let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were An equipment used to discover the water, let's take a minute because that is the question
        - So we want to make sure to understand the whole question
        - So we understand what they're asking us
        - You think that you would refer to the text
        - I think that's a great idea to help us expand upon our answer to add some details from the text to show that we truly understand what we're reading
        - I love that idea
        - And so just like I mentioned to Luis and STUDENT is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question
        - I think that's a great point, though, STUDENT is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us
        - When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question
        - And I love what you did with number two, but maybe you can do that with paragraph three, and maybe you can do it with paragraph one
        - Question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and we need to answer that question using the article
        - So then I would love for you to go back to one and two
        - Look for cluse within the text that have a ding ding ding And I give you a signal for a scientific tool
        - So reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment
        - And it's okay for you to circle some words that might help
        - You can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two,
        - And see if you can find more tools at the scientists use
        - And you can do that independently right now
        - So you can add that to your answer
        - And find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or I guess I can help you
        - So I want us to look at the action word in this sentence, who can give me the action word
        - So what's the action where what is one, one of the action words in this question
        - Yeah, you're exactly right
        - STUDENT, so I want us to go back and reread the text, and I want you to look for the action where discover because I think that that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so I'm going to give you a minute to go back into the text
        - Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer
        - Oh, STUDENT, you're absolutely right
        - The word discover isn't here
        - But I want you to look
        - Actually, I'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for a discover
        - And a word that might have a similar meaning
        - And so I'm going to have you look back in paragraph two,
        - I want to see if we can identify  This this different equipment, because none of us wrote this for our answer
        - There's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer
        - STUDENT your answer isn't wrong NASA did send a small machine but you um if you read on in that sentence
        - But friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question, we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us, STUDENT
        - So we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the key words
        - In our question before we write our answers
        - Does that make sense, STUDENT
        - So I want you to go back and reread And look for the word valuable, it can be really helpful friends when we pick out a certain word in our question and we try to go back into our reading and find it in order to find the right answer
        - So I want us to go back in the text and look for the word valuable because that's one of the words that's in our question
        - So I think the key to answering this question after looking at it and determining
        - That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource
        - So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability
        - So I want us to go back and into our reading and find more example
        - Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on
        - So I want us to go back into the text
        - I want us to look for examples explicitly stated examples in the text
        - I mean, when you answer a question
        - When I say is evidence from the text
        - I would like for you to use something that you have read in the story, or in the article to help support your answer and to help others who are reading understand how you got to answer
        - We want to be so explicit and explaining or so detailed in explaining what we're talking about that they understand
        - When we answer questions, it's helpful to think about if we were answering a question and someone who has no idea on what we're talking about
        - and we want to add evidence from the text to show how we got our answer to support our answer
        - That it's not, that's not the right answer
        - But when a question is asked  we want to make sure we're answering that question and connection to the text and we want to use evidence from the text to support our answer
        - And the question I would like for you to think, what is the most important parts Of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking
        - I would like for you STUDENT to think about that question
        - So What words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question
        - No one is here because they answer is wrong
        - We should be so specific that someone who has not read this text
        - But when we answer questions about an informational texts, we need to be very specific
        - They should be able to learn something
        - When they read our answer to the question, they should, they should be able to know what it is we're talking about
        - But can you tell me more about the machine
        - Can you be more specific, while using evidence from the text, something to support your answer
        - What type of machine was it
        - You was on to the right path of getting to the answer that NASA sent a small machine they did
        - So when you know what's being asked of you, you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer
        - Is very important to know what is being asked
        - So going back to the question
        - Yes, once again, that's also very important
        - But when we answer questions we need to make sure we answer on what's being asked of us
        - And that's good information
        - But before we start to answer this question, I would like to dissect it with you STUDENT and figure out what are they asking us what is it that we need to look for an order to answer the question, you can
        - I would like for us to break down the question and figure out what are they act in us, because once we figure out what's what their accent us we can figure out How to answer the question in what's the answer the question with Oh is it convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence
        - Yes, we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer
        - You want to use the text for our answers
        - We don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable
        - Evidence is important and what's another important piece of this sentence, and upon part of the sentence that we need in order to answer the question specifically
        - So you said evidence
        - Thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - And I'm looking for one more piece of the sentence
        - One more piece of the question
        - We don't want to talk about things
        - That's not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing
        - That's very true what you said
        - But as I said earlier, we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked
        - What are some strategies that we can practice before we even answer the question, what are some strategies that we can practice to make sure we are answering the question that's being asked
        - So when reading the question, what are some
        - STUDENT for helping him out
        - And why should we look at the most important parts, someone can raise their hand or STUDENT
        - When answering the question we want to look at important words they manage, do you have something else to say
        - That is very true
        - yeah I agree that you can do a lot with those too, so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence, but didn't explain why that's so valuable, so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals
        - You reread it, as is water on the moon valuable right now, but the question actually says, could it be valuable and that means at some point in the future
        - So my suggestion would be to find some reasons why, even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future
        - So you identify why water is valuable
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer doesn't isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that waters on the moon
        - So my suggestion would be to keep what you have, but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon
        - yeah, why is it in, because we know water is important here too, we need to just survive, why is it such a big deal that now water is found on the moon
        - So my My concern is that you, your answer is providing a good reason, but my suggestion, but still not complete, so my suggestion would be
        - To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little
        - But in another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the key words in our question so i'd like STUDENT five of you actually to
        - and i'd like you to circle, the key words in our question our action words, the most important words in our texts in our question here, and once you have a key word, you can raise your hand
        - Great guess that's definitely true, but I would like you STUDENT to reread paragraph two, and try to circle words equipment words that maybe that specific piece of equipment itself was what was used to discover the water okay
        - To what the scientists use
        - yeah it will be great if you look back to the second paragraph, so can you just look closely about this for up and I go back to you later
        - The in the question, the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so, can you tell me like what exactly equipment, the scientists to use I saw you just say a small machine, can you tell me the name of the machine
        - tell me what this question is asking, or what this question is asking you to do
        - yeah great yeah so, can you find those equipments NUTS scientists use it to discover water, not for brees back in the article for me
        - Let me know what this question is actually asking what what
        - In this way, that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so
        - The sentence that include these three keywords
        - This is the next step after they discovered water for the morn, hey, this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one
        - However, I think that this point doesn't answer directly
        - That's an important information and it's good to know what is a microscope, a microscope and but there is another equipment that they use in the beginning for this Discovery
        - But, you know, something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles and these titles and subtitles can give you more information about about the main ideas of the text
        - So can you tell me where the main words of this question?
        - But first of STUDENT, I want you to pay attention to this question, hey, pay attention to all the words in the details
        - You know, like we have to pay attention to another key word that is in the question
        - So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question?
        - We have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for
        - But remember, in order to have an answer
        - Okay, so what are the main words of this question
        - And pay attention to these question
        - I was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first, excuse me, the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that we can That you can use as evidence for this answer,
        - I'm concerned that that we need to find something a little bit more specific
        - I want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is, and circle that okay?
        - Since we're trying to use evidence from the reading to support it
        - Yeah, they definitely use a lot of equipment when we want to make sure that when we're answering the question we focus on what we see in the reading
        - So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon?
        - STUDENT take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is
        - Did STUDENT take a second to pre read the question and circle the most important part
        - I'm concerned that you don't that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water
        - How they would get to the water on the moon
        - So I want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence, you could find to Support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon, why it's so important to use STUDENT that time and effort and money to get to the water
        - Read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time
        - I like to answer their they're in the craters and we, the amount of water, however, like STUDENT said is microscopic
        - There's always extra information, we can find in different language that we could use To answer the question even better
        - I would just say that it's something that we can improve on
        - Well, I wouldn't say it's wrong
        - So that's a great observation, but to that, I would say we need to focus on the specific question that it's asking so it's asking us
        - But it's important to look at the language of the question and say, oh, is this the is this, am I looking for an oxygen tank
        - Is that going to help them find water?
        - So I'm going to give you STUDENT 20 seconds 30 seconds to think about it
        - And that word should be the one that will help you find the answer to the question
        - And then I'm going to ask someone to volunteer
        - So I want to ask all of you STUDENT take 20 seconds 30 seconds to think What word what one word jumps out to you when you read that question
        - Now you can raise your hand, but I will wait 15 seconds to let STUDENT think
        - And identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text, you can use that word to think about to help you answer the prompt or the question, if you have an answer ready for me
        - I'm going to give you STUDENT two minutes to read the text
        - Okay, so that's what I want you to think about when you go back into the text
        - Two minutes and read and just and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but I want a sentence for out of STUDENT for a revised answer
        - So for you, I would say, Read we read that part and see if you can add another like detail on to it
        - Maybe think about The equipment's looking for water, but maybe
        - Where's the water or maybe something to that effect, we can really make a more detailed answer
        - I would like you some of the tools that help us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information and our reading is to look at the question in this and figure out what is it asking us
        - So I'd like you to take a minute
        - What you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for
        - Take your take your pencil and circle
        - So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled
        - So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text
        - I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper
        - I see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but I'm a little concerned
        - That while the microscope is a tool, but it didn't really discover the water on the moon
        - So I suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again
        - Can you tell me that
        - So looking back at the question, what's the question that we're looking for
        - Are you able to tell me what the question is
        - But I'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text
        - And so even though that's an equipment, you're going to be looking for
        - STUDENT So Luis You talked about scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So that's a great detail that you found, but I think you need to look for a little bit more detail
        - So go back to the checks and look for that
        - Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used
        - I liked where the path that you were taking but I'm a little concerned that you need just a little bit more detail in your answer
        - Something else that links with that to help further your answer
        - So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle
        - So I want you to underline what you did answer, which was NASA sent a small machine so underlined small machine
        - A little bit more
        - And then I want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer
        - But I think I want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so read a little bit more, and maybe take some time to underline some key words in your Texts
        - You know there's actually very little water really on the moon
        - and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can
        - and wondering if we can get a little bit more specific
        - but i'm wondering if we can get a little bit more specific
        - i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific, so what were they sending the small machines for
        - I don't think your answers wrog STUDENT i'm just wondering if we can find a little bit more evidence for this small machine that you're saying that they send
        - Well, I think your answers right there right, so you said NASA send a small machine I would include the rest of that sentence in your answer, so what was that small machine called
        - awesome yeah I think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water
        - So i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - wondering if you STUDENT wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can use, we can find a more specific answer so
        - What equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon you STUDENT found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skip this step somewhere in there, so can you guys look back and tell me what you think
        - i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text
        - but I want to, we talked a little bit about um adding in those details so remember when I was talking to STUDENT about
        - STUDENT i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed
        - let's get a little bit deeper into that I think we can expand our answer a little bit um So yes
        - Okay STUDENT so in the text on do you um I so either i'm going to have you can you please read over the text, and try to find what that machine is called and then i'm going to if you have it right now
        - but it seemed like we weren't looking close enough in the text to really take
        - so when we have a question that tells us to use the text
        - So maybe not literally looking very close at the reading, but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to
        - is really instead of going straight to the text let's really know that we understand the question so before we turn that to the text  let's Can someone tell me exactly what the question is asking what is it asking us to find
        - Let's look back at paragraph two, to re review and see and you know, specifically how scientists got to the moon, to have that top soil to to analyze and
        - but my concern, though, is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon, is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth,
        - If we don't have a really solid understanding of what is being asked so with That said, what is the question asking us to find in the article that we read
        - you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts, and we are looking for equipment, specifically, and I would like, for STUDENT to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly
        - i'd like for STUDENT to write down say two things
        - So I recommend that you look back at the text to identify the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place, and can you can you answer what what that piece of equipment once
        - or a crater being full of water, the way that we might expect a lake to be full of water here on earth
        - I don't think they found the for like a big amount of just water liquid water, they found various little small thing that you cannot even seen with the human eye
        - How much water they had too so STUDENT you can go back and then look at how much water their own says they have found I think they say that okay
        - could you STUDENT look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph
        - I was wondering if you STUDENT could be any more specific with that
        - yeah so a really good way to think about that, when we're reading Our question is it says, did they used to discover water on the moon, and you can look
        - So looking for keywords like that
        - yeah that's absolutely right, I am not sure if, when we were when the scientists were using the Lunar orbiter to investigate if they had any
        - can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is I want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment
        - So i'm going to give you STUDENT about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question
        - STUDENT i'm wondering if you to take another look because i'm hearing about some really interesting tools from your classmates
        - That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the
        - But i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what are their information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission
        - but i'm worried that that's not the whole story, could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that?
        - i'm I was concerned at your response that that wasn't the whole story
        - yeah i'm worried if the response doesn't actually answer the question
        - i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case, so I would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question
        - but i'm concerned that that might not be the whole story
        - I would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery
        - i'm concerned that i'm hearing ideas from your
        - so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text
        - Alright STUDENT um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it, I want you to be a little more specific, so you told me that NASA sent a small machine which is absolutely true, can you tell me what that small machine was called?
        - Very good, there you go, we just want to be a little more specific there and then we are good to go
        - Which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text, I suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or NASA us to discover water
        - To the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used
        - But what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at NASA used a microscope right, and so what I suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what NASA and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water
        - What was the equipment that they use to find the water, so this answers the question the fact where they found the water, not what they use to find the water, so I just suggest kind of going back into the text, and looking at what equipment was used to find the water
        - Because some other classmates might not have that context right, and so this exercise is specifically what this article, says the scientists use
        - yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story
        - yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and
        - Right, do you think you could add that to your answer
        - yeah So how do you, do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon?
        - I think you could also talk about your own experience, going to NASA
        - Well, if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text, so you have this experience with NASA and learning about the equipment
        - So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering STUDENT this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place?
        - yeah so maybe you could include that
        - yeah maybe include that
        - yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why why we would need to look for water on the moon
        - Being an astronaut and you're, of course, they have to have oxygen tanks, so in this question or in this particular case, we want to try to use evidence from the text right so that's why I want to do I want you to take a second STUDENT
        - But we want to also find out how they find the water and circle, something that would let you know that okay
        - So what do you think I want you to dig a little bit deeper into the text, what do you think help them to get to the point where they could use the microscope
        - When you have the microscope there you're like okay Now I know exactly what i'm looking at right so, but we have to get to the moon
        - And then bring it in some right so again same direction as Farrah looking at text and see if you can find out how they were able to get it down narrowed the space down small enough to use the microscope STUDENT
        - yes ma'am I see your hand
        - I was saying that STUDENT else, I want you to dig a little bit deeper right right now we're in space we're looking for our water, so how can you be more specific in your answer when you say NASA sent a small machine how
        - I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific
        - But we want to figure out, we want to be as specific as possible, for example, when you go into your math STUDENT right and you say we use a lot of tools for math Okay, but you when you're trying to calculate you don't pull out your ruler right
        - hold on one second even and I noticed that STUDENT has to work on one specific thing, and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it
        - So what I like to do when i'm reading a scientific text is create a visual of what's going on, so I know that I have the moon, and have just told us that the moon has going to have a North Pole and a South pole
        - So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us
        - Okay, so I want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so, what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again
        - Great let's go back to our visualization
        - So maybe it's not in the text, but it was a brilliant comment, they do use oxygen tanks
        - But right now we're focusing on what we found in the text
        - So I think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine
        - Yes, oh, you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific, when we're answering these questions
        - But it was a great start, good job STUDENT
        - Um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response
        - And we also want to just make sure we're really using the text that we have in front of us to support our evidence
        - That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it
        - It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water
        - Okay, so remember we want to back up a little bit, we want to ground our answer in the text that we're reading
        - Yes, absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text
        - Oh that's actually really good that you know a lot about space, but one thing that I was going to say is that i'm noticing that some of our responses are not really pinpointing and answering the question that was asked of us
        - So what i'm noticing in Farrah's answer and some of our other answers, is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water On the moon
        - that particular tool, though, is not what found that microscopic water, okay?
        - I do not see the any paragraph the relative that related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really reasonable for addiction I don't see that answer here
        - You did you're so close, you told me what the machine is and basically you actually circle, the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer, however, you didn't tell me the name of the machine
        - The question was what equipment, the sciences using not is there and water, the moon, so, so I think next time STUDENT what you can do you can actually circle, the question statements
        - and give me the actual word with the citing source, then you will get the answer okay okay
        - My concern was in this responses that you didn't read the question correctly and he didn't read the question a little bit carefully, because the question your question that we asked you right now is that I want you to identify the object we're looking for and by by circling equipment
        - Here and underlined, a sentence where
        - and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon
        - So, right now, I want you to identify the object that we're looking for from the question by circling equipment
        - underline the last part the scientists us to discover water on the moon
        - You actually actually you did excellent job and catching that NASA send a small machine you're correct, however, you just didn't identify what the smallest shane was OK
        - But that you didn't go back to the reading and that's just my assumption I didn't i'm not saying that you didn't do it, but my assumption is that you didn't revisit the text and telling me what the actual machine was so
        - So what you can do my feedback for you is that you could just read every time you read a passage and the questions given to you, I want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me
        - On the machine oh that's Okay, next time, can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's STUDENT oh
        - So I think the most important thing is you already got the most important on the equipment we're going to underline the equipment
        - and underline to discover water, the moon right
        - So i'm here what were your what you wrote, I think you you've got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up on the way on the paragraph two and three,
        - But we wanted to use the text
        - They do, but this is asking us specifically from our reading, not from what we know from other places, in this text
        - The question though it did ask us, it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to be about astronauts,
        - yeah okay great and then go ahead and change your answer, if you think you need to okay and i'm going to move on to talk to um
        - But it's not the Big piece of equipment that we were looking for so, can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used
        - yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon, so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using STUDENT, did you have a follow up about that
        - At one point, I think you mentioned photos and I just want to be clear that a photo would not be enough, but like you said evidence would be enough, so any sort of a sample
        - what's what's missing from here what's the information that's missing here
        - You can do that too, you can kind of mix it in
        - Let me go ahead and take a look at your answer NASA send a small machine, so your answer is not wrong, I would just love it if you could explain it a little bit more and be a little bit more specific so
        - and see if there's a way that you can use it to help make your answer, more specific
        - can we look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was
        - But let's look at the question again let's see what is the key word and the question are using that's really important STUDENT look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two key words that you think the question that's important and the question
        - so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer
        - and maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable
        - i'm concerned that your response doesn't include STUDENT of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts
        - but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response, so you can see that you don't think it's valuable, but I would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think
        - yeah yeah look in the text and find find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable
        - You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money
        - Why you got there that you think, yes, it could be valuable and then some other supporting evidence for how
        - so maybe you STUDENT can go with the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic
        - so I would want STUDENT of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery
        - But my concern is that we still don't know its name and how it assisted in the discovery
        - We perhaps would be focusing a lot more on the text that has been given to us in order to come up with a specific response to that question
        - In this explorations, but we cannot perhaps you know, come up with a final answer unless we also look at the benefits of water on the moon
        - To reach a final conclusion about this, so I would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question
        - So what do you think the most important words in that question are? What words are kind of giving us clues as to the answer that they want?
        - What other words, do you think it's going to help us to figure out exactly what the question is asking
        - and I can see one other word in that question that gives us a clue as to, or is going to help us figure out what we're looking
        - right to look at really small things, but if we're trying to look at something on the moon right because the moon is huge and we're trying to find it
        - but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water
        - that's true that's true um What if you were to name that machine
        - But i'm wondering if so let's go back to that question again what equipment, so we want to make sure I answer has equipment discover water great
        - You know I i'm glad you caught the tool component, but i'm a little bit concerned that the i'm not sure that they would have the microscope with them, I think they're saying they wouldn't need it
        - Do you remember that part of the article I wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding
        - because we're gonna make sure answer touches not only discover water and lewd but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component
        - you STUDENT have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers, and I want you to make sure see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move
        - And I would say, I would add, try to be as specific as possible
        - But I want you to really make sure that you're looking to answer the specific question so STUDENT if you can go back to the text, and I want you to really look very carefully
        - would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon
        - Okay, and when you find it go ahead and just circle circle what you think that's speaking to that Okay, and then
        - But I wonder if we can go a little further, I want to see if we can build on your explanation, a little bit so a small machine, would you be able to know what that machine is called, would you happen to know that
        - At this point, we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and I love how, when you went back you're able to find The actual name of that small machine that they sent
        - so thank you STUDENT just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of them, the information that you found
        - What the text is saying, but it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds
        - If somehow you looked at STUDENT the answers and I don't I don't think that's the case, but I want to make sure you're doing your own thinking in the space
        - so STUDENT is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer, so that it paints a more fuller picture
        - So I think that would be a great idea STUDENT
        - Yes, I will describe it to you so in with this particular question in order to make sure it's fully answered you want to make sure you're one answering the specific question that's being asked
        - Okay, thank you for sharing that STUDENT now I would love for you to share with me, is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling?
        - I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer
        - Then STUDENT What about you can you go ahead and maybe tell us what's your what might be added to your response
        - But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text
        - Use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words
        - I really liked your response, because that is so true you did a great job on that response i'd like you to get a little bit more specific with that
        - Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me
        - Look for those little clues in the text in the question
        - So i'm going to go back and check in with STUDENT about what he's working on it, will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about
        - You know, did this small machine discover water on the moon, I need to know more about this small machine right
        - I definitely agree with you that the scientists are using oxygen tanks, but I really want us to answer this question with something that we found in the text
        - Of the strategy that we just did with Question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for
        - That there's water on the moon, but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters
        - On the dark side of the moon, the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it, would it would be something that you view with a microscope
        - when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right, but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it, it was the size
        - but they didn't they didn't send a microscope up to space okay
        - And you are, you are correct was certain extent, but we're going to be even more specific right they sent up a satellite
        - So in this particular experiment they didn't send that they didn't have people go up
        - Right, so if the question so sort of what we you know when you when you analyze things you read, we can look at specifically what the question is asking and
        - We look at the text that you have we want to see what equipment they talked about from the article so that may be true, on space exploration, that we do need
        - Like a treasure hunt right So what if you could take a second and circle, the words in the question that you'd be looking for STUDENT
        - To see what they see what they were looking for so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this the phrase that would help you make that connection between what the Lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph
        - yeah so that's a really great background information have but remember for this question, we need to circle evidence from our text so it's not in the text we can't use it this time it's still really good to know, though
        - yeah, a really good answer would say both
        - so this leads us into a good activity where I want you STUDENT to reread the prompt and I want you to circle, the most important word in the process so just take a minute and go ahead and do that
        - So just go back and read the passage really quick
        - So my suggestions are that you go back in the text, and you identify that specific piece of a quick
        - and you're right, it is small, and they do need a microscope but my concern is that your response, need the piece of equipment that made the initial discovery right,
        - about what exactly the question is asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question
        - Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay STUDENT do you have a question
        - All right back to the question at hand, STUDENT I want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for
        - But one thing I want you to focus on at that you as well, because you to have pretty similar answers I want you to focus on the key action word, so we have that word discover right
        - so go back to the text and see try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovering water on the moon
        - Fine yeah yeah so to find think about that general idea and see if you could find to go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover the not necessarily discover
        - cells to do that let's go ahead and look back at the first question, and what I want you to do this is like a really like he tip that would be super helpful and you could use later on to
        - So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it
        - So look back at the question and then I want you to read it and pick the most important word that will help us answer the question take 10 seconds and then we'll come back
        - Alright, so might be an option to look at right, but maybe I want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water amen
        - And then, for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon, to take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that
        - hi STUDENT with your response, I did say that you include a piece of equipment, but I think it could be more specific right, I think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about
        - Exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing
        - yep and then, of course, because we're amazing students, you want to make sure that the last thing we do is we always explain our why, and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that
        - Yes, pull out that one
        - I am wondering if we could get more specific STUDENT right so small machine, I can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this
        - Right, so can we get more specific, to help us have a better knowledge base here, do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific
        - Okay, great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right,so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle STUDENT and I think that would be a much clearer response
        - So what I want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three key words and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that okay let's start
        - yeah STUDENT I really appreciate that you have a strong interest in this film and I know from your answer that you're really an expert in this
        - But another really important part of his question is the action
        - And the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer, so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay
        - You should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right So could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text
        - Can STUDENT circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it
        - that's an awesome answer STUDENT, I think, maybe to make it a little bit more detailed, you can include the name of the small machine
        - That the scientists use to discover water on the moon, and in this case they're not using the oxygen tanks to discover the water they're using them to help them breathe so they're super important but they're not exactly answering the question right
        - Water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those key words and using that evidence from the text, can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely
        - So you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good
        - But i'm wondering if we can go even more specific right because this isn't just a tool that an artist uses this isn't just a marker, but this is what kind of marker? what color is this?
        - So we know that NASA sent a small machine, but what kind of small machine was it?
        - yeah so there's those are some details that you can use to describe things
        - I want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it
        - so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two
        - So if there's if we're looking for two equipments well what would it be
        - However, there was another machine you STUDENT that they also used
        - Yes, great, and that is really what I was looking for in this response you guys so many of you came so close um but I felt like every STUDENT your responses just needed that one extra detail okay um to really help
        - I could tell from your answer and I think that that is really helping you In Olivereloping your response
        - so go ahead and underline The specific detail, where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now
        - STUDENT I loved your answer
        - mm hmm you know I think you're right that scientists do use oxygen tanks, but I don't know that I see that in the text itself
        - Maybe because it's too expensive so they're sending these machines called lunar orbiter, so I think and not situation they're actually not using oxygen tanks, but that's a great point event yeah STUDENT
        - So you're partially right, because it is a small machine but there's lots of different small machines right like a small machine could even be a toaster so they definitely didn't send a toaster
        - So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question STUDENT
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about with your with your response is going back to the question
        - about the kind of equipment that scientists used, so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using
        - So you're totally right about that, but I want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your your answer doesn't totally answer the question
        - Because the question is about the equipment that science scientists use to discover water and then you're talking about the tool that scientists were using
        - To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question
        - And not discovery process, so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it, but finding it in the first place
        - I would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things, but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine, but the scientists were using
        - so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery
        - Is thinking specifically about how they discovered water on the moon
        - Looking specifically for that context that's a really great question STUDENT, thank you
        - But one thing that i'm concerned about is that your response doesn't directly
        - astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space, so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using
        - what's the important word in the question
        - However, I want to challenge you to not do the blah blah blah parts and to see if we can actually name we're looking for
        - i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today
        - Great yeah I think that's really solid, so I have my concern is that I would like to make sure that you are understanding what the question is asking
        - well remember earlier when I said I wanted to look at small details in the text when you said that originally it's not that always wrong it's just that I didn't know what they're looking closely with so
        - keep STUDENT should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so
        - Oh well, when I was looking at your answers and now as i'm talking to you STUDENT i'm noticing that when we're talking we're picking out some of the smaller details
        - And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use
        - to discover the water on the moon, I think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about
        - hmm, how do you think we can work a lunar orbiter into our answers? It says that they used it to investigate
        - But actually i'd like us STUDENT to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself Read over the question and maybe circle some key words or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that
        - but just to make sure that we're STUDENT on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text, but maybe in the future when we're going further, you can use all your NASA experience that'd be great
        - Alright, so, And I should have said this when you're reading but let's try to look for tools in this paragraph
        - And one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answered the question, what do you think about that, what are your thoughts
        - I want you to maybe take a minute, while I go speak to some of our other friends and see if you can look over the passage and see what equipment was mentioned in the passage
        - and i'm concerned that the responses that you STUDENT chose, which is a microscope isn't necessarily us to discover water on the moon
        - but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that I don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage
        - Alright, so I want you to think about that, while I go ahead and talk to my other friends and I want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage
        - Second, paragraph does talk about a small machine that NASA used, but I want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific
        - Alright, so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to
        - can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me, and maybe just two or three words, what is the question asking
        - Great that is completely correct and I want you to focus on two pieces of that question I want you to focus on that first word which is equipment and the second one, which is discover
        - STUDENT right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking
        - So, given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer, I want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking
        - response, so I want you that can you tell me, I know that in your answer you said you circle, the same as STUDENT but can you put the answer to the question in your own words
        - But I always think it's really nice when you include some background knowledge like STUDENT did so, if you did, that great if you didn't it's no big deal
        - Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing
        - um, so I think if we kind of bring STUDENT of these things together, we can get a more full answer
        - yeah let's take a look at that um I think if you STUDENT have your text in front of you, it might be a great time to take a look at Jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment
        - yeah great and so um I think of work to put STUDENT of these pieces together into a full answer
        - yeah absolutely, so I think if you put these two different pieces, together, we have a really complete answer
        - Okay, so what According to scientists use discover discover water on the moon so what's an important part of that question that we need to what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about
        - I would say, maybe let's elaborate a little bit and let's get some other perspectives, so does STUDENT else
        - But for now we're just looking at the evidence in the text right that we can use to answer the question, but that is great knowledge to have so if I need evidence in the text right, I might use
        - so you can follow that thread to the correct response
        - Can you read locate the text and find the Oliverice that leads you lead the scientists to the water, I think that would make more sense with this particular question, but I think you did
        - I think you're confusing this strategy with um just adding the name I guess
        - so I think you're on a good track, but if you look at the passage to you can um yeah find the word investigate
        - You have to be more specific than that in the in the answer to the response
        - Well, I believe you're right but um to answer this question, we will have to find the evidence in the text so we're not really thinking about
        - The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for
        - So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect
        - But the question here is based on the text that we just read
        - Okay, maybe we can look at the text a little bit more, I think I saw a little bit of a clue it's a small machine and we can find that in the text can STUDENT look and see if they can find that sentence of the text, a small machine
        - way to add a little bit more to it, yes
        - however, we can make our explanations even stronger by using more context from the problem
        - So we were looking for evidence in the text sure they might use that other equipment, but in the text it didn't have anything about that so it's just about being specific this time
        - So that's what they found by um we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon
        - And you were right with that you weren't wrong, but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail, instead of just saying small machine
        - Right, you need to feel a little more specific, so that they understand because I was looking at it and you said small machine, I might think the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small
        - But you want to base your answer off of the reading you don't want to go off on your own path, just in case it isn't right now, you might have thought it was one thing, but it's not actually what it is, so you want to face what you see in the reading and then put that into your answer
        - Yes, so just to make sure that you do go into more detail about what it is and that's really the only thing, so if you say that it's a small machine
        - I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is
        - Okay, so with that one, I just wanted to make sure that you understood that it wasn't full the critters weren't filled with water so
        - Okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters
        - So just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top, it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there, that there was water on the moon
        - You could yeah you could say that I would also make sure you say what's in the text, though, because the questions asking mainly what's in the text so just make sure you
        - If you know it's correct if if you're like unsure about it, I wouldn't but um
        - Harris, and you did a good job of finding you know what the machine does and the equipment that we're using and then STUDENT for recognizing that you know it's a small machine but we're still missing that key concept of what the action will have seen it right
        - So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question
        - STUDENT, you have a question?
        - cool so going back to our question like Luis said what are some key words or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question, what are we looking for, and the question does STUDENT know
        - Nice cool cool good good so with that you know what we're looking for with the equipment can we break that down a little bit more what are some words or some key words that we can relate to equipment that will help us find
        - So they can be types of tools, yes, you know equipment gear STUDENT those other things so but for right now, you know we're not primarily focused on you know the tool is used for oxygen and all those other things we're looking for the ones that will help us find the water right
        - But I think for this on packages, specifically, you know we're just looking at that one tool that they're using at this moment in time, so there definitely is a lot of more lot more equipment that NASA uses to find a lot of things, but
        - so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two, to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay
        - And i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found
        - So take a look at paragraph two, and see if you can find that tool
        - i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it
        - So my suggestion for both of you delve, too, is that you reread paragraph two, and maybe some of three and to really understand what tool is being used to first find the water before they use the microscope
        - so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two, there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works
        - Right, but if we really want to know how did they find it in the first place, there is another tool that we can look for in this in this New York Times passage there right and so actually for you and STUDENT
        - But we didn't specify exactly what that machine was
        - so let's take a look my suggestion, again, is that we take a look at this paragraph two, because there is there's another tool that was used in order to find the water, even before they could see it
        - i'm concerned, though, that there is evidence in paragraph four
        - um suggesting that water could be valuable, so my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph, for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason, maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful, even if it isn't right now
        - My suggestion is similar to Oliver and STUDENT you take a look at paragraph four, and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there
        - STUDENT You also spoke about paragraph five, so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find and why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship
        - Also right now Jazmin STUDENT reread paragraph four to find out why would it be better on the moon
        - yeah can you take a moment to add that into your response
        - So maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it
        - I am concerned, though, that the question is asking why are you would want water on the moon
        - Right and we haven't mentioned moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five, to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon
        - Exactly similar to STUDENT you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon
        - STUDENT perfect take a moment, you can add that in
        - i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water
        - so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention, in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there
        - So what i'm concerned about is that they also mention
        - Because most of the articles about equipment that they used how they found it, so I would reread and do a little ranking and sorting of the evidence that I find
        - So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use
        - I didn't say that your answer was wrong, I think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article, but I wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence
        - One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about
        - So you STUDENT took your answer from the first paragraph, but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article
        - So my suggestion To make your answer stronger is to keep reading and then check
        - So why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread
- intent: 500
  examples: |
        - Great job STUDENT, so how has your thinking changed, I want you to write in your reflection journal how has your thinking changed from when we started this activity
        - so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence
        - Absolutely that's great that is a great definition of what evidence is right when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do I see in this text or reading that help me answer this question
        - so we might look for cue words or leading words, like called, like you notice how called is before that, so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use
        - All right, um STUDENT, can you explain to me what evidence is
        - But when we're looking for evidence, we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us
        - Absolutely yep you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers
        - alright, so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation
        - We just needed to look more closely at our text
        - So I want you to think about what you can do differently next time when you're answering your next question to make sure you get the specific answer that we're looking for, because you guys were STUDENT really close
        - It can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for
        - Yes, so the next time you're reading a tough question
        - It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say
        - Okay, so whenever we're reading We want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question
        - So as we're reading, if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking
        - STUDENT So how's your thinking changed since the very beginning
        - What's another way you might answer that question
        - So can you see, um, you know, how we can approach that question a little differently now that you've kind of looked at it
        - So when you read something there's, it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question
        - More flow through this
        - The first time you scan it right
        - You just read it really fast, you know, just know, blah, blah, blah
        - Does that make sense
        - And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again
        - So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question
        - But again, when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put one and put them together to see what they're actually asking
        - Okay, so what can you do to to find the answer
        - You the strategy I talked about
        - Say, practice makes perfect
        - So if you want to be good at something, you keep john over and over and over
        - You can use that strategy over and over for the rest of your life
        - To STUDENT future questions in the text
        - How is that keyword discover changing what you were originally thinking
        - Can you go back to that
        - About our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking
        - We found a key what
        - What I want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question I want you to first think about your question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence
        - So remember when we looked at our question
        - You remember what I asked you to find
        - Keyword to help us and to answer the question
        - Did we need to answer this question
        - And what key word
        - So always find and identify a keyword
        - So you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text
        - She used the passage that we provided to find her answer
        - I like how Jazmin was able to tell me exactly where she found her answer and Chris and STUDENT that's more of what I would be looking for when you try to respond
        - Again, I like how she's very specific
        - She didn't just use her background knowledge, she made sure to go back and find something in the text
        - It will tell us what happened first and then what happens next
        - So often when we read it will tell us a sequence
        - So it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story
        - Because we want to we want to prove and even we're just reading, we want to use evidence to find evidence
        - Well, what I do agree
        - What can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people, but it's also good to know why we we think something
        - When we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are, the more sense that they make later on
        - So yeah, you were partially right you want to look for that name
        - So I think we've STUDENT kind of like learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume
        - We know we STUDENT know, different things about space, but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given
        - So when we're going to, and when we answer questions like this again, what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question
        - Well, we did think about it, but what did I ask you to do with your text with your paper
        - So we looked very closely at our text we looked for those key words
        - Did you find in the tip and not in the text, the question
        - Who thinks that they they can explain to STUDENT What what keywords
        - Alright, so let's look back at our question
        - But what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings, or your sub headings
        - So that's what you need to do want to read your question is to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer
        - Because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence
        - And then what happened
        - Maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text
        - You might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question
        - So if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened
        - And so that I can understand a little bit more because I do
        - And so I do like that you shared your opinion and next time when you share your opinion, just put it just how you told us
        - And then we said, Okay, this is, this is what that machine was
        - I appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific
        - So, so you built off your answer
        - Okay, so you're right, it's exactly correct
        - We narrowed down to that core of knowledge, we're looking for
        - And this is what it was doing
        - And much like with STUDENT earlier, we're just, we're trying to we're looking at that question
        - And we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components
        - That that is a, um, sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together
        - And it's called summarizing, so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer
        - So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence
        - So I really like to do is the race format
        - What equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon
        - I try to think to myself, I try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking
        - So for example, when I read
        - So for example, I might say, The equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank
        - And then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment
        - Where are we using yes STUDENT
        - But I think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific,
        - So next time you have a question, you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific,
        - So you can be give the best answer
        - So, that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords
        - See, sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer
        - Well, we just, you know, we kind of went back and we talked about what we thought our answer might be
        - Now that we've discussed it
        - So what kind of helped us find our answer
        - So now that you've figured out the full answer
        - What will you do next time to when you're looking back in the text
        - Go back and look in the story to find your answer
        - So now that we have talked about this, how has this changed your think
        - Yes, that is exactly what I would like
        - And that goes for everyone, not just STUDENT
        - So when you're answering these questions, try to use what you already know, as well as specific information from what we're reading
        - How did your thinking change there, what did you do differently
        - great job that's a good strategy finding Those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer
        - so next time with a question like this, how do you think you can make your answer better
        - OK, so now that I have given you STUDENT some feedback, I want you to think about how you started out thinking
        - Then, how that changed
        - And how you will apply what you learned in your next task so we're gonna go i'm gonna give you STUDENT a couple minutes to think about it, and then we will go around in the circle answering
        - So we can start with Farrah and just to repeat, I want you to stay, how you started out thinking, one second STUDENT, how you started out thinking and the strategy you use how it changed, based on the feedback I gave and what you will do next time to um What you are doing, next time, to make sure you are fully doing answering the question
        - What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question
        - we're just going to go around STUDENT, what do you think first you're going to stay what you want strategy you used how that has changed or how you will build on to it, for your next assignment or task
        - And last but not least, STUDENT What about you, what do you think how did you start off and what strategy, did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future
        - So why did you need to add more to your answer for to describe with lunar orbiter did
        - Of the name right so now I given you an example of what you need to add to your answer
        - Can you help me figure out the why
        - Is you told me before that what you did was you read you notice that the word water was in the question, so you scan through and you looked for things that related with water
        - So that was a really great response
        - So I really liked that response because you explain yourself really well
        - You said that you read the question you look you talk saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explain why
        - So now you're answering every part of the question you're answering what equipment they use you're telling me restating that they discovered water on the moon, so, can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning
        - So what would you with our discussion today, what would you say your answer would be, and how would it change
        - What or uses is kind of like a tool, maybe one of the tools that we use, because that is in the realm of our academic language that we're using
        - There is a part of that article that you haven't really heard before
        - So a lunar orbiter a microscope
        - So next time you answer a question like that
        - What I want to hear is the actual equipment they were using,
        - yeah I mean I definitely go to use your imagination, I really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions
        - STUDENT, has that change your thinking a little bit?
        - Right so next time you get a question on a text, are you going to use your background knowledge and not read at STUDENT, or you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge
        - Right that's good that's why we're in school right because we don't know everything I don't know everything so it's probably good, to use your use your text next time to write
        - Right, so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers, are STUDENT the way there yet
        - So what do you want to do next time um a teacher asks you a little bit more information
        - Right, so you went back and read
        - Yes, that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning
        - That was a perfect or smart
        - It was very specific
        - And she said, paragraph three, so we could STUDENT look at our texts and find where she was reading
        - We need to use those quotes from the text and I like that
        - And in our responses we want to use academic language
        - Alright so let's STUDENT think what did we learn about changing our answers today?
        - Do you see any ways does your mind kind of changing
        - Are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your STUDENT
        - It's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text, that's an excellent strategy that good readers to use
        - I like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you
        - It's very important to backup your answers with reasoning
        - and then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water
        - What's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this
        - I'm wondering what you'll do next time you had get a question like this to arrive that an answer like this
        - STUDENT, I'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking
        - I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook
        - And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future
        - You're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable
        - If you'll finish that it's okay to move to a question two and use the same strategy to find our keywords in question two okay
        - So STUDENT, you are using your background knowledge of a definition of Orbiter to be able to apply your answer
        - So when we're answering comprehension questions like this
        - We really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using STUDENT the information
        - So now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions, you can use Deb's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use STUDENT of the evidence from the text all the information there
        - I am going to give you some sentence starters and
        - This is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies
        - So next time we have, we're answering
        - Another question about certain text or maybe a different question about this particular text we know exactly what to do
        - So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response
        - And now I think this way because And then you can tell me
        - So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what
        - So this is, you think about the thinking and Thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question
        - So, reflect on that process what that was like
        - You started out thinking a certain way and now you think
        - So Farrah, and then you when you change your answer to what STUDENT also wrote, which is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay, so next time that you see a question like this, asked me about a text
        - What are you going to do that
        - She's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover the water and the moon
        - So we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process
        - I think it's the lunar orbiter because blank
        - So you can say something like, I started out thinking that we needed a microscope microscope was my answer for the question right now
        - Okay, so I have some sentence starters that can help you
        - And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy
        - You can use that type of same you're going to reference back to the text in order to find evidence
        - Can You Do you remember
        - Can you restate what their strategy is
        - Does STUDENT else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer
        - But now what they know is the right answer
        - Does STUDENT else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed
        - Does STUDENT else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading
        - So this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer
        - And you were able to find another part that you could add to it
        - Great that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords like microscopic so that's amazing
        - and I think that that's an excellent strategy for STUDENT to think about when we're reading a text is to think
        - Next time, that if you see this kind of question, so please just be more specific, as specific as you can to answer the question okay
        - yeah Chris it's great STUDENT right i'm so glad that you have so much background
        - Specific name and of the things that you described okay
        - When you're trying to answer this question is just to try to locate these key words in the paragraph and then find us as they're seeing the paragraph here just located
        - When we read, we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text
        - Um, so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer discussion question
        - We want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text, even though we might know a lot about the subject reading the text as our basis for discussion
        - So that's a great process
        - So that's great that's a great segue
        - So what I wanted to ask you STUDENT, next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said  And you analyze that and picked an answer, based off that specifically
        - or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these
        - Okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer, what do you think the difference is between those answers
        - Yes, so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future um I think that what you said about details, is very important, especially when we're asked a certain question
        - Yes, so that use the Lunar orbiter so STUDENT what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have
        - Okay STUDENT, and Oliver and Chris i'll get your questions in just a second um but Farrah,  and I just wanted to ask you um what made you change that answer for me to change
        - So when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important STUDENT, you have something to add
        - yeah so I want you STUDENT to think about and I want you guys to use this sentence frame, I want you to say I started thinking started out thinking Blank and then you can put your answer that you start you had at the beginning, and now I think  Blank So what do you guys think now that we know that water can be super useful for breathing and for drinking for astronauts and for rocket fuel and so net how that can help you for the future
        - And what about that, and when you STUDENT are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under, or about the moon, that we understand better now or water?
        - So I would love to hear from Oliver Oliver, what do you think what was something can you give me the sentence frame I gave you STUDENT just a bit ago I started out thinking, and now I think so now next time I can
        - are most important for you to focus on and are most important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is, is always helpful to circle key words in the question STUDENT, what do you think
        - Alright cool STUDENT so now looking back at our original responses what's one thing you think you would be able to change to make a response, a little bit more specific to what you read today
        - awesome so, how would that How would you need to revise your answer to include those two ideas
        - Okay, so i'm realizing I might have asked a specific question, because that answer sounds wonderful and you're definitely, including those two ideas in a passage i'm wondering how do you feel like that compares to your first answer what was different about those two
        - So what do you think you would do next time to
        - Okay, so what was different about that answer versus your first response?
        - What do you think from that you would stick with you for next time you're answering a similar question like this?
        - what about you? how did your answer change when you were able to revise it?
        - I mean you're 100% right and using that background knowledge, but when we answer questions, especially questions about a text, we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text so i'm
        - mm hmm so let's just think about as a team like What did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called? STUDENT
        - So, as we proceed with this discussion, I would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay
        - And moon, so I want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate STUDENT of those components
        - what I want to know is, if we added if we did a completely new question, would you be able to find it in the text so here i'm going to give you a new question if you need to write down the question go ahead and write down the question you ready?
        - OK so STUDENT do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking
        - Question one we can use the same concepts that we talked about right looking at the question to figure out what it's asking for, if we want to answer another question like question two
        - What i'm going to suggest to STUDENT of you, is when you start, the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question
        - so I guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking right and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading
        - How, what did you learn right What did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what What did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this person
        - That can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely, for the meaning of the the material before it
        - We need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers
        - STUDENT right, who's ready to start
        - yeah, so this is a really important skill for scientists
        - Great so STUDENT now that you're participating already Would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response
        - Did STUDENT else use that strategy, when they were going back to revise their answers
        - okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely
        - is there anything else did STUDENT do anything different when they were revising their answer
        - So we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies, the next time we come across a question like this, so
        - First you're going to answer I started out thinking blank then you're going to answer, and now I think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions
        - Great Okay, now that you have those answers the last part is so next time I see a question asking about a text, I will so go ahead and finish that thinking routine
        - yeah so does what made you change your thinking on that
        - I love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique
        - that's good yeah the thing about the thing about reading for keywords and sometimes authors will use synonyms so two words that mean the same thing, so when we're thinking about discovery definitely found or
        - And then, after you're finished i'm curious if you could share, about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote
        - mm hmm and has your thinking changed at STUDENT about how they found it
        - So, in terms of finding the Lunar orbiter because, first we just talked about equipment and then we just talked about a small machine, so I suggest that the next time you read through some material, you can look for those key specific words that might help you have more rounded out answers
        - Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise
        - yeah I think that sounds great I think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times
        - Do you want to fill fill out the the the final thinking routine, for me, I used to think
        - What was different about your first answer and your second you said
        - yeah so Okay, so I sort of noticed that, through talking with STUDENT I mean that you also added some specificity to your answer, do you think that helped you get a more full response
        - Okay, what could you do next time
        - What do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking
        - Okay, so you knew it, but you maybe had just forgotten it and so that's pretty simple So what do you think that for next time, if you could set yourself up, I think you did it really great here, where you just sort of said
        - I think that's totally a great strategy for you, I think, if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go
        - So how can I ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer what was what was different and how other than just writing more, what do you think your thought process was in shifting your answer
        - How can you know, to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking, so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down
        - How how you're thinking about the asking a question sorry i'm stumbling over my words so maybe you can start with saying I started to think
        - Fantastic so I really appreciate coming STUDENT just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here
        - The question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence, but I wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response
        - Thank you okay so STUDENT do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions
        - Whatever you think it's Okay, if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you STUDENT are thinking so take a moment before our conversation I thought this after our conversation I thought this
        - Before our conversation I thought that the answer was This or I didn't know the answer, or I was still confused, but just before our conversation, this is what I thought, and then, after the conversation that we just had now, I think
        - I think it's Nice, though, when we read a text, if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment, then that way when we write our answers out If I ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text
        - so I think STUDENT you did just that, when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two
        - has our thinking kind of changed at all, since we started talking through this STUDENT sorry I saw your hand was up
        - Oh yeah, then you should probably read the text more closely before answering a question
        - yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy, you can use in response questions
        - Hi Welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it i'm STUDENT as as we talked about earlier in the day, you can use specify specifying techniques in your responses, maybe in the future, yes, Ehtan
        - Well, in this case, adding a name would be sufficient, but I i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses, instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so
        - But your strategy is absolutely right, you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text,
        - So actually we can find some information in the following sentences like, and here we found that there is sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and
        - So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text
