        - that's awesome that's awesome before we get started, I want to ask, if you guys can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so I don't like to say boys and girls and I don't like to say you guys, so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the JET eyes the eagles the ketchup packets, what can I call you as a group 
        -  Has he told you about these kind of thing
        - Oh, that is so awesome
        -  When you deposit something, how much do, what do you deposit? Do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces?
        - Okay
        - Well, when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  So have you all  you seen frost in the wintertime or in the fall?
        - Yeah
        - Have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass?
        - What, what is he doing when he's investigating crimes
        -  Does he does, he just leave them unsolved at the end
        - Could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general, while they were in space?
        - Have you ever seen something through a microscope
        - Yes, what thing that you see
        - That's really good
        -  Well, it sounds exciting
        -  Did you enjoy yourself and NASA?
        - OK
        -  That is a lot of good information
        -  Does anybody else have anything to say about that? Any input on what you think about space?
        - OK
        -  Why would-- why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks?
        - How about STUDENT? Can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what Chris and Luis is telling us?
        -  Because if our atmosphere, which is the air that we breathe, which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space, if that is messed up, then we won't have any air here on Earth, so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live
        - That is a good point
        -  How about you, STUDENT? Do you have anything to input?
        - OK
        -  How about you, STUDENT? Do you have any input to go with the group?
        -  A lot of people aren't into space
        -  Some people are into the oceans and stuff, which is very interesting too to learn about
        -  Well, that's OK
        -  Some people are more into the environment, like STUDENT was talking about
        -  Is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story?
        - OK
        - Oh, LAUGHS
        -  They had to wind on the wall
        - Yes, they didn't have phones back then, the cell phones, like this
        -  They didn't have anything like that
        - GASPS
        - And there was cartoons and books about phones
        -  But do we have it today?
        - And people thought that was just going to be-- that was science fiction, and that was not realistic
        -  Like have you seen the latest results and stuff from Titan, the moon on Saturn?
        - Right, right
        -  And it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space, which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations
        -  And there's actually a moon that's called Titan
        - Yes
        -  Saturn has a lot of moons that are floating around it
        -  And they think that they may have found life on it
        - GASPS
        -  So it's really cold there
        - Well, they're microscopic aliens that live in the very, very cold, because it's really, really cold on the moon
        -  On that moon, it's like 200 below zero
        -  But they think that with their equipment, like what they had on the moon that was-- that they used to find the water on the moon, they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on Titan
        - Yes
        -  That's pretty good stuff
        -  What do you think about that, AUDIO OUT]? You know, there and outer space and stuff
        -  Yes
        - Yes
        -  Yes, and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using, with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there
        - OK? Do you have anything else? Do you have any interest in that, STUDENT, about the aliens on the moon of Saturn?
        -  Which that is very good that you said
        - Your answer wasn't wrong
        -  You were talking about the atmosphere, which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from Earth
        - They would have to make a-- what would they need in order to be able to do a really good garden on the moon?
        - So they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that, possibly, maybe
        - How did everybody like the reading
        - You like the martian?
        - Yeah, it's a good movie
        - So where did they find the water?
        - In polar crater
        -  So what does that mean, is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom
        - Well science videos, my family
        -  We love to watch science videos and documentaries and those are great places to learn
        - And it's a great place to learn more about what we're talking about,
        -  Um like a refrigerator
        - Kind of how I think about it
        - If somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator, you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power
        - Well, fun fact, when I was in first grade
        -  I wanted to be an astronaut
        -  But, you know, that was my goal
        -  So obviously I didn't live up to that
        -  Kennedy center, or--
        - Did you go to the one in Texas or Florida? Did you go to the John F
        -  Was it fun?
        - Oh, so I think that's the one named after president Kennedy
        -  I'm gonna go back to STUDENT because I'm pretty excited that his dad is a astronauts
        - Is a while you're looking at it
        - but does that mean you know everything about what scientists using in space? How does an oxygen tank work?
        - Has anyone ever use a microscope before?
        - So what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions?
        -  Invite me
        - To the next time
        -  What do you say,
        - How do you convince people that you're the best at Minecraft
        -  Right
        - Well, you actually show them by beating them in the game
        -  So you're using actions, instead of words to convince them
        - Do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at
        - Well that's that's unfortunate, but does he, uh, are you able to speak to him on a regular basis, perhaps, or some online activity or is hearing stories
        -  You're sitting there were at school
        - All right, because we're looking at what equipment is just like today, sitting in front of you, okay
        - Now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know
        -  So what's an equipment you have right now
        -  Thats helping you with your work, STUDENT
        -  But right now, you every one of your student at school, right
        - And I'm glad you brought that up too about NASA because you know what today when we're learning you're having to use the tablets
        -  Now, just like when they did their research
        - You may have a pencil in front of you, but things are changing
        - So did you enjoy reading the passage
        -  I don't want you to write down what all you know about space
        -  Okay
        - I want each one of you to get a little piece of paper
        -  I want you to share with a partner, but I'm gonna have the first group, we're going to let STUDENT, Oliver and Chris, you get, you three work together and let Jazmin and Luis work and share what you know about space
        -  Okay, with each other, quietly okay so y'all can turn to each other and show each other what you know about space
        - Alright, so let's go over
        -  It's really small, what's something that we could use
        - Okay, what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close
        - Yeah, like a magnifying glass
        -  How many of you have ever seen a microscope
        - All right, so STUDENT
        -  Where did you see a microscope at
        -  What do you want me to tell me about space STUDENT?
        -  Good
        - Oh you already know a lot about space
        - You are correct
        -  When I was younger, two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment
        -  I went to NASA as well
        - I had a great time there as well
        -  Did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad
        - The question asked about the equipment, but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert
        -  Did anyone else know that the moon is like a desert
        -  It seems like you learned something today
        - Oh, well, that's great
        - Isn't
        -  Tell me what you know about space
        - There's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others
        -  But if you read it
        -  Where do you read it up
        - Like a, I don't know if it's necessarily possible
        -  That's super cool
        -  Anything could happen
        -  Yes
        -  Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if next year, they did something crazy with everything happening
        -  So I mean, at this point in time and this year
        - Possibly
        -  So give me some examples of tools
        -  Debbie had your hand raised
        -  Can you give me an example of a tool
        - A tool
        -  Is there anybody else that wanted to share a tool
        -  That's absolutely right
        - Yeah, absolutely
        -  What does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip
        -  So if you drive very far
        -  You are right, think about like a gas station
        - They wouldn't get stranded
        -  And you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station
        - You won't run out of gas
        -  And it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station
        -  We're not gonna turn back around, right
        - We'll just get more gas and keep going
        - Do you?
        -  Easy, two plus two is four, maybe I actually wouldn't
        - I know at least growing up I was not always the most confident when I came to answering questions, even if I knew you know I knew the answer
        - Answer out of fear of ridicule from my friends or even the teacher
        - So like an ant
        - Can I look at something that's smaller than and because I didn't see an am with my eyes
        - Oh, like organisms
        - Oh, who knows what the periodic element is for oxygen
        - So on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen, water is H two O Mr STUDENTon
        -  We were talking about the elements and water in the element periodic table is H2O
        - Okay, so where we left off
        - Yes
        -  Do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope
        -  Yes, you do
        - what are the oxygen tanks usually designed for? Anybody know?
        - Do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not
        - that's really cool fact STUDENT, where did you read that
        - Okay, what about equipment that's not talked about in the text,
        - How did they get to the moon
        -  Well, since you've gone there
        -  Um, could you think of like two things that that you saw there
        - Awesome
        -  That that's really cool
        -  Yeah
        -  I am I am I have been for the military or they both might use it but I saw something like that
        -  That's really cool
        - Yeah, I think I saw something with eggs or something
        - Does everybody here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Is there anymore knowledge you guys have
        - You went to NASA? Really?
        - Yeah, has anyone else seen anything from NASA, you can reach
        - so STUDENT has as well
        -  Yeah, yeah
        - would anyone ever want to go to space
        - And experience this
        - STUDENT
        -  What about you, would you want to or would you not
        - The water is hiding in the craters
        - Maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time
        - So you like to read
        -  Do you like to garden yourself STUDENT
        - That's, I love that answer
        - You know all about space really where did you learn about space
        -  Was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum
        - Person
        -  Do you want to be an astronaut when you're older
        -  You are so passionate about space
        -  How is everyone doing please raise your hand
        - Good afternoon, everyone
        - Oh, thank you, STUDENT
        -  STUDENT
        -  Would anybody else like to tell us about their day before we move forward
        - That's pretty amazing
        -  STUDENT I wonder if your dad has ever seen the lunar escape or the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So can you tell me what what do you know about space
        - Okay, well, maybe, I don't know
        - I would love to go, I wonder, I hope that they're selling tickets soon to the moon base
        - STUDENT
        -  Go ahead
        -  I like that shirt I have the same shirt
        -  Actually, that's a really cool shirt
        -  I think we all see the moon as something far away and we hear certain things about it and we see pictures, you know, the big round objects with the craters
        - I agree
        - But we never think about how it would be to actually exist
        -  There are walk around on the moon
        -  So I agree with you
        -  I think that's a really cool thing
        - Were you surprised STUDENT, that the scientists found water on the moon
        -  I think that's what the scientists thought too
        - Yeah, me either
        - how about you, STUDENT
        -  Were you surprised
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  Were you surprised
        -  That's a really good reason to be reading current news
        -  That's it
        - Yeah, so those are this article made you think about something new
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  So the fact that there's water on it is really intriguing for me
        -  I really liked space and I like seeing the moon way up there at night
        -  Me too
        - Yeah
        -  I thought this was great
        -  Me too
        - So, you know, there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there
        -  STUDENT or someone who's experienced about space, wasn't there a lot of information about in the article
        - So STUDENT did you did you like reading over this paragraph, or you know, did you find it interesting or any thoughts
        - yeah and STUDENT like was this the spark any interest in you or yes
        - that's more of like I know you mean i've been in i've been in like a crater like swimming as well, but that's different than on
        - awesome thanks STUDENT okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses, I wanted to know just by raise of hands, who would love to go to the moon someday
        - STUDENT, why do you want to go to the moon
        - Absolutely me too, so you know some of you didn't raise your hand, so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon, if anyone wants to share
        - so let's let's kind of unpack lunar orbiter for a minute for a minute there does anyone have by chance in this group speak Spanish by raise of hands anyone
        - Each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in French, do you know
        - yeah so in Spanish it's Luna
        - Yes, that is you're absolutely right and and why STUDENT, do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon, for that matter
        - Do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact
        - yeah STUDENT Do you know anything else about the moon
        - What about anybody else does anybody else in our group know anything specific about the moon, that we didn't read in our activity
        - No way STUDENT that's so cool would you guys like to go to the moon
        - Alright, so first I was wondering what did everyone think about the passage that we read about water on the moon Is anyone have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see STUDENT
        - that's amazing I really hope that you can Maybe you can be an astronaut, one day, and actually get to go on the moon, that would be amazing to know that what am I students got to visit the moon, that would be incredible
        - what's your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - Would any of you guys be excited to live on the moon, if you could?
        - STUDENT, what do you think? Would you want to live on the moon?
        - Oh, what kind of stuff did you see
        - Since you went there and did it make you want to join NASA and go to the moon
        - Right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon, and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet, do you think you could work that into your answer
        - Oh, what do you know about space
        - STUDENT could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere
        - Well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon, so that you might not die?
        - How do you think you would do if you were on the moon?
        - Before we begin, I have a question, do you speak Spanish
        - STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Okay STUDENT do you speak Spanish
        - Great STUDENT can you teach us the Spanish word for moon
        - STUDENT have you been to a really dry place could you tell us about that?
        - Is space something you're interested in STUDENT?
        - and STUDENT one last thing what was Armstrong Neil Armstrong What did he say when he landed on the moon
        - Well that's fantastic, can you tell me something you know about space
        - Okay, have you ever used a microscope
        - When you guys were reading this, how did it feel, did it feel really easy, kind of in the middle or really difficult to read
        - Do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other, in a small group
        - um, but I would have loved and maybe it's in a separate article, you know if they would have talked about kind of the space suits and the way that that they do provide I think they call it
        - But i've seen lots of videos where they use lots of different equipment, like the ones you described and they have to use like space suits and sometimes these satellites to see different things- it's very interesting
        - buttons and things to control things that are in space, because we can't be in space all the time, so they use them to control telescopes satellites like I said, to see what other things are going on yeah STUDENT do you have something to add?
        - Okay, I think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it, what is your favorite thing about space STUDENT
        - yeah that's really cool I I think it's really interesting also and such a cool advancement in technology so let's let's talk about the question that you guys responded to which was
        - that's that's really cool i've never been to NASA, but I think that would be a really fun trip What was your favorite part
        - Really so let's begin with you, then, what do you know about space
        - Did you guys like the reading about the water on the moon, what did you think about it?
        - Do you, what do you, what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us?
        - I know I kind of feel bad for Pluto don't you?
        - Okay, great alright, so how about the rest of us, what was the most interesting part of the reading that you guys read?
        - Alright, do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon?
        - I know
        -  Do any of you think you would like to one day live on the moon? What do you think?
        - i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's Friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration, which used to be my favorite topic when I was your age yeah STUDENT
        - You know the thing that stuck out at me when I think about space room, I remember when I was your age was thoses gold helmets you remember those
        - This is it really is one of my favorite topics, especially when I was your age
        - yeah that's great, in fact, those things, I think, if I remember right they were like 200 pounds or something, but you don't feel it when you're bouncing around on the moon right because the gravity is different
        - Oh does anybody know what is water, made up of what types of molecules of water, made up of anybody know
        - um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know
        - yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like
        - Really STUDENT some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet, that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use
        - Oh that's cool STUDENT what about you Where would you go what planning, would you
        - and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o
        - Okay, so they had they found that hmm there's there's some H two of those there's hydrogen up there, and maybe it's part of water h2o and that would be exciting right, because if there's water, you know that
        - Right you all drink water every day right
        - So maybe in your site, yes, water is a big part of who you are okay
        - Know do you just like to read about this on your own
        - do you like like space, do you like to
        - no washing machine, but I mean I don't know how they wash their clothes, but that that would be a different different text right
        - So could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting?
        - wow
        - Do you think they would, how do you think data or no sorry STUDENT, how do you think that the NASA scientists could use the Lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon
        - yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon
        - that's going to be possible, and what year was it 2024
        - Based on our reading
        - i'm STUDENT do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon?
        - Oh yeah we might want, we might want to experiment with that STUDENT what were you gonna say
        - i'm not sure if you guys saw it from NASA where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon, and if
        - I know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or
        - And I think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh
        - He did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting, what do you think
        - Who can you tell me, one thing that you know about space
        -  STUDENT knows this, correct
        - This is all true
        - jas STUDENT you're not so interested in going to the moon
        - I like that answer what How would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that
        -  STUDENT, why are you interested in going to the moon
        - Those are really beautiful ideas, thank you for sharing STUDENT
        - Oh wow that's really interesting, are you really passionate about space
        - That seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration Maybe you can after we have our small group discussion tell us some interesting facts
        - Oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures, maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day
        - I definitely feel you there my parents used to take a lot of pictures whenever we went anywhere, when I was a kid so I can definitely relate to that embarrassment
        - yeah absolutely I agree with you, and you know what you just said STUDENT made me think a little bit about like there's deposits of minerals and oil underneath the earth's surface and so
        - but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that STUDENT
        - well you could be
        - Fantastic, how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space
        - really like space i'm also big fan of space to
        - Do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned
        - They they were Yes, that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the
        - yeah isn't that cool
- intent: r110
  examples: |
        - that's awesome if you're, then you can help us figure out these couple questions so we're so glad to have you in this group, and you can you can kind of help us to follow the prompts of the, the question that we were that we were answering so i'm so glad you're here all right
        - And STUDENT I think you said this, did you say the same thing is that right.
        - hi STUDENT I see you've got your hand. we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to Farrah and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that OK OK, I put a pin you i'll come back to you
        - that's right you totally did and NASA did send a small machine
        - nailed it yes STUDENT high five hashtag awesome lunar orbiter is the name of the machine great
        - Totally You got it
        - You nailed it they absolutely do they use so much equipment in science and NASA and they get to play with like lasers all day and I am jealous of them, yes thumbs up
        - I love that you know you have so much prior knowledge about space yeah I appreciate that i'm you know I think you'll bring a lot to whatever group that you're in
        - i'm glad i'm glad to hear that I think you will have a lot to contribute with your knowledge
        - yeah awesome so you identify and equipment
        - Your answer is not around, I think that there are multiple answers here right so we've identified one equipment you actually
        - Yes, ice and ice deposits, yes STUDENT
        - yeah I did I am so happy to hear that you already know so much about or like you went to NASA that's really awesome i've always wanted to go check out like nasa's and facilities and museums and I think you and STUDENT probably have a lot to talk about feed both share the interest in space, thank you for sharing
        - Oh good, well, that means that you can help us, I think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this group STUDENT
        - Yes, good the investigation part is good, let me look at the question again
        - Nice yeah they do use a lot of equipment yeah
        - All right, i'll let you think about that question, while I work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay
        - yeah that's a great answer STUDENT
        - STUDENT can I have just a second
        - yeah they do STUDENT
        - Well i'm really glad that you feel like you have a good understanding of space, but we're just gonna we're just gonna talk really about that answer real quick i'm excited to hear what you have to share though at the at the end, whenever we get to your turn
        - yeah that'd be that'd be that'd be a great thing a lot of times you might look for keywords
        - Well that's The great thing this answer has multiple answers and sometimes you want to circle, as many as you can
        - Absolutely
        - um i'm glad you're really excited to learn about space um STUDENT
        - Absolutely, what about you STUDENT
        -  STUDENT, what about you
        - Absolutely
        -  Okay
        - Well, I completely understand that and I can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so I can tell that you do know a lot about space, but I just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question
        - Equipment is a great word
        -  Did anybody else put equipment
        -  So that is a great word to underline, did anybody else underline anything else
        - Okay, awesome
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Okay, good
        -  So we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good
        -  Those are both very important
        -  So a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called?
        - Good
        -  That is exactly right
        -  And they're saying that they're using the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Exactly
        - Discover, that's great
        - That's great
        -  So guys, I want you to think
        -  That's absolutely right
        -  So we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So good
        - Yeah, exactly
        - Right, you use it to look at the water
        - That's really cool
        -  But let's get back on topic
        - Um, well, you're right
        - I didn't say it was wrong
        - Yes
        - Yeah, yeah, they do, but we were just discussing this question
        - You're all right
        -  It is, I didn't say it was wrong
        - It is
        - Right
        -  Once they found it
        - STUDENT, you talked about a specific tool, a microscope
        - That's cool
        - The only person STUDENT is the only person that said yes, that it was valuable and kind of told why she thought it was valuable
        - That would be really cool
        -  A, then, what were you gonna say
        - Right
        - Yeah
        - You did some great reading STUDENT
        -  It was called the Lunar Orbiter
        -  They did send a small machine
        - Okay, STUDENT, Jazmin, you put NASA sent a small machine
        -  Yes, they did
        -  Okay
        - Let's just hang out for a minute
        -  Let's talk about some things
        - Exactly, yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Okay hold on just a moment
        -  Okay
        - Yes, it does
        -  You two are correct
        -  It is the Lunar Orbiter
        -  So you are right there
        -  And I'm but yes you are
        - Yes, and STUDENT
        - Well, that would be awesome
        -  I didn't know that you taught me something
        - Yes, they did
        -  So I'm glad you're here with us
        - You don't think you should be in this group
        -  Well, I'm glad you're in this group because maybe you can help us all out with some of our questions we have and how we answered
        -  So STUDENT Can you help me understand
        - I really like the fact that you have a lot of knowledge about it because it tells me that you're probably really interested in space
        -  He told us that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Also STUDENT's answer
        - All right, thank you for your answers
        - Well you know what, because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you
        - That's okay
        - It is
        - Well, that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know
        -  Um, we definitely need oxygen
        - Okay
        -  When we go to space, don't we, because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here
        - Yeah
        - Your, your answer is not wrong
        - You need a microscope to be able
        - To see it
        - You're right, you're right
        - Your right
        - I appreciate you guys coming in today you've all done a very good job
        -  Okay
        - Even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where, you know, in a little bit more, maybe you can teach us some things along the way
        - So someone says, use a lot of
        - Equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay
        - Very good
        -  And that question and you answered it
        -  So you guys did really good writing down an answer
        - OK
        -  OK
        -  I'm very proud that you tried and read the pair the paragraph
        - That's great
        -  You could if there's enough water
        - That is true
        -  Okay
        - Good
        - You know all about space?
        - STUDENT, that is such awesome information and I'm so proud of you, that you go out and look for that information on your free time, and I can't wait to share all of that information with the rest of the class when we get back with them
        -  Oh, nice
        -  Thumbs up
        -  I love that you know about oxygen
        -  That's awesome
        - For right now, I love that you know that there's oxygen tanks
        - Well, STUDENT, don't think that your answer is wrong, sweetheart
        - All right, well, that's awesome
        - So, in paragraph one, it does tell us, scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters
        - I'm sure they do and I bet that STUDENT could probably tell you more and you can share that information together
        - Your answer is not wrong, honey, you're, you're right
        - STUDENT, then you'll be able to help us as we as we explore a little bit more about what we what we've read about
        - Scientists found craters full of water on the moon, you are absolutely correct
        -  So I know that you can really help us out here
        - And I know that you know a lot about space
        - And that's awesome, and I love that you know that because it's very, very helpful and necessary for all those astronauts up there
        - STUDENT I want to go back to your answer
        -  You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        -  And that is very, very true,
        - So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water,
        - You need a scientific tool to look really closely and that's exactly what STUDENT had said
        - You're okay
        -  Thanks, STUDENT
        -  So do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better
        - You do
        -  That's wonderful
        -  Does that sound okay
        -  Well, maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently
        - Wonderful
        -  I'm so glad you're ready to help
        -  Yes, there is a lot of equipment that gets used
        - You're right
        - Nice
        -  Yes, that was really interesting
        - Wonderful how
        -  What a fun experience
        -  I love that
        -  What a good observation
        - Yeah
        -  That is really cool
        - Wow
        -  I love all of those answers
        - Yeah, that was a big question
        - Right
        -  That's a really good observation
        -  I love that
        - Okay, I like that answer a lot and STUDENT, would you like to add anything to that
        -  That's very true
        -  STUDENT, what would you like to add
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        - Just those two pieces of equipment
        -  Okay, wonderful
        - Oh, let's wait your turn, please
        - I like the connection you made there
        -  All right
        - Something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense?
        - Gotcha
        -   You're doing a great job of listening
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for clarifying that
        - STUDENT
        -  I'm so glad that you could clarify
        -  That's great
        -  Thank you
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        - Okay, let me let me talk with STUDENT for just a moment and I'll come back to you
        -  That's a great connection
        -  How neat that you've been to NASA before I love that
        - Yeah, that's great
        - That's right
        -  So you weren't wrong at all
        - They would probably need a microscope, if they're going to test the water
        - You're absolutely right
        - Orbiter
        -  They said, a small machine and you're exactly right here
        -  Good job
        -  So you said
        -  Okay
        - Right
        - I don't
        -  Your answer isn't wrong
        - You guys said they use the scientific tool called a microscope, which that's answering the question
        -  Right?
        - Mm hmm
        -  Is that what you put
        - I have written, I have that you put scientist, use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - Okay, while are you looking for
        -  I'm going to talk with the other four
        -  OK
        - I'm really proud of you guys for answering the question, and reading the passage and answering the questions
        - STUDENT, you put the same thing I Farrah
        -  Correct
        - So I'm STUDENT
        -  What I have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close
        - Okay and I'm going to talk with STUDENT and Jazmin and Luis
        - They do they use a lot of equipment don't they?
        - Uh huh
        -  That's a good connection STUDENT
        -  Yeah, but there's usually in in this passage that you guys read I didn't see a lot of equipment that they used, but you are very, very right
        -  Good job
        -  I saw you, that you put NASA sentma small machine
        - STUDENT in your answer
        - It is called a lunar orbiter isn't it
        -  So very good job, um,
        -  And I do want to give you guys a little pat on the back that your answers do look a lot better than your initial answers
        - Just looked at your revised answers
        - Okay
        -  Okay
        -  So we'll talk about that here in just a minute
        - Yeah, NASA does have
        - Thank you for your input, STUDENT But I just asked Farrah a question
        -  Would you mind letting her respond?
        - Okay, so I've got a microscope really closely
        - Ah, there we go
        -  Okay
        - Very good, thank you
        - Absolutely
        -  Thank you for sharing now
        -  So, you, you're right, they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely
        - Your answer is not wrong
        -  Okay
        -  You're right about that
        - Oh, right
        -  So, it is a small machine that is correct
        - There you go
        -  Very good
        -  So that is the answer that we're looking for
        -  STUDENT
        -  That is correct
        -  Thank you
        -  So if we go back and look in that text is that, so they did have to use all that equipment to get to space
        -  You are correct
        - Right
        -  We need you in here to help help us out
        - Oh well, STUDENT, and that's exactly why we need you in here
        -  Right
        - And I think, STUDENT you had said the same thing is Farrah
        - Exactly
        -  And that's in the text, very good for looking at the text and pulling that out
        -  And I did
        -  Awesome job
        - And STUDENT once look at yours and NASA send a small machine which you are correct about that as well
        -  Then they used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right you listed some equipment that Astronauts use
        -  Awesome
        - And STUDENT
        -  They did find water on the moon
        - SO let's look there
        -  Yeah you STUDENT
        -  That is correct
        -  So I think you the three of you, you read this question and you understood the text
        - Exactly, exactly
        - Right
        -  And that is correct
        -  Okay, thank you for that
        -  STUDENT Well, thanks so much for joining us, we, we really need you in this group today since you know a lot about space
        - Awesome
        - You said that they use lots of equipment
        -  Right
        - Very good
        -  STUDENT Thank you for reading that again for us
        -  So you had said that microscopes is what they would use to look really closely
        -  Right
        - Well, that's okay let's let's take a look at your answer
        -  STUDENT
        -  STUDENT
        - And Deb, you had the same answer
        -  Didn't you
        - Water on the moon craters full of water, then yeah
        - That is the text very good for finding that pulling out all the texts STUDENT
        - I think what STUDENT Jazmin and Luis I think you guys you read the text and you understood the text
        - Now, STUDENT, our science expert
        - Right
        -  That is exactly right
        - Okay, but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing
        -  Your answer is right because you were talking, your answer was especially talking about the equipment and you said that they need some microscope to look for water on the moon
        -  So, you are right
        - Your answer is not wrong
        - Oh, you were there
        -  Maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there
        - That is really cool
        - Wow, that seems really awesome
        - That was something super interesting
        -  Right
        -  That would be really, really great
        - Ooh, that would be awesome
        -  That's why you know a lot about space
        - STUDENT your dad is an astronaut
        - That's good
        -  So maybe today or in another class, you can share something that you have learned from your dad
        - Good awesome, amazing
        - Good and STUDENT?
        -  Yeah, that's a really good question and answer
        - Okay, thank you
        -  The next class about that topic, but I think that, yes, it's a very good topic
        - Maybe, maybe, maybe we can read another article
        -  Thanks, STUDENT
        - Or maybe you can share something that, you know, with the class
        - Microscope
        -  That's a very good answer
        - Very good
        -  STUDENT
        - That's a very good answer
        -  Thank you
        - Thank you, STUDENT
        - Good
        -  Thank you
        -  Good answer
        -  That's right
        - Lunar Orbiter
        -  That is the small machine
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you
        - Yes, that's a really good answer
        -  Yes, mean you are right
        - STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on LinkedIn, that that is a good answer to the question, What equipment did they use to discover water on the moon
        - Yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water
        -  So yes, that's something really good to add STUDENT
        -  STUDENT?
        -  Thank you
        - And I see it's the microscope
        -  Very good, very good
        -  Um, are there any other equipment you noticed in there, other than the microscope?
        - That's right
        -  That's very good
        - That's very good
        -  Um so,
        -  I'm proud of you
        -  That's good
        -  That's good
        - Phenomenal
        -  You guys seem to be hitting a lot of this
        - Absolutely, absolutely
        -  STUDENT you've knocked it out very well being able to read all through that and noticing both there as well as most of you here, Farrah Oliver did very good with that and Jazmin knocked it out of the park
        - Um, and I think another real benefit here
        - And I think STUDENT did really well in the kind of identifying a part of it that we haven't talked too much about and that's that
        -  Oh, you know, they found craters full of water on the moon
        -  It's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there, so STUDENT talk
        - Um, and that was an important part of this, so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading
        -  STUDENT and I'm really glad to hear you had a good time there, and I can tell that you've got some background knowledge, just like Luis had there and--
        - That's wonderful
        - Now, they discovered the water
        -  You got that right on the nose
        -  You sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share
        -  Well, even
        -  So being in this group doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it
        -  Maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about
        - Good
        -  I'm happy to hear that
        -  It sounds like you have some first hand experience and I'm really glad we have you in our little circle here because that's great getting some more perspective, like that, um,
        - That's very exciting
        -  I think a lunar orbiter is really key here
        -  Right
        -  Without that sort of orbiter right
        - Absolutely, absolutely
        -  They can't get any of their equipment up to the moon
        - That's absolutely one of the pieces of equipment that was used to send there and
        - I would say that a lot better answers the question
        -  And if we wanted to make sure it was perfect
        -  We might include how those
        - That's incredibly exciting
        -  I would hope that that's the case
        -  And with water here that could help us in our future exploration
        -  We're very excited to see that
        -  I'm glad to see you guys are listening to the topic and trying to expand on that knowledge
        -  We know that STUDENT did visit NASA
        -  So we're starting your sort of response with you need right
        -  I like the growth and I see that we're definitely getting closer there
        - You got a lot closer there
        - All right, STUDENT, you said that you use a microscope to look closely at what you found in the crater
        -  That's what I was trying to get out of you really want to look and be specific about what you're trying to look for when you respond to something right
        - Right, good
        -  What is that small machine called
        - A small machine, right, perfect
        -  You did very well
        -  That's how they actually examine the water and the craters
        -  It's the Lunar Orbiter
        - That is correct
        -  Yes, STUDENT?
        -  So, which is a good thing
        - So you're both right
        -  That's great about working in groups
        -  We all participate and contribute
        -  You just didn't have the--
        - Right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and STUDENT good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours
        -  So you're both right
        - That's awesome
        -  You can help me out with the other kids
        -  How about that once you just chill out for a minute
        -  All right
        -  So, STUDENT, what's up man, how are you
        - Okay
        -  So they did using what they,
        -  I liked your answers
        -  Scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - Well, good
        - Very good
        - Awesome
        -  I appreciate it
        -  That means just paying attention
        -  Good job
        - You are absolutely correct errors and you are that is very valuable when you're talking about spacecraft because it takes a lot of force to get stuff up in the air
        -  And if you don't have the heavy water
        -  Right
        -  That's very smart picking that up,
        - All right, good job
        - Okay
        -  And I know that's that's
        - That's, you know, that's interesting way to think about that question
        -  Let's go back to STUDENT and Luis over here while you're looking at that
        - Why don't you
        - Boom
        -  Very good
        -  That'd be pretty cool huh
        - Oh that is just around the corner
        -  On Musk is doing great things so
        - You know, they're working on it
        -  Thank you
        -  What you have STUDENT is a lot of background knowledge which is going to help you answer the question, because you have background knowledge and already understand the topic
        -  That's great
        - Okay so awesome
        - Okay, so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope
        -  Awesome
        -  Right
        -  So what the scientists are really looking for are the craters, where the water is found
        -  So you found that the craters are full of water
        - Okay
        - Okay, and STUDENT
        -  Your answer is not wrong
        -  STUDENT
        - Awesome so STUDENT used his background knowledge and he was able to infer based off of information that is coming from our passage that yes, scientists do need lots of equipment so that's awesome
        - Okay, how did we discover how did we find the water
        - Yes, and survey, Anna
        - Awesome STUDENT, so you're also able to reference your background knowledge to help you dig deeper into this passage
        - So I want to go back to what STUDENT was saying
        - Okay
        - So you all were the same
        -  So when you def
        -  So let's go back to what STUDENT Do you have a question
        - Yeah
        -  So, and STUDENT was able to use his background knowledge to let us know and to infer from everything that tells us in our passage here that NASA and our scientists are using a lot of equipment
        -  Yes
        - Awesome
        -  Can we all agree on that
        - Yes, STUDENT
        -  Your answer was never wrong STUDENT's original answer was that scientist
        -  So, earlier you asked you didn't understand why you were why your answer was wrong
        -  You would need something to help you find what they were looking for when they were looking for the water,
        - That's a very good point
        -  And they did
        - I would like to see if STUDENT, you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Your answer was correct it, you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very, very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes
        - No
        - That's good
        -  That's correct, yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Right
        - That's correct
        -  They wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon
        - Oh, that's something that we can look at together in some of our other stories whenever we start studying a little bit more on this
        -  On what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon
        - Both of you are correct
        -  What all do you know about space? Let me know, and that way, you can help me with the rest of the group, OK? What do you know?
        - OK
        - That is right
        -  Thank you
        -  That is a good job, STUDENT
        - Yes, that's very good
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - But you had a really good answer, STUDENT
- intent: r150
  examples: |
        - So we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right? All right
        - Does that sound okay
        - Let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you guys have questions yeah STUDENT
        - yeah so STUDENT we're learning about space, a little bit, but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills, so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills Luis
        - Absolutely absolutely so you guys, all I think should have an understanding of what this word equipment means
        - Does anybody have any questions about about what I mean when I say specific examples
        - Does that make sense to everybody does anybody have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def
        - Does that make sense?
        - Is anybody still unsure of what evidence means or is that something we all understand? raise your hand if you know what evidence is
        - does that make sense?
        - Hi
        -  [teacher name] and we're just going to be talking about your question today
        -  I'm Ms
        - So, in this article we heard a lot of things about NASA and the moon as a desert and let's just talk about your answers
        - So we have a lot of different answers
        - So let's look back in our texts
        -  Let's think about it
        -  And let's see if we had the best answer
        -  Okay
        - Okay, well, we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question
        - So did anybody talk about that? Let's see
        - You get it?
        - Now let's look at our question and let's remember what our questions said
        - So do you understand how we could improve your answer?
        - So that makes sense?
        - Anybody have any questions about that question?
        - That make sense?
        - Alright, so I have gathered you all here today because I'm concerned about each one of your answers to the question and you each talked about equipment or tools needed
        - Alright, so the next question is talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  And I brought you here together because I'm concerned about your answers
        - You ready?
        - so and you guys had varying levels of understanding
        - And which is a good thing, because we can help each other grow
        -  Um, STUDENT and Oliver
        -  Did you guys get a chance to finish reading, paragraph two, and revise your answer
        - All right
        - And I don't think you had
        -  Did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two,
        -  Yes, STUDENT
        - Guess that's all that I have unless you have some questions
        - Does that makes sense?
        - Does that make a little bit more sense?
        - You understand that
        -  Do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused
        - How Does everybody feel after you read that passage
        - Yes, sometimes we have to read this passage, maybe more than one time to really understand what it's saying to us right
        - So can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question?
        - But can you look back in the reading and can you tell me It just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because I think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading, you're going to have all those same answers about the water too
        -  STUDENT, it's totally okay when you just-
        - Whoa, okay
        -  So, that's okay
        -  So finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and I totally understand why we could get confused with them
        - STUDENT
        -  Do you know what that means
        - What is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us
        - That's right
        -  What that word that starts with an o, lunar what?
        - What does this small machine do and they go up on the moon?
        - There's always things you can learn
        - You guys see that?
        -  Yes
        -  So I brought you all back here into a small group because, um, I want to talk with you guys about your answers that you guys put For question number one
        -  STUDENT
        - I'm good
        - Yeah, I want you guys to just look at the question
        - And I want you to keep that in your mind
        -  Just a minute
        -  Okay
        - Does that make sense
        -  So I had you read paragraph number two, because it's really where our answer is
        - Very good
        -  Let's start at the top, then let's start at the very top, the moon is a desert right?
        - So, let's look
        -  So what did we, what did we look at and very closely
        - Very good
        -  Thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response
        -  STUDENT
        - Hi, everybody
        -  Yes
        -  Did you have questions
        -  Let's see
        - Let's look at that
        -  Yes
        - Hey guys, thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me
        -  STUDENT
        - Okay, awesome
        -  So let's take a quick look at our responses
        -  Right
        - I think you may still be confused STUDENT
        -  Okay, but there is always something more than we can learn
        - Mm hmm
        - Okay, but I think that we always can learn something
        -  The moon and we are going to share our answers
        - So let's talk about your answers you already read the article
        - In fact, you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there
        -  So we have to think, um, why might that not be hitting right where we needed to
        -  But we got to make sure when we're answering these questions, we really read and we really try to figure out what does this question want from me?
        - And you, like I said, you hit a very important part of the article
        - So you kind of see where we went wrong?
        -  Today, STUDENT, and hopefully we all can grow and learn a little bit from what we're going to be doing today
        - Thank you for your help
        -  What was the Oh, pardon me, STUDENT, Farrah
        -  And like I said, I appreciate your analysis there so STUDENT
        -  So that's good
        -  Yes, question
        - Thank you
        -  That's an area we can improve
        - And you think you've got it out
        -  So there were some room for
        - Does that make sense
        -  That's okay
        - So hey guys reason I brought you together is I was looking at your answers these questions on this text, we just read and I just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff
        - You circle, the same as savannas, does that help you any
        - Does that make sense
        -  Do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question
        - Alright guys, any more questions can be any other way
        - So I'm STUDENT or Luis, Are any of you ready to dig deeper and tell me another answer
        - We're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from
        -  Well, we've all been separated into a different group
        -  That way, we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions
        - Right
        -  You can do that
        - In your own words
        - OK?
        - Does anybody else have any questions on why it is the microscope
        - Well, that's awesome
        -  Well, I just want to kind of talk to The small group just to have a little bit more extra time with you to go over a few things I'm looking at your responses
        - For the first question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  I want to talk about that question real quick, before, Before we go to lunch
        - Does that make sense
        - Yes, you did a great job on that we are just wanting to I'm just pulling people together, just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question
        -  So we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers
        -   And so your piece of evidence was just a little bit bigger
        -  And so you just have to add on a little bit, little bit more than them
        - Because we chose to do a different piece of evidence
        -  Are you guys feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text, Mr STUDENT
        - Okay and STUDENT
        -  I just wanted to touch back with you and STUDENT
        -  I know you had the same answer is STUDENT
        - STUDENT and Luis
        -  Does that help clarify that question
        - Does anybody else have any questions
        -  Any other questions
        - Okay, thank you
        -  STUDENT for your question
        - That make better sense?
        - Is anything else I can do to clear this up for you guys
        - Any other questions?
        -  I have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon
        - Great
        - So, anyone else have any other questions
        - Understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  And each one of you had different answers in your journals
        - Okay
        -  Does anyone have any questions
        - Does everyone understand now
        - That make sense?
        - Does anyone else have questions
        -  No, it doesn't say that
        - Doesn't say that right
        -  And I want to get a couple of clarifying questions have for you
        -  Okay
        - I've read your answers
        -  So let's start with STUDENT
        -  STUDENT
        -  Yes
        -  Well, so do you guys had an opportunity to review the discussion question?
        - Great
        - Great, great, great answer
        -  So STUDENT Do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer?
        - Right, you find something
        -  Do you agree with that everybody
        - Exactly, so not what they used to look at it
        -  So I wanted to go back
        -  Is there anybody else who wants to share on that and that issue
        - Our high quality answer can be found in the text
        -  Yes, STUDENT well
        - STUDENT any you look a little, little stunned
        -  Is there something I can help you with
        - Sometimes it is if you listen to the question
        - stop right there
        -  Okay
        -  So did everyone, did everyone read that with her
        - Did you read that STUDENT with her? Okay
        -  STUDENT, id you read that you
        -  STUDENT So maybe we could look at this together
        -  Appreciate that answer
        - Okay
        -  And maybe we could come to some new conclusions possibly
        -  But let's talk about this for just a minute
        - Okay, I appreciate that, that you that you feel that way
        - Yes
        -  Okay
        -  And so everyone corrected their answer, but we're going to talk about that today
        - We're going to talk about our
        - Stick around
        -  Yes, we're going to talk about our corrected answers
        - Sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever
        - So we answered our last question
        -  So we're going to move on to a new question
        - Alright, so let's just go ahead and see and let's talk about some of the things that you've done
        - Alright, so let's look at the question, right
        -  And let's look at your answers
        -  Okay, so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer
        - Yes
        -  Good
        - Does that make sense?
        -  Are there any more questions
        - Great
        - Yeah, so I understand
        -  And I feel like you guys were all around the answer, but we are we're looking more for specific answer
        -  That's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text
        -  So I looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for
        - Well, I look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading
        - What do you guys have questions about so
        -  For instance,
        - So how is the water in the passage like let me give you an example
        - So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to
        - So if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to
        - Does everybody see that sentence
        -  So real quick, I'm just clarifying what the question is really asking
        - Okay
        - Um, well, as I said for the first question I think we were put in a group, just to have some discussion because everybody's answer was different
        -  Yes?
        - So we are going to think a little bit
        - Okay, so, reflecting in our answer
        - Accepted okay and we are going to move on and to improve our answers to learn better about our subject
        -  Okay, don't feel it's wrong
        -  Thank you for for your input
        - Because I am concerned, I think that you need to read a little bit more
        -  And you can connect that with what you are learning
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for sharing that
        - Okay, but there is an experience that you you had when you went to NASA
        - Make sense?
        - Does anybody else have any questions about their answer
        - So maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does
        - You guys think so?
        -  Um, and before we begin, what was the most interesting thing
        -  You guys found in the article
        - And that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today
        -  So I really liked reading all of your answers
        - Yeah, you got it?
        -  So for us to talk about the question just for a minute before we really dive into those answers
        - It is cool
        - Now taking that in mind, I would like to talk about your answers just for a second so
        -  So remember back to our question
        -  We just have to find convincing evidence for its value
        - That's right
        -  And like you said, we've done that
        -  We have tons of ways that it can be used
        -  Right
        -  I'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  So each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another, and we're going to discuss what we understood
        - Think we all should be here
        - So we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments
        -  Okay, STUDENT, we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer
        - And that's what we're doing right now in this class
        -  We're looking deeper into these questions and our answers
        -  Does that sound good
        -  See if I can help me from the text finish that sentence
        - I'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and I want somebody
        - Yeah, and then also our reader knows what we're talking about route
        -  I'm going to look at your responses, real quick
        - Let's see
        - In the original time but it's, I want you to work on that next time
        -  And that's a good response so
        - So let's think a little bit deeper about that
        -  And so, so we've decided and
        - we have a lot of good information
        - Is there anything else that you can find in there, why go back to STUDENT to you read and see if you can find something different than Farrah
        - Does that answer your question, STUDENT
        - Okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit
        -  Okay
        -  And let's just see where we get
        -  Well, that's what we're working towards trying to see where everybody's at and we'll get there
        - Okay
        -  Did you read it for me
        - How about you, STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - and as you're reading a lot of times you need to use a finger pointer to help you point as you're finding your words
        - You see it?
        -  And you might find out that you'll learn some new strategies that might help you with other prompts or stories or questions that might help you in the future
        - Well, we might can look just a little bit closer
        -  Would that be okay?
        - So I think it might be good for you in the group and listen to some of the strategies I want to share with you guys
        -  Hopefully we can find some strategies that work for you and you can use
        - Okay
        - Exactly
        -  That's exactly what I want you to start looking for and we're gonna keep going and keep going a little deeper into the rest of the group's answers and see what we can find out, but you are on the right track
        -  So what machine discovered water
        - A lunar orbiter
        -  But we could have made it just a little bit more detail
        - Absolutely
        -  So do you understand how your answer was right
        - It is the Lunar Orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better
        -  Does that make sense now
        - Right, so our microscope is used to look at our water, but we've already discovered our water with the Lunar Orbiter
        - So really good job, you guys, but there are some more that we can look at
        - We're gonna be doing a lot more practice with these questions so that you feel comfortable with it
        -  Yes
        -  STUDENT
        - Alright, so you have all shared your responses and I can see that we have have different responses here
        -  That you like hearing about like learning about space, but maybe,
        - Oh, well, there's so much more to learn
        -  Space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn
        -  That's awesome
        -  So the question is asking us
        -  So you've all shared your responses and they're all I can see that they're all maybe a little bit different, but I think we need to relook at this question
        - All right
        - Now, if all five of us can agree upon one response
        -  STUDENT
        -  Yes
        -  Let's see if, now we can come up with a whole group response
        - So all five of us
        -  We all have I heard some really great answers
        - Well, I think there's always room
        -  To learn more, and sometimes we can learn from other people's responses and also maybe what I has to add to those responses
        - Okay, so we're gonna kind of review what the question was
        -  And your responses
        -  Correct?
        -  I'm not saying that your answer is incorrect, but maybe you could have put on because you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
        - Do you know how you could have
        - Does that make sense?
        -  Do you not remember reading that part
        - STUDENT
        - And so the water that they found is microscopic
        -  Do we know what the word microscopic means?
        -  STUDENT, do you know what microscopic mean? No?
        - Everybody
        -  But in this room, we're just gonna learn a little bit more
        -  Okay
        - Well, I'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it
        -  And you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space
        -  I noticed we kind of had a
        - Uh, I looked at your responses to the first question of what equipment designs is used as discover water on the moon
        - Very in range of responses
        -  Some of y'all kind of understood the question some of y'all are a little off
        -  And then I noticed that you put the same answer as STUDENT
        -  So does that make sense to you
        - Yeah
        -  Also, buddy
        -  Okay, so
        -  And then we can kind of talk it through
        - I think that makes sense
        -  Alright, so I just want to kind of look at some of your responses
        - Alright so this event and Divya What do y'all think is all kind of had the same answer
        - Does that make sense
        -  Once we've talked about it some more, um,
        - That is pretty cool
        -  You'll have to go home and show him this article
        - And so I'm going to pull back up your responses
        - So the other the other students that looked at that gave different answers
        - Together, because I just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article
        - I'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms, okay does that make sense?
        - Who told you that, that's not true
        -  I just wanted to clarify your understanding of the art
        - We just want to understand better Exactly what you're trying to say
        -  We were able to clarify that
        -  That's the lunar orbiter, we're going to get into more information
        -  That makes sense? Okay
        -  And when you said a small machine
        - And so I just wanted to kind of get your input and let you guys share with me your responses on the question
        - Does that make sense to you all
        - Does that make sense
        - Okay? Does that make sense?
        - The Lunar
        - ?
        - Well, perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a group
        - Does that make sense
        - Does anybody
        -  Does anybody have any questions
        -  STUDENT, but it is always best to, you know, sort of, definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning
        - And that may be the case
        - I have also looked at some of the answers that you have given for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So the question is,
        - If we wanted to explore perhaps more what would be even maybe more correct answer
        -  So for the most part, that so that, is the small machine the exact same thing is the Lunar Orbiter?
        -  Good job
        - OK, so the Lunar Orbiter
        - To talk about the very question is you might remember the question who could read the question that we have
        -  Okay, so she brought up
        - Because we're talking about the space in the moon, but the reason we're here today is to find out how that we can answer these questions and look deeper into it
        - And I'm glad you did that you know what you're doing
        -  You're reminding me like when we look into text will become a detective and looking deep into it, just like STUDENT and I'm sure to the rest of you
        -  We're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered
        - And STUDENT
        -  The same thing discovers like a verb
        -  You look at equipment you look at microscope and that is an equipment, but we're looking deeper into the question just like today
        - Okay
        -  And once you run it
        -  And that's I think that's awesome that you're thinking about that and looking at that and again that's a verb
        - Discover great
        -  A lot of you are doing it
        -  It's going to connect you back
        - When you're looking at a question, you will get where they're asking for
        -  And that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event STUDENT, sorry
        - So we, we read the text
        -  Did everybody understand the text water on the moon
        - Everybody understand?
        - Why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now?
        - Let's great STUDENT Maybe you can share some
        - Some ideas with us about the article
        - Okay, so I'm happy that y'all are all here today and I was looking over your responses
        - Everyone agree
        -  And that's okay
        -  We're going to look back at the paragraph
        - Yep
        -  Okay
        -  Um,
        -  I know that some of y'all had some of the same answers and then some of your answers was a little bit deeper
        -  So we're looking over your responses
        - We just want to be able to give the best answer
        -  So I just want us to expand and think a little bit more
        - That he gave us
        - I want to talk about, like, I want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the US deposits
        - Let's work together to create a sentence to answer that
        -  So we got the Lunar Orbiter
        - So let's work on formulate this sentence together
        -  Does anyone have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment
        - Perfect
        -  So what other
        -  Okay
        - That's good, that's good
        -  And you guys answered in your journal some questions
        -  So we all, we all just read water on the moon
        -  And I want to start
        -  And I saw your previous journal entry
        - So we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Does that make sense
        -  STUDENT?
        - Does that make sense
        -  You can do it, I believe you can do it
        - But then your answer is gonna be awesome
        - Okay, does that make sense
        - So I'm going To the question and your answer really quick
        -  Okay
        -  Alright, well, how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new
        - You already know all about space
        - can we now see why that makes sense
        -  STUDENT
        - I think you guys have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking, but I don't think we are fully there
        -  Yes
        -  Why don't you stick with us
        - All right, well, STUDENT
        - And see if we can teach you something new, even scientists are constantly learning new things about space
        -  So why don't you stick with us and
        - See what you can learn today
        -  Alright
        -  Let's, let's look at those two
        - So if nobody has any other equipment
        - answer choices and see which one makes the most sense and answers our question
        -  So does that make sense as to why
        -  STUDENT, I saw your hand go up
        - So does that make sense
        - Give you just a moment
        - And when you're done, give me a thumbs up or raise your hand
        - So do we do we understand why lunar orbiter is the correct answer to question number one
        - Well, let's double check our answers
        -  OK
        -  The way that it's asking us to
        -  That way we know for sure that we have answered the question
        - There are a couple other of your friends that are needing a little bit help with the guidance of where to find their answers
        -  Is everybody done reading
        - About 10 more seconds
        - Hi guys
        -  So today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you guys needed to answer and I want to first say thank you for answering the question, so what I want us to first start with is I want us to all look back to the
        - So you guys have already came up with an answer to this question
        - And who knows, you might even learn something new, as
        - Well, that's okay
        -  It doesn't hurt to learn a little more right
        -  So I looked over all of your answers for the question
        -  And I wanted to start by trying a strategy and see if we have different answers
        - I'm excited to work with you guys
        -  So now I want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers
        - Alright friends
        -  Okay
        -  Thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text
        - Hmm
        -  Alright
        -  Okay
        -  But we're all in this group to work on answering some questions
        -  Well, I'm glad that you know a lot about space
        - Okay, STUDENT, what do you think, do you agree with Oliver and Farrah
        -  So our question that was posed to us
        -  We're going to take a look at that
        - Okay, so we're getting ready to look at that one to hear from each person
        - Okay, we're just going to continue to keep going and dig in a little bit deeper into our text,
        - STUDENT are you looking at, paragraph two, there
        - Does that make sense
        -  It's called confidence and not everyone's confident are we
        - In my room
        -  I have a favorite word
        -  I want you to well fake it and see what happens
        -  If you think you know the answer, let me know and then I will do my best to guide you in the right direction
        - I don't want you to have those feelings in my class, even if you're not confident
        -  Does that make sense
        - If you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together
        - I hear that you guys have already shared out your answers and add honestly just like to go left to right and pick apart
- intent: r130
  examples: |
        - that's that's totally correct I think we'd all agree with you that if you had a microscope you would use it to look at water really closely, although let's think about what happens before that point right
        - awesome awesome okay STUDENT and Oliver will pair up and and find the answer to that question, thank you folks
        - STUDENT are you are you on board with that
        - now um can I get someone else let's build on samantha's answer can I get someone else to talk about how This microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now, can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes STUDENT
        - awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer, so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon? Yes, STUDENT
        - Add on, you know how exactly those equipment were used to discover water on the moon right, so I think each of you had like a piece of it, and then we just had it to we just needed to add on to that, so we have the microscope And that microscope was used so actually sorry um
        - does so, what other folks think about this now is that where we want to agree as an answer go ahead STUDENT
        - yeah and when you're done why don't you and STUDENT talk about Luis's new answer and compare your new answers while I work with other people
        - yeah STUDENT and Oliver have you guys were both reading, did you find something similar or something different to Harris and Jazmin and Luis
        - So like a couple people just circle microscope and that's a great example, but there are multiple tools like you just pointed out  that come from these things
        -  STUDENT
        - So what investigate mean does anybody know
        - No
        -  What is the type of word we used, but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words
        - So if we look back, it says that, they used a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - So did anybody say like a title?
        - So, to make our answer better
        -  We could say NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter
        - NASA sent a small machine called a loomer Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        - Okay then not full of water
        -  Once they found it
        - So, but what did they use to discover the water that, they used a microscope microscope to look at it
        -  You had to use a microscope
        -  You can't even see it
        - So NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it looked for ice deposits and the craters, and then they use that microscope to see it because it's so tiny
        - It is
        -  But they didn't use it to discover the water
        - But they use the machine, the Lunar Orbiter to find it to discover it
        - But then they use the microscope once they found it
        - This piece of equipment is used for a different purpose
        - They might
        - Use
        - The microscope is used for a different purpose
        -  They didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon
        - They do, yeah
        -  But all of those pieces of equipment are used for a different purpose
        -  We're trying to figure out which
        -  That makes sense
        - Yeah, the scientists use the Lunar Orbiter to investigate and discover water on the moon
        - So the equipment that they used is the Lunar Orbiter to discover water on the moon
        - What do astronauts use it for STUDENT
        - Yeah, so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource
        - is there convincing evidence that it's a valuable resource STUDENT
        - It would take a long time
        -  But eventually, it would be very, very, very valuable resource for astronauts to use,
        - Yes, we do need a microscope to look really closely at things
        -  But that is not what the scientist used to find the water on the moon
        - And so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water
        - But even, you did circle, if you circled the same thing as STUDENT, you are at, you at, you were both actually not correct with that answer, so if you would have circled about the Lunar Orbiter, you would have been correct
        -  You could have went into more detail, you put that it was a small machine, and it was a small machine, but, um, it is called a lunar orbiter
        - It is semi right
        - It says, NASA send a small mach, small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  So that should have been your answer
        - Yes, why don't why don't you look back you and STUDENT work together since you were you had the same answer
        - And you can talk about it
        -  Okay
        -  And I'm going to speak with STUDENT for a moment
        -  They might have used those when they discovered it, but they were not use to discover the water
        - No
        - And that is very close and
        - Yes, it is very hard to say without a microscope, but the lunar orbiter is very powerful
        -  But I like your thinking of what keeps the water together that is in our passage
        - Not exactly
        - STUDENT, could you help us out a little bit more, maybe with finding a different piece of equipment that they might have used
        - Well, they didn't send a microscope
        -  They sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right
        -  However, that's not, they didn't just send a microscope up to the moon
        - They had to send this machine called the lunar orbiter right
        - So you were partially correct that you do need a microscope to see this
        - Well, you are you are partially correct, but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the Lunar Orbiter and that was able to go across the ground, the surface, the moon surface to check for these deposits
        - But they also use the Lunar Orbiter to that's what they use to find the water that there was water in the crater, then they had to go and use a microscope
        - They needed their lunar orbit Orbiter to get to the moon
        - And see the surface of the moon
        - Then once they figured out that there was
        -  Okay, the microscope actually gave them the evidence
        - Deposits, a very small water then they had to get the microscope out to make sure what they thought was there
        - That there was water on the moon
        - Yes, they took the lunar orbiter was the
        - equipment that they used
        - Then the tool they used was the microscope
        -  It was, they will did send a small machine, but it really doesn't
        - Not completely wrong
        - It was more than the lunar orbiter that they use dry
        - Because it wants to know what equipment and so they sent the Lunar Orbiter
        - So that's why I said you're you're on the right track
        - And who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use
        - Well, the tool they had that the equipment they had to use
        - Was the Lunar Orbiter to find the water
        - Then to actually make sure that they see it
        -  They had to use a microscope
        -  Did you circle, those two words
        - STUDENT
        - Okay, so you said that you'd meet a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and you are right, the microscope is a piece of equipment
        - Okay, well let's look back at our reading passage and STUDENT and Oliver since you guys had the same answer of microscope
        -  I want you guys to look back at your reading passage
        - and if you finish before I come back to you
        -  Go ahead and work on the next question
        -  And STUDENT you also were right that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks,
        - Yeah, sure
        -  Okay
        -  That's right
        -  But we're going to look for one more thing
        -  Could you tell me what word another word that you circled
        -  One more
        - Valuable okay yes I agree that valuable is a key word
        -  Other key word in the question so STUDENT
        -  And that's absolutely something that was in that reading
        -  That is absolutely true
        - STUDENT scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        - I wonder, maybe STUDENT can help us out because I sent him on this mission to find this answer
        - STUDENT, would you agree with what Oliver said?
        - So let's hop back to STUDENT for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question
        -  So let's talk with STUDENT and see if we can work together on that one
        - Let's see if we can figure it out because STUDENT had the same answer is you
        - Okay, so there's two pieces of equipment that we're actually looking at here
        - One is kind of a version of the other slits
        -  Think about it
        - So wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one, but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon
        - Yeah, so they had to use the Lunar Orbiter and they also had to use the microscope
        -  Can anyone tell me what they think would be the answer to STUDENTs question, which is, wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can Jazmin support her answer with evidence that is the Lunar Orbiter
        - Okay that's a great question
        -  Okay STUDENT What do you think?
        - Okay, anybody else have a different answer than that
        -  Can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer?
        - STUDENT, can you tell me, or maybe how about with with Chris, he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry
        - Okay STUDENT are you able to help?
        -  And how many of you guys picked out equipment or discover
        - Perfect, yeah
        - STUDENT what did you get
        - Your answer was that scientists found I see using smaller machines
        -  But guys, did we know that ice is water right?q
        - So we were looking for
        -  They said, so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  So the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - And and that is an equipment, a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment, you are correct
        -  What were they looking for, again, was it?
        - Okay, perfect
        -  So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        -  You guys look at that together
        - Perfect
        -  How about STUDENT and Farrah
        -  Okay
        -  Awesome
        - How about you and STUDENT kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        - Yeah, and that's right, they do use that
        -  Right
        -  So yeah, they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon
        - Awesome
        -  Okay
        -  If it were astronauts on the moon
        -  That's right
        -  The astronauts use all that you are correct in that,
        - Well enough
        - How about you two get together and you reread the passage together and talk about your answer
        -  They sent the lunar orbiter up
        -  So those are pieces of equipment that they use it in
        - But in this specific case, they didn't need any of that
        - Well, okay
        -  Right
        -  So, that is correct
        -  So instead, it it checked for water on the moon
        - And it went
        -  If you guys want to look over that text again together, starting with paragraph one, two, and three
        - So maybe STUDENT and Jazmin
        -  I think that may help if you reread that okay
        -  Everyone, but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about, for example, the question is, what, let me see the question again
        - Okay, I read all of your answers and I think that you have very good points
        -  They sent a small machine, but you have to look for a better word to answer that question
        -  And that was right too
        -  But that was not enough for that question
        - STUDENT says that NASA sent a small machine
        - A better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon
        -  Yes
        -  Right?
        - Mm hmm
        -  And the small machine, I think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope
        - What do you think, STUDENT, what do you feel about what Luis said?
        -  Um, I think that may be you can read a little bit
        - Okay, so you said that NASA send a small machine and that is right, but
        - Um, to kind of build off that STUDENT
        -  Could you remind me of what the question was, what question are we answering here
        -  So with our question we're asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  I think that's a great response, but I think we can make it an amazing response
        - Um, I think that we can do even better
        -  You both pretty much gave me a good answer you gave me
        -  STUDENT So what we can do is you can kind of learn from Jazmin here and she can learn off of you were looking for a middle ground between the both of you
        - That's right
        - Things like the microscope
        -  Let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're, we mean
        -  Right
        - And the Lunar Orbiter
        -  We could say they use the Lunar Orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things
        -  We're almost exactly where we want to be
        - STUDENT
        -  That was really, really good
        -  But we're so close now
        -  We can still make a couple of improvements on the end there
        -  So thank you for your
        -  But what was the microscope attached to? Help STUDENT out
        - Oh, well, I'll see here, STUDENT, and I appreciate your feedback
        -  So what was the microscope attached to? How did they find the water in the crater?
        - Well, I mean, won't you go back and reread it and help Savannnah out and STUDENT, what do you think? You said you circled the same answer as Farrah
        - Not really, but that's a good guess
        -  STUDENT, what do you got?
        -  I'm Question you
        - Okay, I'm one of these are really good guesses
        -  STUDENT
        -  But we're still missing the point
        -  What do you got?
        - That's right, see you had one piece of the puzzle, right, you had the, that's what I was talking to you earlier as you mentioned, the microscope
        - And you know what, that's correct statement that you wrote down, you do need a Microsoft Skype look at something that's really small, but we when we go back and look at the question
        - So let's look at your answer
        -  Use scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do
        - That's very knowledgeable of you point that out
        - And that's a very critical tool when we're learning together as a group that's awesome dead
        -  And we're going to dig deeper
        - Okay, you are on you are on track to find the right answer
        - Awesome
        -  Does anyone else have a different response than STUDENT
        - So STUDENT
        -  You are right, they, they set that small machine
        -  And that's what they were using to discover where the water was
        -  And then why your elbow partner agrees with you
        - So I would like to know, I would like to hear from STUDENT, and why you found what you found
        - Would anyone else like to build on his response
        -  I want to see what you two can come up with together
        - Why don't STUDENT, you talk with Jazmin
        - Okay, STUDENT and Oliver, you did think that the scientists used a microscope to look very, very closely
        - Okay
        -  STUDENT and Chris are Looking back, and they're thinking about Jazmin's answer
        -  I would like for the four of you, and STUDENT can jump in, try and combine your answers and see what you come up with
        - So, STUDENT was looking in paragraph two, they sent a small machine and Farrah and Oliver thought that they needed a microscope
        -  So why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers
        - What do you think about that, STUDENT?
        - And actually, the water would be valuable in the future
        - Your answer is not wrong, but it's not totally right, either
        - Alright, so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water, but then the, the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope
        -  STUDENT, I would say, because the question is very specific meaning what a piece of equipment
        - I would say that you are almost there
        -  You said a small machine
        - Yeah
        -  So though small machine was named the Lunar Orbiter
        -  That was the machine that discovered ice or discovered water on the moon's surface
        - So they did use a microscope, but it wasn't the item or the piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon
        -  Of what that they found so they would add that
        -  So the answer, like a complete answer that I'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon
        - Where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water
        - Yes, they use all all of those are examples of equipment and just for this particular moment
        - And for this particular reading The biggest piece of equipment that they use was that lunar orbiter that they used to discover
        - Okay, and they do use that and NASA and that is a good point
        -  But I have a question
        - What did you say STUDENT
        -  Do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well
        -  Good job
        -  Okay
        -  Can you give me a thumbs up if you agree
        -  If you're not quite sure, or thumbs down if you disagree with STUDENT
        -  A thumbs in the middle
        -  STUDENT
        -  Can you guys do that
        -  I want you guys to give me
        - That is absolutely correct
        - Okay, so the anybody get a different answer for STUDENT?
        -  What do you get
        - Did anybody get a different answer from STUDENT
        -  Um, STUDENT, what did Oliver
        - Or anyone else find anything different?
        - But what this article is talking about is how they discovered water on the moon, and I use a lunar orbiter to find [?] water on the moon
        - That's how you got to know that there's water on it
        - And then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet, but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water
        - They didn't really use a microscope to find the water
        -  The water was located underneath the ground
        -  They had the machine
        - Well, scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope
        -  The Lunar Orbiter investigating the ground for that water
        -  Well, in our story in the moon is a desert
        - Well, I'm glad you brought that up
        -  It doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon, so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today
        -  They sent that small machine, the equipment
        -  The Lunar Orbiter to investigate the moon
        - Correct
        - and they didn't use oxygen tanks, although they do use them
        -  They did not use them to find the water on the moon
        - The lunar orbiter was the machine that NASA sent to investigate to look for ice deposits
        - You would need the microscope to be able to see it
        -  So you and your answer and STUDENT's answer was correct
        -  It was a microscope
        - But I guess you could say, you know, they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it, but to actually see it, you would need the microscope
        - So they use that the Lunar Orbiter to investigate, but to see the water they had to use the microscope
        -  They did send the machine
        - It's sort of right
        - You did
        -  You said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they do use equipment like oxygen tanks
        - So the question was, you know, they're trying, they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon, but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon
        -  I'm sure you do
        - Really close
        - So that's what they use to discover the moon, the water on the Moon was the Lunar Orbiter
        - So who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist
        - So, STUDENT, can you add to that
        -  Okay
        - So a scientific tool called the microscope is a correct answer for looking at the water, but to actually just for the scientists to actually discover water on the moon, as it says in paragraph to the machine was called a lunar orbiter
        -  You can also underline important information that will help you answer questions after you are finished
        - So as you're reading and answering your questions always look back in the text
        - So they wouldn't exactly be using their tanks and their masks to find the water on the moon
        -  That's just part of their, their work uniform and protective clothing
        - That is the equipment that they used
        -  All right
        - Oh that is obviously a true statement
        -  Right
        -  You can't live without water
        -  So it's good
        -  Let's go to STUDENT's answer okay there's you said water is heavy
        - Okay, so let's speaking of waters heavy
        -  They don't have to carry it
        - and STUDENT, you can help out too
        - STUDENT What else is to say that oxygen, hydrogen could be used as
        - Well microscope is definitely equipment, but it's not used in space, like, because we
        -  We used the Lunar Orbiter, which was able to be controlled from, you know, from the earth
        -  And we didn't use a microscope to go and look for, you know, water on the moon
        - microscopes are used for to find tiny, tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger
        - Right, and so they use the Lunar Orbiter to discover the water
        -  Now they use the microscope to look at the microscopic organisms that were found inside of the water
        -  In this case, the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter
        - And so in this case case
        - All right, very good
        -  So I want you to talk to each other in your groups and I'm going to ask STUDENT Jazmin and Luis to be in one group and Oliver and Farrah,
        - The truth is that the lunar orbiter is what was used to actually find water
        - Okay, so we're getting there
        - The Lunar
        - That has a microscope
        - To explore for water on the moon
        - You say, both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it
        - That is a very good question to anyone
        -  Anybody wants to help him out and answer
        -  Why would they put a microscope, along with the Lunar Orbiter
        - To discover water on the moon
        - Okay, great
        -  Okay, so let's reread over the text because STUDENT and Jazmin are really close to the answer
        - To look for something, to, what do you, do you have anything else, STUDENT Jazmin or Chris or Farrah to add to that? Investigate means what, what does that mean to you
        -  The Lunar Orbiter
        -  What are some words you think we could underline or circle that might help a friend someone sitting next to you
        -  So if you got the right answer
        - And let's see if there are any other words in our text that might help maybe someone else in our group
        -  What might help your friend
        - So what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question, what do you think STUDENT
        -  Okay
        - OK, so the equipment that is scientists use is a microscope to discover the water on the moon
        - This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits
        - So they used the machine that you're talking about the Lunar Orbiter to investigate the water
        - and the ice deposits
        -  That makes sense? And then they used the microscope to look more at it, to discover
        -  They're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things
        - So they're not, they're not using the mask and things to discover the water
        - Well, yeah, that's what they all have to use just to be there
        - That's true, but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine, right?
        - Yeah
        -  So first they had to find it
        -  And then they could investigate using the microscope
        - and that is one of the tools that was used to do some observation and some research
        -  What do you think
        - And while I talked to some of the others
        -  Maybe we'll discover it together
        -  Okay
        -  Let's work together to see if we can find this answer
        - OK, let's see if we can put it together
        - So let me see
        -  Um, let's see what other answers we have that we could talk about and work this out together
        - and let's see class
        -  They found craters full of water on the moon
        -  Raise your hand if you think that's a true statement
        - so let's see who can add to that
        - So maybe there's something that you can go back to that text and see if you could find some more
        -  So if we put STUDENT's information with your information and we work together, we can come up with a full and more complete answer
        - Okay, so that's that's part of an up
        -  The answer is that we could have more space having more room
        -  And let's see
        - Okay, good
        -  So that's a good start on your answer
        -  But as they were as time goes on It could be
        -  I think that it could be valuable
        - Okay, so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet
        - Okay
        -  So eventually I think should go along with what STUDENT said I don't think we're quite ready for that yet, but I do think that maybe a long, as we research and in the future, that could be a possibility that
        - So you and STUDENT you and Luis work together and see if y'all can work to combine your answers and help each other out
        - STUDENT had a good start on his too
        -  So you think that you could work with STUDENT?
        - So, that was one of the things that was evidence was that you could drink the water from the moon
        - Yeah
        - See if you can look in your text and you and STUDENT can work together because you guys are kind of on the same page too
        -  So let's think of it as, you know, maybe it's not great right now, but in the future
        -  It can be valuable
        -  yes STUDENT
        -  Does that make sense
        - So maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question
        - Well, it's not completely wrong
        - So the lunar orbiter was the correct one
        -  That is the small machine that they use to find the water, the microscope was used to look more closer to the water
        -  And you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water
        - Yes
        - Okay, yeah, I understand you were really close
        - So, you were almost right, but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter
        -  And that's what they used to see the ice deposits
        -  Um, so yeah, good job
        - Yeah, they looked at it really close with the microscope
        -  So you weren't exactly wrong, there was just a more specific answer
        - That is, that's a very interesting take and it's actually my first read through and answering the question, I thought the same thing
        - Because yes, they would use all of that  but
        - And I'm sure that STUDENT and Oliver might be thinking, well, I picked a specific tool
        - Would it be on me, I guess, what kind of space plant would it be because Earth plants need oxygen to or, I guess, carbon dioxide that we give off
        -  So I'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow
        - Do we agree with her answer
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        -  You just need to elaborate a little bit more
        - No, it's not wrong
        - What could, Can somebody help STUDENT
        - Did we read about that
        -  STUDENT?
        - And if you have any questions, we can help somebody else can help out
        - Can somebody help
        - Right, you do have to have those things are question is about what the equipment, the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  If they're on the moon we know that they're using the oxygen tanks and stuff like that, but what did they need to use to find out about the water on the moon
        - STUDENT, can you help him out there?
        - That NASA sent a small machine
        -  Does that make sense?
        -  It didn't say that it sent the astronauts to space
        -  I really like what you said with NASA send a small machine, you are on the right direction
        -  So I want everybody to look at the text
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Right
        -  So could the lunar orbiter be the type of equipment the scientists used?
        - looks for ice deposits
        - And they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had
        -  But to find this equipment on the moon, or to find the water on the moon
        -  So you've got part of the answer, right?
        - In the polar craters
        - You've got a piece of it
        - STUDENT?
        - can anybody or STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me
        - And that was the orbit
        - NASA scientists used the Lunar Orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin
        -  It's am from our end
        -  I mean, from our questions in its and from the Senate's in the passage
        -  Correct
        - Does the rest talk with STUDENT about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the Lunar Orbiter
        -  I think you have the answer
        -  So, talk with STUDENT and help him discover which one it is
        - Good
        -  So, STUDENT
        -  So what did STUDENT, you say about the water
        - So then STUDENT Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon
        -  Does, does that sound like, I agree that they do use oxygen tanks when they're in space and in the moon, but I think what we're trying to figure out was
        - Yeah
        -  Do you want to answer
        -  STUDENT's question
        - STUDENT
        -  They do, they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it
        - Well, you're right
        - Okay, well let's ask your other classmates
        -  They talk about NASA as STUDENT was talking, they do send a small machine
        - Okay, but in the top of the reading
        - And they do talk about sending that you might need a microscope, which STUDENT brought up and Oliver
        - But the microscope is used to see the little particles of water
        -  Okay
        - Okay, while you were reading near the top, it does talk about a small machine that help NASA find water and it is called a lunar orbiter
        - And that's what they helped find water
        - So, STUDENT
        -  But what you have is a great start
        -  Your answer is not necessarily wrong, but we can go just a little bit deeper and to make your answer more detailed and just a little bit better than What we have right now
        -  And that is correct
        - So you said that NASA sent a small machine
        -  The, you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water,
        - Okay, so it says in here that water can be used for astronauts to drink
        -  So that's a valuable way that we could use water now
        - That's good
        -  They do need that
        - So the oxygen tank maybe used to breathe
        - But that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water
        - Okay, so they did find
        - Craters water on the moon,
        -  You were headed in the right direction, you would definitely need a microscope, because the water is so
        - Your answer is not incredibly wrong
        - That isn't what they used to discover it
        - And STUDENT, your answer was, scientists found craters full of water on the moon
        -  They did
        -  In the article did say they found craters with some water on the moon, but they didn't say, full of water
        -  They sent a machine up there
        - Um, I don't think so
        - So they sent a piece, they didn't send humans up there, so no one would need the oxygen
        -  Good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole, you had a small piece of the answer
        - Mhmm
        - So you might have circled water as well
        - So let's break it up into groups STUDENT and Oliver if you will be a group of two AND THEN Chris Jazmin and Luis
        - So let's take about 10 seconds each person is going to share
        - Group members, while the first person is sharing
        -  So we're going to start with STUDENT, you will be our first person to share
        - You are just listening to them
        - Debbie will be the second STUDENT, you'll be the third Jazmin forth and then Luis last so each person, you're going to have about 10 seconds to share your answer
        -  And then, STUDENT
- intent: r120
  examples: |
        - So let's see STUDENT what answer, did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - um so I was wondering if I could get them volunteer to share Their answer and what they were thinking
        - And STUDENT Would you mind reading for us again, the question that we're going to be answering together?
        - Excellent and STUDENT could you read what is the second part of that, what are we circling
        - and that's deb that's what I was going to ask you to read, is that second part of the question, there you see where it says circle
        - Excellent so we're looking for equipment that they use to discover water on the moon
        - And to recap we're going to look for that evidence so let's let's do a quick reread as a group of this so to keep going around STUDENT, if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there, where it says one For the name of the equipment they use
        - Excellent STUDENT could you read the second paragraph, for us
        - STUDENT just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph, real quick Would you mind reading number three for us
        - Thank you so much Okay, so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes STUDENT
        - So what equipment, did they use to discover water on the moon
        - So today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon, so thank you all for sharing your answers
        - can you read the question for me, what is the question actually asking STUDENT
        - One thing I want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so, can you read the first part of the question for me STUDENT
        - can you reread that chunk of the text for me
        - yeah so STUDENT What did you find you were reading, what did you find for me
        - hi so, can you guys repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from STUDENT all the way down to Luis from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah Luis do have a question
        - STUDENT repeat for me what your answer was, real quick
        - Great Thank you
        - and you STUDENT?
        - Wonderful. 
        - STUDENT?
        - Nice and STUDENT
        - Great
        - and STUDENT
        - Great So if I were to ask you again what kind of equipment, do they use what would you would What would you circle
        - Okay, so now we're looking at this first part of the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay guys, so I really like the way that you answered those questions, and I can tell that you look back in your text to find your answers, but let's all look back at our question
        -  Let's look back at number one
        -  Do you want to if you guys want to read this question for me
        - STUDENT, do you want to read it for me
        -  Does anyone want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is
        - Okay
        - So we are going to look back in our passage
        -  So I will everybody to get back into their passage
        -  Do you think you know it
        - STUDENT
        - Does anybody know
        - Okay
        -  Well, if we look back in the number three which says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on Earth
        -  The water they found is microscopic
        - Meaning you wouldn't be able to see it
        -  If you are looking straight at it, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close
        - So our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, so we're talking about the equipment they used to discover water
        - So we asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - So look back at your answer
        - Alright, so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, so what is your answer to the discussion question?
        - Go back to the text that you read
        - But what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon?
        - Okay, so what's your answer?
        - Is that all that they used?
        - Go back to the text and look
        - STUDENT, what do you think?
        - Everybody look back into the text and find what did they use to discover water on the moon
        - STUDENT did you find the answer
        - What equipment that they use to find water on the moon
        - So you answered the question, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - The equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that NASA sent to investigate
        -  Okay
        -  And so the first question that what you were to answer was what experiment designed, what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, thank you very much
        - nd first I'd like to address STUDENT Farrah, would you like to read your answer to us
        - Okay, STUDENT, would you like to read your answer
        - Okay, is that the only one that you circle
        -  So listen closely
        - Yeah, I'm going to read the question
        -  Okay, what equipment, did scientist used to discover water on the moon
        -  Okay, and STUDENT, would you like to read us your answer
        - Yes
        - and STUDENT that would you like to read as your answer
        -  You should be able to find your evidence in there to support your answer
        - Yes, if you look through there and then circle your answer
        - Okay, go ahead and do that for a moment
        - Okay STUDENT What do you think
        -  STUDENT
        - So let's talk about some of your answers
        -  Would one of you like to volunteer your answer
        - Our question that we have was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  STUDENT
        - Can we start with your answer
        - Help me understand if you don't mind what equipment they might use just to discover water on the moon
        - But let's specifically focus if we can On just how they discovered water on the moon
        -  What equipment
        -  Did they use to discover that water
        -  All of you can take a look at the question again
        -  It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  If you can take a look at your passage
        - And in your question
        -  Can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer
        -  STUDENT
        - Great
        -  Because your response said they found craters full of water on the moon, but can you look at your passage with me take a look at, paragraph two, and your passage
        -  Can you look at your passage with me
        - With their space suits by walking into the big craters
        - And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate
        -  Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters
        - I wanted to just STUDENT
        -  If you remind me of your answer
        - Teacher:And I'd like to take a look and read in paragraph four, if you will, STUDENT and and the group
        -  If you look at their paragraph four
        - Then the question two says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  STUDENT was that you
        - Um, let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea
        - So can one of you, would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph?
        - Okay
        -  Would you like STUDENT, would you like to read the second paragraph?
        - So would someone like to read me the third paragraph?
        -  Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, we've just answered what equipment
        -  Did the scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - That's right
        -  So let's look at our passage and see what equipment
        -  Can anybody tell me
        - Let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be
        -  Did they use to find that
        - Okay, but we're going to what equipment
        - What about number, paragraph two, could anybody find that answer
        -  Okay
        -  Okay
        - Let's look back at the text
        - Says, and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - STUDENT, maybe
        - STUDENT Let's talk about your answer
        - But what else, what other kind of equipment or tool
        -  Did they have to use
        - Can who can read that for sentence to me
        - Okay, it says the scientists said that one ton of a top soil there's a lot
        - Of work
        -  This would hold only 32 ounces of water
        -  Did you guys circle, a word
        - All right
        - Who would like to tell me what word they circled
        -  Did you circle in your question
        -  What word
        - STUDENT, let's start with you
        -  How about you, STUDENT
        - Good
        - So our second question that we answered, um, was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Can someone tell me what two words that they circled
        - So let's look back at our question
        -  It says, Is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Good
        -  So who would like to share what they circled on their paper or on their breeding passage
        - STUDENT, what did you underline or circle
        - Okay, STUDENT, you know, what did you underline or circle
        -  All right
        -  Then what did you underline or circle
        - Okay
        - but we're trying to figure out what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon
        -  Can you look back in the reading and there might be YouTube videos on this, too, that you can look at a little bit later, when you get back home
        - but we're going to talk a little bit about the wate
        -  Did you find that answer in there?
        - STUDENT
        - But take a look at the question and what it's asking, it's asking us what was used to discover water
        - But I do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again
        - And I want to challenge, just like STUDENT, take a look at that question
        -  Can you read the question for me
        - Let me point you in the right direction
        -  Okay
        - I'm going to point you to paragraph three
        -  Look at paragraph three
        -  Would you remind me of what you had told me before
        - STUDENT
        - Can you read the discussion question for us
        -  Again, STUDENT
        - Look at that question again
        - Can you read it out loud for me
        - NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate
        - STUDENT, can you can you keep reading in that second paragraph
        -  Can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading
        -  So I'd like to start with STUDENT
        -  Maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading
        - So, um, I want to know from you all
        -  What about you, was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading
        - Okay, STUDENT
        -  What about you, is there something really interesting about the reading
        -  And, um, STUDENT
        - Okay
        - Hi, STUDENT
        -  Thank you for raising your hand, would you like to share something interesting about the reading
        -  STUDENT You said you knew a lot about science
        - All right
        -  Was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you
        -  Question number one out loud for us
        -  Raise your hand if you would like to volunteer to read
        - Okay
        -  So could I have someone
        -  Will you read

        -  What do you think, STUDENT
        - STUDENT, do you have something you'd like to add
        -  So where do you think we can find the answer to that?
        - Okay, so we know that the question is asking us for the equipment that the astronauts use to discover the water
        - Let's go to question two is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        -  So, could I please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need?
        - Hi everybody
        -  STUDENT, can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document, please, just the first sentence
        -  Can you, can everyone look back at number three on your document
        -  So let's see
        - Okay
        - I'm gonna stop you there
        -  We're looking at number three, not at number one, can you try again?
        -  Can you do that for me?
        - All right, so, STUDENT, we're gonna stay on number three, but I would like you to keep reading
        - I'm sorry, STUDENT, what was that?
        - so STUDENT, will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document?
        - All right, so STUDENT, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Do you remember put for that?
        - What did you put?
        - All right, do you have anything else you want to add?
        - Right
        -  But our discussion question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon?
        - Right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So can you guys look back at paragraph two?
        - STUDENT, what else do you think?
        - I'm sorry
        -  Say that one more time
        - So let's look back at paragraph two, that first sentence
        - What does it say STUDENT?
        - Um, what, what did you correct it to what did you write down again
        - And let's just see what you guys got STUDENT
        -  Did you find one
        -  Can you gues do that?
        - So STUDENT and Oliver while I'm talking with Chris and Jazmin and Luis I want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used
        - All right
        -  Did you get the chance to revise yours?
        -  Um, and then STUDENT
        - Yeah, and that's that's understandable because that's what the question asked was What did they use to discover water on the moon
        -  The question we just responded to is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon? Okay
        - Okay, so we just read the passage about finding water on the moon
        - STUDENT
        -  Would you remind me of your answer again
        -  What equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Yes
        - Now, STUDENT, can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me?
        -  Could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two
        - Let's see, STUDENT
        - And STUDENT
        -  Would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please?
        -  How do we answer this question
        -  What was your response?
        - So STUDENT our science expert, out of paragraph two
        - I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
        -  Can you repeat that?
        -  This is specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water on the moon?
        - Absolutely
        - But this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water
        -  Does that help?
        - So let's look at your responses
        -  Right
        -  So the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - So who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment
        - Okay, perfect
        -  So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for
        - How about you and STUDENT kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you guys can help each other, look at the text
        -  STUDENT It will you read the question back to me
        - But we look back at the question for me
        -  If you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me
        - And then in the second paragraph, right there
        - Okay, so, but before we do that can STUDENT
        -  Will you read the question aloud to the group, please
        - So, STUDENT
        -  Okay
        -  Let's discuss your answer real quick
        -  Would you read it aloud place
        - how about STUDENT Would you go back and read paragraph two for us
        - But so we reread the question right so what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  STUDENT we read it to me one more time
        - So let's look at the question again
        - Okay, please, can you please read the question again
        -  The paragraph number
        - Number three
        -  Read again number three
        - And STUDENT, you can you please read the question again?
        -  Was it informative for you?

        - Was it interesting for you?
        -  STUDENT
        - Will you like to do that
        - STUDENT, what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today?
        -  One of my first question was what equipment did scientists used to discover water water on the moon
        - Okay, let's talk about the questions
        -  Thanks for raising your hands there
        - STUDENT
        -  What equipment do you think that they use
        - STUDENT
        - What do you think STUDENT? What equipment did they use?
        -  What equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Okay, so, STUDENT
        -  What was your answer
        - STUDENT
        - Okay, do you have something to add to STUDENT's answer
        - STUDENT, you want to add something?
        - What do you think this STUDENT?
        - Uh huh, that they used to discover water on the moon
        - But what did they use to find actually water on the moon
        -  But if the question says, What equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon
        -  What do you think that should be a good answer to that question
        - Yes, that is an answer
        -  Let's see
        - You know all about space
        -  So even if I remember correctly, you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks
        - That's a okay remember it is always find to go back and look at the text that can only help you
        -  So if anyone else wants to take a look back, feel free to do that now
        - So while we're letting you take a look back, let's dive into another response
        -  Um, we gave you a little bit of time, did you have a chance to look back over
        - Let's see, STUDENT
        -  Would you like more time?
        - So this question, remember it said what equipment did scientists used to discover
        -  And so what was your response to this
        -  Very good, thank you
        - Absolutely
        - Thank you for that understanding today so STUDENT, I'd like to hear your response
        -  STUDENT, I might have dismiss heard you
        -  Could you repeat your response for me, word for word just an I make sure I
        - So, uh, and I'm so sorry
        - So, because at the end of that right they get a little more specific
        -  Right
        -  What did they use to discover
        - It says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  What was your answer to the question number one
        - So STUDENT, let's start with you
        - What is the question actually ask us
        - Okay, so let's look at the question what equipment
        - Did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Ah, say that statement
        -  One more time
        - So why don't you read that question for me again
        - Okay, so now let's look at your statement
        - Now once you read your statement again
        - Okay, so what is
        - Okay, so what, what, why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so STUDENT wants to read the second question for us
        -  No
        - Using this strategy
        -  How would you answer that question
        -  What do you think about the answer to the question is
        - Once you read that to go back to STUDENT Chris
        - Also, let's hear
        - STUDENT, what was your answer to this question
        -  So, STUDENT, what you got
        -  I just say it might be some improvement there
        - Say it's not a good answer
        -  Sorry
        - What was your answer
        - So, but if we look on down in paragraph
        - Well he's reading that
        -  What was your answer
        - Did you guys did you have any luck, searching for more stuff over there
        - You just said it does know what was your answer
        -  STUDENT What's another use
        - Right
        - It would be a good answer to the question, right
        -  Let's look at the question again
        - Is there convincing evidence that water on the
        - Moon could be valuable
        -  Yes
        - Hi guys
        -  STUDENT
        -  So our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question
        -  It says circle the evidence in the texts that we can use to answer this question
        - So let's look back at our question
        -  It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        - In their paper with me
        - Well, what was your answer to what equipment ID scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - but we are wondering what equipment did they use to find this
        - STUDENT, I would like to hear from you
        - Yeah, that's a good point that you do need oxygen tanks whenever you're in outer space, but we're talking about the different pieces of equipment that you need to be able to see what's on the moon
        - You remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment?
        - Well, they will need it to help them breathe, but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon
        - The small things on the moon was having to be looked at, through a what STUDENT?
        - And STUDENT I noticed that you circled the same thing is what Farrah did
        -  All right, guys
        -  We're moving on to question number two, which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - All right
        - What do you think, STUDENT? What was your answer on that? Do you remember?
        - Alright, so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  Would anybody like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon S
        - So
        -  it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth
        - But in that first paragraph
        -  However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon
        -  STUDENT
        -  All right, so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable
        - Alrighty guys welcome back from lunch
        -  We're going to start with a new question
        - Paragraph two, I'm going to read and I want you to follow along
        -  OK, now I'm going to stop there
        -  It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar Lunar Orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Okay, so can you tell me your answer again
        - So if we look at paragraph two, I just want you
        -  You can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud

        - So now I'm going to read the next sentence
        -  Okay
        - It says that this lunar orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater
        - Okay, so everybody has just given their answers to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Absolutely
        -  At that point, you've just got to find it in there
        -  When you find something in the text, could you let me know

        -  Okay
        - Let's back up a little bit more to paragraph two, okay
        -  These ice deposits are very small
        - It says, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Okay STUDENT What did you create your answer to?
        -  Um, what other questions do you have STUDENT
        - Okay
        - Okay, so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon, STUDENT
        - But how did they discover water on the moon?
        - So why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon
        -  Has everyone had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon
        - Good
        - So, who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - But the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - So going back to the question
        -  What equipment didn't scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - It was, is there
        - So what about you, STUDENT?
        - So why don't you go back to your passages and You know circle some or go back to the question and read it again, and let me know if you have any questions
        - The question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  STUDENT
        - Let's look at your answer
        -  Um, so the question was what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon
        - Thank you
        - Through the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon
        -  It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate
        -  But if you go to the second paragraph, and the very first sentence
        -  The moon is a desert
        - In the first paragraph tells us what scientists have known for a long time
        - Says the orbiter will land at the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater
        - Who can answer that question
        - So tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon
        - Can you repeat that please
        - STUDENT
        -  Can you tell me
        - They used that equipment to keep themselves safe in space
        -  But the question for discussion is what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon
        - Scientists did use a microscope to look at the water that they found
        -  The question was, how did they discover the water on the moon
        -  So the microscope was looking at actual droplets of water after it was, the water was discovered
        -  But the question was asking what was used to discover the water on the moon
        -  So I first want to start with STUDENT
