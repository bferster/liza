3,,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
5,,Farrah,,,"great we're so excited for your class "
9,,Farrah,,,"okay how about how about the wildcats because that's our that's our school class "
11,,Luis,,,"yeah i'm okay i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17,,Farrah,,,"yeah okay um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26,310.1,Farrah,,"awesome so student and student get awesome points for circling the parts in the text prompt because that was the the direction so a direction for following points ","as well okay you said what do they use before the microscope and i guess i guess i don't really know i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
31,420.3,Jazmin,,"Can you and Oliver work together to go back to the text and figure figure out what that machine was called, is that cool? ","okay well okay i said nasa sent a small machine "
36,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i have to look so yeah "
41,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell student that lunar orbiter is the right answer and so i guess i guess i know that now but i don't know um how i how i would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense "
45,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay okay so first they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope "
48,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other "
51,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well it's kind of a comment "
53,420.3,Chris,,,"i went to nasa yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
57,420.3,Chris,,,"oh man oh i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way i didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article and i just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun "
62,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah um so i i should it be and this class i already know all about space "
66,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay i'll i'll stick around "
71,420.3,Farrah,,,"ok so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so i found it in part three and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope "
78,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i can do that because i had the same answer student about the microscope and so in terms of discovering the water the water so small that you can't discover something you can't see so i would need a microscope to see it to discover it "
83,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so i have a different answer on my necessary such a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
88,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so i found that in part two and it's in the very first sentence it says nasa center small machine "
91,420.3,Jazmin,,,"a lunar orbiter "
94,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like a robot thing and it can go into the craters the dark the dark moon graders and that's how it can find that that tiny tiny water "
97,420.3,Luis,,,"and greater "
99,420.3,Luis,,,"fit as a water as ice "
101,420.3,Chris,,,"okay well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
112,310.1,Farrah,,"i love that you class are really using the reading and pointing to specific parts and sentences in the reading to help ","okay well so my question is is it okay if i just say the microscope or do i have to less like all of the equipment like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things "
115,420.2,Oliver,,"you can focus on really building that answer out by identifying the scientific equipment and then explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon and then once you've gotten that you can add that to your answer ","i'm i'm so sorry i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for encouraging us to build on our answers but also build on each other's answers on and make them way better that was so helpful thank you so much "
119,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon "
121,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i have my hand up "
123,420.2,Luis,,,"well i just wanted to say before we go too far i shouldn't be in class i already know all about space "
125,420.2,Luis,,,"reacher every reader possible "
130,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i can do up um it says circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question "
136,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah okay um part one scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the rooms polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
140,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i would like to because this is where i found my answer it says okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these isotope posits are very small and so my answer was from this park it's a nasa scientist small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
142,420.2,Jazmin,,"how can we work in the text can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine ","oh well in the part i just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits "
149,420.2,Farrah,,,"and so i found my answer and part three i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also "
152,310.1,Luis,,"yeah and you pulled out something very specific and you found another piece of equipment that was mentioned in the text which is very good as well ","yeah you got it okay that means that the moon estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
154,310.1,Chris,,,"well since we're talking about equipment i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
160,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i guess if something is so small that you can't even see it how can you discover it don't you need to see it "
163,310.1,Farrah,,,"it says you need a scientific tool "
167,410.3,Oliver,,"i think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope ","oh yeah i just want to lock on and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go back into the text and look for evidence and look really closely at all of the words even just where it said you'd need even that was important and so thank you so much for helping us learn that today "
174,410.3,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about speed "
176,410.3,Luis,,,"okay "
178,410.3,Luis,,,"that scientists use oxygen tanks while cuz i know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space "
187,420.3,Luis,,"i love that you brought in that background knowledge student that fact about the scientists and astronauts needing those oxygen tanks that's really awesome background knowledge i am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text student ","oh okay let me see now they know it's not water deep craters small machine that's equipment lunar orbiter that's probably equipment i suppose it your microscopic scientific tool that's equipment microscope that's clear but ok so there's four four times they mentioned equipment in the story "
189,420.3,Luis,,,"oh i don't know "
191,420.3,Luis,,,"okay "
193,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
200,420.3,Jazmin,,"you mentioned the small machine but a better answer would tell me what the machine does so can you look at the text student and see what the machine does ","it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it lands at the moon south pole uh huh. "
203,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i'm okay um nasa sent a small machine to land on the moon and look for ice deposits analyze polar crater "
206,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay that's pretty easy i can just add that part to my answer and then i'm done "
210,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i just need to write something down and so we don't need to write anything just so we have to talk about it "
212,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay "
220,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so my answer was i'm a scientist you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely why did i say it all cuz i think that was the answer to the question and it was in the story and we had to find our enter in the store "
223,310.1,Farrah,,"okay so you read it in the story i love that you found it in the story ","yeah i'm okay so it says well i mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
227,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh um in that sentence no i guess you need us oh no i guess i don't know "
231,410.2,Chris,,"yeah so i love that you picked up on the microscope in relation to the word microscopic in the text but when we look back at the question it's only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water not all the other machines ","um yeah yeah i can tell you oh you know what while he's looking did you i went to nasa and i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and "
233,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah i'm cause i was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
236,310.1,Chris,,"yeah so student i love that you used your background knowledge about nasa and that you're using evidence from the reading ","oh yeah it says or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon "
238,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh well i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i just was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so um thanks for working with us bye "
244,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i was looking for the keywords about like discovering water on the moon and in the first paragraph there's a part where they say water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so that kind of felt like it "
250,310.1,Chris,,"yeah i love how you summarized that student so i love how you summarize the article student ","just the first one "
253,310.1,Chris,,,"it doesn't "
255,420.3,Luis,,"awesome so student i want you to go back to the text and i want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay ","yeah okay um i don't think i'm a should be in this class i already know all about space "
258,420.3,Luis,,,"and i will because i know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read "
261,420.3,Luis,,,"um okay to be honest i didn't really read that whole thing cuz i figured i already knew the answer "
263,420.3,Luis,,"awesome well student i have a job for you i want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay student ","okay "
268,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh well maybe i think that's the answer to the question "
271,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house they're talking about water the found and then they also named a piece of equipment which is a microscope so it's got science water they found and the microscope in "
274,420.3,Farrah,,,"um i mean i guess he was pretty similar yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong because if it answers the question about a science equipment the microscope has the equipment and they are using it to look at the water "
282,310.1,Farrah,,"yeah so i love that you were able to pull information out of the text to find that microscopes are used to look at small things ","let me see this means the moon is dry the water they found us microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it we need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean i guess i don't say bye all of all there are looking i thought microscope alone "
286,420.3,Chris,,"At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment. ","cuz i was just listening to the conversation and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and "
290,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah sorry i got distracted i was listening um yeah i think it's the lunar orbiter "
292,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said nasa send a small machine "
295,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i found it in the second paragraph and it's the very first sentence yeah that one was mine too "
298,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it lands at the moon south pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
302,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it looks for well yeah yeah cuz it's looking for ice so that's something yeah yeah. "
304,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm the same thing that they found that the lunar orbiter "
306,420.3,Oliver,,,"well i mean that's the only other equipment that they have in the story is the lunar orbiter "
309,530.1,Oliver,,"great job class so how has your thinking changed ","um you know what teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on but i was just thinking i wanted to say thank you for helping me use evidence from the text in my answer and arm and it made me feel valued when you asked me kind of questions about my answer sometimes teachers just tell me about how wrong i am and so i i appreciate it "
311,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye teacher see you next time "
314,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah before we do that excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
317,530.1,Farrah,,,"yes okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
319,530.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm i circled the same as student "
321,530.1,Chris,,,"okay well i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
323,530.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i said that nasa send a small machine "
325,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks "
330,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay um as like a tool or something you use to do something Oh, like a pencil. "
337,420.3,Jazmin,,"i want you all to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","so i circled two words i circled small machine and i don't understand why and i answer is wrong "
339,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i can i can look "
341,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay um nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
343,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so so i just need to circle then maybe i just need to circle lunar orbiter "
347,420.3,Farrah,,"so for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment ","okay well microscope that's also equipment so um why is it the lunar orbiter and not the microscope "
353,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah well it says that there's it's a scientific tool so that tells me it's equipment "
357,420.3,Chris,,"who remembers when student asked what equipment was and student said that it's like a tool right so you can look for keywords like that ","yeah well actually it's a comment um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
361,430.2,Chris,,"student was telling us that he knows a ton of stuff about about space and you seem to also have a good understanding and those are definitely things that some astronauts use but if we're reading this article we want to draw specific examples coming from that to answer the question instead of just personal experience or background knowledge ","oh so it has to be from the story "
368,430.2,Oliver,,,"oh well actually i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because your explanations were were really specific and that really helped us understand why each one of our answers could could be even better so thank you so much "
372,430.2,Luis,,,"um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
378,510.1,Farrah,,"so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence. ","okay um evidence means like a word or a sentence that's in the story that you use when you answer the question "
387,510.1,Jazmin,,"when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question ","i think i found that equipment in my answer i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
395,430.2,Jazmin,,"but where i'm a little concerned because you didn't find that textual evidence right so we're trying to circle maybe a sentence or a few words that can help us answer the question with details from the text ","um yeah but i did that um the first part the first sentence in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. "
400,510.1,Chris,,"we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use alright student can you explain to me what evidence is ","okay um so like student said it's like um something um from the story that answers the question "
402,510.1,Oliver,,,"okay well i mean i guess it sounds like the right answer is you know lunar orbiter um and that's in the text but i kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too "
408,430.2,Chris,,"so student and student both circled microscope that is a half the answer but you should also include something that helped them get to the water and how they were able to look closely at it ","will i um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
412,510.1,Chris,,"when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us ","so i have to find the equipment in the story "
416,530.1,Oliver,,"you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation ","um okay so um i guess what i learned is that um i should read the story really carefully because um even if i have part of the answer i might be missing part of the answer "
418,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um i learned to make sure that i read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear "
421,530.1,Chris,,,"okay um i learned that if it says evidence you have to say something in the story "
424,530.1,Oliver,,,"um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now "
429,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on moon "
431,420.1,Luis,,"all right class i want you right now to look at this question and i want you to underline in this question what you think the most important word or the keyword is in this question ","yeah so i kind of know like all about space like i don't think i really need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff "
433,420.1,Luis,,,"okay "
435,420.1,Luis,,"do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it ","yeah like the question on the text "
438,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon um any you said that question like we can you say it again "
440,420.1,Luis,,"yes i can i want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and i want you to find the most important word or the keyword that you think is most important in this question ","oh i got it okay um equipment "
446,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so i was saying that you know scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i i was i was underlining um i i was underlining wait in the question or in the text "
448,420.1,Chris,,"in the question which most important word did you pick out ","oh yeah okay so i i underlined water "
451,420.1,Farrah,,,"i just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment i was just wondering like why my answer was was wrong because i like i feel like microscope is equipment "
457,420.1,Oliver,,"i want us to look in our question and i want us to find an action word because so far we've underlined equipment and we've underlined water but we haven't underlined our action word ","um yeah so it looks like the action word is discovered as that's yeah that seems like the one "
460,420.1,Jazmin,,,"discover basically means to like find something like to discover buried treasure "
466,410.2,Chris,,"So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great. But when you tell me about the tool. You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely. What are we trying to do to the water, guys. ","discover the water Um, yeah, I was just thinking like, Well, I went to NASA with my dad so I know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, and I guess I was like that when we talked about like what equipment. It feels like that's missing from the, from the reading or I don't know. Like, that seems like it's important "
470,410.2,Oliver,,,"it's like machines or or things you use to help you do something "
475,410.2,Oliver,,,"so right now we are trying to answer the question what equipment good so it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool I'm so sorry I'm unfortunately we have to go to the next group and have to end this session, but thank you so much. "
477,420.3,Luis,,"so i want class to look in your text at paragraph two and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water ","um yeah i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut "
480,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah he he talks about it all the time and like that's how come i know so much about space "
484,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so like a small machine it's a piece of equipment right like it's something you could use use "
486,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it is a lunar orbiter "
489,420.3,Farrah,,,"yes so investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth "
493,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah um okay so synonym is like something that's like the same like a word that means the same thing right yeah exactly awesome yeah um a synonym for investigage is like is find the same "
495,420.1,Chris,,"so now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question that is a synonym for investigate ","oh oh oh "
497,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah discover "
504,420.1,Luis,,,"i yeah yeah i know an ice deposit's like on a planetoid or like a rocky planet or a moon on that it's like like ice like frozen water that's that's like on on the surface of the planet "
507,310.1,Jazmin,,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that. So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet. ","I think I know the answer. "
509,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so i think i was really close it's the lunar orbiter the lunar orbiter's what discovered the water "
513,310.1,Chris,,,"um i actually forgot what i was gonna say "
517,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so scientists found the craters full of water on the moon so i was wondering like um did they use they use the lunar orbiter to find it but did they not use a microscope "
523,310.1,Oliver,,,"it's helping them see it when they study it I understand. Yeah, so they they found it using the Lunar Orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope. So it was like two different things. They say, I understand. "
525,310.1,Oliver,,,"um synonym "
527,310.1,Oliver,,,"and that's how we discover discover "
530,510.1,Chris,,"the next time you're reading a tough question it can help you to look for the action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for ","so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and like specifically like you you really helped us clear up some misconceptions we have like you helped us to understand the meaning of the word discover and you also helped us make sure that we were using evidence when we were talking about stuff because we had to justify it in in the stuff that we were reading and that was really cool so i don't know like i feel like i understand like the question much better now so thank you so much "
535,510.1,Unclear,,,"um hi hi ms teacher name hi hi what's your name "
538,510.1,Unclear,,,"you can't see us "
542,510.1,Bennett,,,"okay ah you're seeing me okay give me one moment "
546,510.1,Bennett,,,"let's try this again um hi okay "
549,510.1,Chris,,,"now do you see me student okay great "
554,510.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me um i shouldn't be ni this class i already know all there is to know about space "
556,510.1,Luis,,,"um okay "
561,510.1,Jazmin,,,"well um i it's me student i said that they used a small machine that was my answer "
566,510.1,Jazmin,,,"um well i talked about the polar craters because i said that they found a lot of water in the craters um the small machine "
569,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh it's called a lunar orbiter "
574,510.1,Oliver,,,"oh i don't understand why my answer is still wrong yeah yeah me too i circled the same thing as student "
580,510.1,Farrah,,,"um you use it to look at the water "
583,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
587,510.1,Oliver,,,"sorry sorry Yeah, it's like, um, it's like, um, you said already. It's like when you find something "
590,510.1,Farrah,,,"um we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it "
595,510.1,Chris,,,"because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does Yeah, Farrah, she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it. well i know a lot about space too i went to nasa with my dad and i know that astronauts um they have like oxygen tanks and um they have suits and they have masks "
599,510.1,Chris,,,"okay okay well well i talked about water in my answer too "
605,510.1,Chris,,,"oh no no it talks about the craters not the equipment "
614,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh yeah ice is the same thing as water oh right yeah yeah oh yeah i see that ice is like it's the same thing because we learned that in science class about how like the three states of matter "
616,510.1,All,,,"bye "
620,510.1,Luis,,,"uh excuse me yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
622,510.1,Luis,,,"um let me see i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i already know that equipment that they use "
631,510.1,Chris,,,"um um what did they use to discover water on the moon um i don't know um like maybe oh well i said that they found craters full of water on the moon "
635,510.1,Farrah,,,"well in my answer i i talked about the equipment it's me student i said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to to look really closely "
637,510.1,Oliver,,,"i "
639,510.1,Oliver,,,"i was gonna show you that i have the same answer as samantha "
641,510.1,Oliver,,,"um that they use the microscope to look closely at the water "
644,510.1,Oliver,,,"um well i mean that's what it says it says here the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it "
646,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah the um the the next part of that says you know that you'd like let me look at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i mean i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
652,510.1,Luis,,,"well i think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water um well like when they were on earth you know because that's how you can look from earth on "
655,510.1,Jazmin,,,"and mine came from the text too but i don't know why it's wrong um well i i had a different answer "
657,410.2,Jazmin,,"okay you need to be more specific in your answer what small machine what was it called ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate um a lunar orbiter "
661,410.2,Jazmin,,,"um i mean i guess so i guess "
664,410.2,Farrah,,,"um well i mean i guess i don't know i mean i guess it's like but i still think like the microscope is is equipment too "
666,410.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
670,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay um but but but but okay so but i read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i understand that you said that student has the right answer but but why cuz that's a tool too "
674,410.2,Oliver,,,"oh "
676,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay they use the lunar orbiter to um they use the lunar orbiter to find the water and then i use the microscope to look at the water "
679,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay um okay class i so i get it because you you you told student what it is but i guess i i don't know like how how you got there like i know i can say it but i don't know how how um okay oh look student i think well it's time for us to go to lunch but i think what she was telling us is that we just have to keep looking at the text right cuz that's where you said a bunch of times like you gotta go back to the text you gotta go back to the text so so okay yeah thanks thanks i think we gotta look at the text more student that was the problem okay bye thank you "
681,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i'm not sure like why i'm here because i already know like all sorts of stuff about space "
688,410.1,Luis,,"also student your question or your answer had to do with equipment as well but you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the moon ","now it's so they don't need the oxygen if they're going up to space "
690,410.1,Luis,,,"ah ok gotcha yeah "
692,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i guess i was just wondering like what my answer was because i'm i'm still not quite sure like i can understand that they were looking for the equipment but but they didn't use the but the microscope wasn't the right answer "
697,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh what do you do you "
699,410.1,,,,"you want all of us to look at the text or are we just waiting for the vamp "
703,410.1,Chris,,,"um yeah i guess i well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like when like oxygen tanks at masks and shoot "
712,410.1,Jazmin,,,"another word is a small maching "
714,410.1,Jazmin,,,"a small machine right "
722,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to let you know my dad is actually an astronaut "
731,410.1,Jazmin,,,"is there anything that you missed it "
733,410.1,Jazmin,,,"you that like the water "
736,410.1,Jazmin,,,"you could use the water on the moon in a garden and they could be like a moon garden out of it "
739,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry i said that you could like you could go and use the water and you can see "
746,410.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so you could basically be like i also waters so you know it's really good that they don't have to carry it in ships "
749,410.1,Luis,,,"um well water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen "
754,410.1,Jazmin,,,"well and use oxygen to breath and the water to stay hydrated and feel like they have to have water "
757,410.1,Luis,,,"well well i was gonna say like they use it for like rocket people they can use hydrogen and make make food for the spacecraft "
767,410.1,Farrah,,,"i'm still kind of you know like i i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like you could use the hydrogen fuel and you can use the oxygen to breathe but i don't think it's like convincing evidence mostly because i didn't think that it would be possible for a long time so like i guess evidence doesn't seem very convinced because they say like in really they said i use the moon water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting getting out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money "
769,410.1,Farrah,,,"it would be you know like it would take a long time "
773,410.1,Oliver,,,"well i guess i sort of agree with student i got it kind of depends on like that time so if you're looking at it are like like immediately then yeah it's not very useful but i guess in like theory but that's kind of a question like i i guess i don't know if i see that like even if it's useful someday if it's really valuable you know "
780,310.1,Jazmin,,"i can see the way you're thinking about it student ","and yet i just wanted to say and we have to match the lunch i just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular like something i really wanted to thank you for was like we were really able to understand like you explain what we need to work on and you know etc and how to improve you also really clear with like what you were concerned about and like what you wanted to work which is like able to get you gives us a chance to like go forward and figure out like what like i better today so much for all your work day was great working "
783,310.1,Chris,,,"um hi "
788,310.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space "
791,310.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah "
796,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i had the same answer as student "
800,310.1,Farrah,,,"Oh no, I would never do that. I know a lot of stuff. I like to watch stuff on YouTube and I like to read about space too. Um, I circled it, I circled that because I know that um that a microscope is is like a tool and this says, this says, if you look at the whole thing . It says that the moon is drier than the dryest desert on Earth. Why did they find ice microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you look straight at it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. oh yeah well that is why "
804,310.1,Farrah,,,"Oh, well, well, it's just that you know, um, me and Farrah both found the same thing right, Farrah? yeah yeah i mean like when i was i was looked at it and i saw that the question was asking about equipment and so um it said a scientific tool and a scientific tool like a microscope that's the same thing as equipment "
807,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um but okay well i don't understand what why my answer is wrong um me student right here "
812,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah But then why, my, here, if I was right "
814,310.1,Jazmin,,,"this table is for class who got the wrong answer you asked us to come over here because you wanted to talk about our answers so is my answer right or is my answer wrong "
816,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter "
818,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay okay but didn't i "
820,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well well i just mean like okay so i have the first part of the sentence i just i just didn't have that one word or like those words so that's all i needed "
822,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay well okay now i know the answer "
826,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i went to nasa and i know th oh sorry that's that's me student excuse me um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter "
829,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
833,410.1,Chris,,"they do but that's not what the um that's not what the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon it said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon it was the lunar orbiter ","oh oh okay okay so i get it like i know that that's the answer like the lunar orbiter is the answer but but i thought that i had the right answer you know because i talked about the water in my answer about like how they they found the water because i know that you know to discover stuff means to find stuff and so i saw in paragraph one where i was looking for like okay they find some water and it says that scientists found evidence that water can be found deep within a moon's polar craters so so like that's that's how i got my answer and so i "
836,410.1,Oliver,,,"um oh okay okay um excuse me it's it's me student hi "
838,410.1,Oliver,,,"um i just wanted to say that it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for coming to work with us and to really telling us to keep keep looking at the text because i heard you say that to class over here like that we have to like we have to look look at the text some more to try to find the answer so "
840,410.1,Oliver,,,"um okay thank you "
843,410.1,Luis,,,"bye hi "
845,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i really need to be in this "
847,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah i could do that "
852,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sure okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely "
855,310.1,Farrah,,"you did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer and you still address the equipment part of the question and i appreciate that ","thank you "
857,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i had a microscope and i kind of thought same thing as student "
859,310.1,Farrah,,,"i guess i still don't really understand why my answers wrong "
866,410.2,Farrah,,"look back at the question and take your pencil and maybe circle any important words in that question that you may see okay and in your answer you said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah you would need a microscope to look really closely closely but does your answer tell what discovered the water ","oh interesting so well i guess what i thought was that you couldn't discover the water unless you saw the water maybe there's another way that another machine could find the water "
869,420.3,Oliver,,"look in paragraph two of the passage to see if you might find another machine reread paragraph two of the passage okay ","okay "
873,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay so i said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
877,310.1,Chris,,"And they did. That's very specific and I appreciate you being really specific in your answer. ","so i circled water that was the main word that i circled "
882,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah and it's okay so it's asking what equipment yeah i was thinking about the craters "
886,310.1,Chris,,,"I you know my dad took me to NASA. And when we were there. We saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff. yeah like it wasn't in the reading did they use those to discover the water "
888,310.1,Chris,,,"okay gotcha "
890,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine "
894,420.2,Luis,,"can you be more specific and look back in paragraph 2 to see if you can find the rest of the or the more detailed part of the answer ","um yeah okay so basically what i said i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that "
896,420.2,Luis,,,"i guess not like i guess they must have used they used it but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask "
898,420.2,Jazmin,,,"fortunate we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really interesting it was really fun to work with thank you "
901,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i got all this stuff figured out so you know i think i'm all good "
906,420.2,Farrah,,,"so we did look through paragraph two we saw you know a couple different things in there i think that we have a new answer but we're still a little bit confused about like you know i'm still kind of like i i think the answer is the lunar orbiter right "
909,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so i think when i'm confused by is um i guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment it is and i just i'm just wondering like if the waters microscopic could they find it without a microscope "
912,420.2,Farrah,,,"it seems really cool "
917,420.2,Chris,,,"but that's okay um can i share my answer with you yeah i saw my original my original answer was that scientists found craters full of water on the food and then i think we were talking about how that wasn't really answering the question right "
919,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i think so i'm like i think that i could see like student and student said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer "
923,420.2,Jazmin,,,"although i see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all i was missing was the name of the machine right so i said like nasa send this small machine but i have to say like what evidence is i have to say what it is right "
926,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
928,420.2,Luis,,,"um no i didn't take a look yet "
932,420.2,Oliver,,,"um so i i read something interesting would like is connected i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so maybe they could use these things like i'm like the water pretty soon "
938,420.2,Luis,,,"so i looked at paragraph two and what we see and like what i was listening to class i'm like they said that the lunar orbiter was the thing and so i guess that makes sense that it was the lunar orbiter i'm like that's the answer to the question i guess i just keep thinking like they must have used other stuff but you said that that they didn't use the suits and the oxygen to find the water they used it to help them beyond the moon if they were on the moon "
940,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah exactly "
948,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i know i think that we all understand and i think that we just wanted to share so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really do thank you for like making sure that our answers were really accurate and you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and you also asked us like why we were like saying the things that we were saying so we got this think about like our own thinking and how that led to our answer like right class um yeah like i think class feels like they got to do something really interesting and i think that that like working with your class was really cool and like we also had time to explain all of our ideas and finally i think class really value so like everybody's answers like you were so like like supportive of our answers even even if they were right and that was really cool thank you so much for working with us it was really fun "
953,420.2,Luis,,,"well i was just gonna say like i already know like so much about space and like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class "
956,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah sure so basically what what i said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
962,420.2,Luis,,,"well i have to be honest i don't think i read it very close because i thought i knew all this stuff but it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe i didn't know and so i'm kind of looking through now and i'm seeing other equipment and you were saying like i need to think about like how like what is really finding the water is that right like not like maybe what they use also but like what really binds it is that right "
968,420.1,Jazmin,,"what's a really important word in that question that could help us find our answer can you take your pencil and just underline the really important words that could help us find our answer ","yes in the way that i underlined was well action like two words equipment and discover "
970,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so that's like something that you use to find or do you use like if you need something they have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean i use it to discover and so i said that it's the small machine "
973,310.1,Jazmin,,"excellent excellent thank you i see your line of thought and i really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out or to see ","i was wondering why my answer the question my answer was wrong you know why i was in the class it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer "
978,310.1,Chris,,"It was a right answer. That was one of our right answers. And I appreciate that answer. You did a great job using your background knowledge and using all the information that was in our text ","ah well i guess that's i kind of was thinking about what he was saying because i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them so i guess i was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters "
980,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah like maybe you know like i guess i'm not yeah like i was thinking like did they use that to go into craters and see like i i understand like it's not as much water like but like you know if we went in the crater like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits "
986,310.1,Oliver,,,"very small I'm, I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. I hate to interrupt, but we have to run. But thank you so much for working with us. It was really fun to work with you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye. "
993,310.1,Luis,,,"my answer was that you know is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable i think no and i think that because i don't think it will be a long long time um yeah and i i agree like i think know as well i don't think that's very convincing because it's not really ready so even though we think it could work like we don't know yeah i said basically the water is so good that ships don't carry it what if you don't have to carry anymore so basically i think yes that there's really convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you class are fine without water and also i was just going to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool on yeah and i really like was gonna say like water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
996,310.1,Farrah,,,"so no not for a long time i don't think that the evidence is "
1000,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah that's a really interesting question so when i look at the like here's what i saw i was thinking that okay a paragraph six it says to use the water scientists need to come up with a plan for extract or getting out of the polar crater the water and it says making this plan will take a lot of time and i was thinking like honestly that like it doesn't work yet so i think that maybe it would be valuable sure and i think it's very valuable right we don't even know how to how to do it so we could use "
1010,310.1,Farrah,,"and i really like the fact that you used those contexts clues and explained to me what extracting meant excellent reading you told us that extracting was getting the water out and i see where you use that evidence saying that it might take a lot of time and money so i appreciate that your opinion is that no you don't think that it's it's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable ","yeah i think what's interesting because i do think that it could be valuable maybe sure i see that in the reading it's not really valuable like that the evidence is it because we haven't seen like them build like a winner waters and we don't even know they can like they can we haven't seen "
1015,310.1,Chris,,,"yes that was me i was saying that you don't have to have water anymore get it from the moon "
1020,310.1,Chris,,"i see what chris's thinking was when he said that water is very heavy ","yeah "
1023,310.1,Chris,,,"oh i just said totally "
1034,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i would love to unfortunately we do have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to share with you some really cool stuff like i wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular you really helped us to focus on like certain words in the questions so that we understood like what we were looking for and i think that made things a lot more quicker and then like on top of that like you helped us to understand like you help us clarify our answers you know what i mean and you asked us about our thinking and like when we started like thinking about like what we were saying i think class right like class kind of had a moment of like you know like everything makes a lot more sense when we're like trying to you know what i mean like like we can understand and we can hear each other and we can think about like what class else's and then even like beyond that like you really help us to feel value like once you like heard about what we were thinking i think that like class felt like you really respected us and that was so cool because that's not like every teacher so i really appreciate that and thank you so much for just like giving it a try though thank you bye "
1037,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah sure i'll read it um me student i'll read it but but i do want to say i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class cuz i already know a lot about space "
1040,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay cool yeah okay um first paragraph scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
1045,310.1,Chris,,,"That scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. well like the craters on the moon are really dark um well "
1048,310.1,Chris,,,"um well also that that's where they found the water "
1052,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small "
1055,510.1,Jazmin,,"It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say ","um well i'm looking at it and um i think it says like okay nasa sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small okay so it's saying like they sent they sent the lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits "
1057,510.1,Jazmin,,,"um i don't know like like ice i guess "
1059,510.1,Farrah,,,"um well i go to the bank with my mom sometimes and she'll deposit her paycheck but i don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money "
1063,510.1,Farrah,,,"um i guess so but i don't i still don't understand why my answer is wrong well it's not wrong but i'm just wanting you to look at it and different views so in one week that might be a lot of money but when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money "
1065,510.1,Farrah,,,"i mean i guess so because i don't have a job and so like so i don't really get like you know for grownups and and how much money they have um "
1067,510.1,Farrah,,,"but but i actually i was talking about like my answer to the question because cuz i i wrote that let me see what did i circle okay i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely like i don't get why is that a wrong answer "
1070,510.1,Oliver,,,"but the microscope is a machine um yeah "
1078,510.1,Farrah,,,"um i mean i guess i mean i guess cuz you're you you did tell me like i hear what you're saying like they sent i sent this lunar orbiter um but what okay i had it's me student i have the same answer as savannha right um cuz i looked at the the the story and i looked at the question and the question says what equipment did scientists use so i was like looking and to discover the water i was like you know i was i was looking at the um story to for for equipment and look for like i'm looking for water yeah i did the same thing and i was like okay a microscope is like a tool and tool is like equipment and they said that they they use it to look for the water and so yeah that's the same "
1082,510.1,Chris,,,"um yeah i went to nasa with my dad and so i know a lot about this stuff too in space like the astronauts need oxygen tanks and they need masks and they need suits too yes they do "
1084,510.1,Luis,,,"um i can read it "
1087,510.1,Luis,,,"okay um that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely oh yeah that's where you that's where you got your answer student and student "
1090,510.1,Luis,,,"um um yeah like on a car "
1093,510.1,Luis,,,"okay i'm a little bit but i just looked at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so um i just want to say thanks for for coming to our class and really taking some time to listen to all of our ideas because sometimes the teachers don't always listen to everything that we have to say and trying to help us with a question "
1100,510.1,Luis,,,"okay well yeah i i can read it i also want to say that i don't think i should be in this class i already know a lot about space "
1103,510.1,Luis,,,"okay okay what did you want me to read "
1107,510.1,Luis,,,"okay i'm walking well i guess i don't really see oxygen tanks in here i was just something i know i know "
1109,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank "
1113,510.1,Chris,,,"i found my answer paragraph one because they were talking about the water there about how there's a lot of water in the craters "
1116,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i found the equipment but it wasn't an aircraft to i found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah "
1118,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so in paragraph three it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1120,510.1,Farrah,,,"because you need a microscope to look at things "
1122,510.1,Farrah,,,"because it's so small "
1125,510.1,Farrah,,,"i don't know "
1131,510.1,Farrah,,,"Okay. let me see you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
1133,510.1,Farrah,,,"it's like really really small "
1135,510.1,Farrah,,,"like not a lot of it maybe "
1138,510.1,Farrah,,,"my mom says it a lot but i i just i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1146,510.1,Farrah,,,"How's the lunar orbiter able to do that. Well, um, they they taught it how to fly and it flew to the moon. "
1150,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah well i know that all that and i know that well i went to nasa with my dad and so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
1159,510.1,Farrah,,,"i'm thinking about okay so what you're saying is that they sent the lunar orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to to look at the water "
1163,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah that's why i said that that the equipment was the microscope um yeah i said that to me and i said i said the same thing that the equipment was the microscope um but i think miss donna saying by the answers in paragraph two and not in paragraph three "
1169,510.1,Luis,,,"and it's kind of confusing and i am sorry to interrupt you but i just saw the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i know this was short but thanks for taking the time to work with us "
1171,510.1,All,,,"thank you okay bye "
1174,510.1,All,,,"okay hey miss teacher so know that class has told you our answers on what do you think "
1176,510.1,All,,,"okay let's see "
1180,510.1,,,,"i feel like i had the right answer i thought i thought "
1183,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i think so i don't even know why i'm in this class because i already know everything about space or "
1185,510.1,Luis,,,"that's cool "
1192,510.1,Chris,,,"in the first paragraph it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be deeper than the polar craters Scientists have found of water can be hmm well i guess because it said that they found evidence about the water that i thought that that meant that they found the water "
1201,310.1,Luis,,"yeah yeah you did a very good job going back and finding the evidence you did a good job ","i'm sure sure sure sure okie oh okay um well i don't see oxygen tanks in here but i know i already know that they need oxygen tanks to breathe in space "
1204,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm okay i'm gonna have to look again "
1206,310.1,Jazmin,,,"excuse me "
1208,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1215,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh oh i didn't even i didn't actually say that they said i just said that they sent a small machine "
1220,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
1223,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah yeah okay um well okay no it wasn't about oxygen it was just about ice and ice and water in this first part "
1225,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so so i guess it wasn't it wasn't "
1229,310.1,Jazmin,,,"is it the one that i said that we were just talking about the lunar orbiter "
1231,310.1,Farrah,,,"it says that you you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight "
1234,310.1,Oliver,,,"That that was my answer. I said that you need a microscope to see, I'm not true. Um, yeah, but our answer was wrong. "
1242,310.1,Oliver,,,"i can read it okay i suppose it's a very small that one "
1245,310.1,Oliver,,,"scientists set up one top of a layer of amount surface let me see oh i don't think i can read it "
1253,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh ok ok ok i see that now oh wow okay i don't sorry to interrupt our class but i just realized it's time for us to go to lunch by i wanted to take thank you for for helping us to understand some of the meanings of some of the words and and really helping all of us kind of use use evidence from the text in our answer and how are you asked us to keep going back to keep reading and look for it "
1255,310.1,All,,,"bye "
1259,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just thinking like i already know like all that there is to know about space so i don't really think i need to be this class "
1268,420.1,Farrah,,"so can we go ahead and look back at the question and i want you to circle or underline two keywords that you think are important in the question ","oh my circle two words right "
1271,420.1,Oliver,,,"Yeah I circled the same one. "
1273,420.1,Chris,,,"oh i did as well "
1277,430.2,Farrah,,"so some of your answers did involve equipment but what what you didn't do is use the word discover ","i just i was just wondering well my answer was wrong "
1281,430.2,Farrah,,,"to be get the microphone because they probably use the microscope to discover i guess i'm still wondering i did "
1288,420.3,Chris,,"and remember your two keywords equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the words discover and equipment ","um well i was like dad took me to nasa and i was thinking while we were there we saw excited to set us basques shoot and stuff like that so i guess i was wondering like it like is that something that is that an answer "
1295,420.2,Luis,,"To discover the water. So would you like to go ahead and start looking back through the passage to see if you can use the word discover and equipment defined your answer. ","yeah i can look "
1300,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i can tell you but it's my for the next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this yeah it was really awesome thank you so much "
1303,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i was gonna say i just wanted to remind class that um my dad is an astronaut "
1307,420.1,Farrah,,"so again let's look back at our question and look for two keywords that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage ","should we should we circle the words this time "
1314,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so basically what i said was i said that okay so i circled water and i circle value "
1318,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so okay i should actually i had a question because i circled valuable and then i also circle evidence but i thought i should circle convincing too "
1321,310.1,Oliver,,"that's a very good point yeah that's a great idea ","oh i think to answer my question "
1323,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so i was just thinking that you could use the water to make a garden on the moon "
1330,420.3,Chris,,"so now that we know the two keywords that we need to look for in our reading passage is evidence and valuable can class look back at the reading passage and underline what you think a good answer would be ","okay so what i circled up all right what i was looking at was i was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts and that was where was that oh yeah in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
1337,420.3,Farrah,,"so student i want you to take a moment and look back at paragraph four where we see the word valuable because we're looking for evidence that water is valuable it's important ","so okay be what i was looking at well basically i was thinking that it's valuable so the stuff that i was focused on like i was doing the reading was i was looking in the past paragraph paragraph six that are making this plan will take a lot of time like i think it would take a long time and i don't think it would be valuable for for a long time you know what i mean i think it would be valuable maybe sure but i don't think it's valuable right now "
1342,420.3,Oliver,,"so let's look look back at paragraph four, and see how, in the future, water would be valuable. Can you do that. ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like making sure that we all felt valued and like also you made sure that we were using evidence really clearly like that we were going back to the text to make sure that's where we brought our evidence so that was really cool thank you so much for working with us "
1345,310.1,Oliver,,"i love that student used the text when she found her answer ","No problem "
1349,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1355,310.1,Luis,,,"i watch a lot of sure sure i watch a lot of youtube videos so i know that astronauts need like um they need oxygen masks and often because there isn't any way to breathe there's no oxygen space and there's no gravity in space so they have to wear these really heavy boots to help them to walk on the moon um and then there's like a space shuttle that takes off but it has like two parts to it and one part falls off and then the other part like shoots them off into space "
1363,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay Okay, because I don't understand why my answer is wrong. so i'll look and see "
1366,420.2,Jazmin,,"i just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me ","okay "
1369,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah about the water "
1371,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i did it's in paragraph 1 it talks about how the scientists found evidence that the water can be found in the crater to really dark craters "
1378,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah i when i looked on and to find the answer and i had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says you'd need scientific to the tool called a microscope to really closely and because a microscope is a tool and like yeah like like a tool is like equipment you know so that's how i got it "
1381,310.1,Farrah,,"i love that you cited where you found it in the text ","yeah yeah cuz that that was the same i had circle too student i had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because they were looking at the water and that's what the question is asking "
1383,420.2,Jazmin,,"did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name so instead of just saying a small machine they called it a microscope ","no sorry i wasn't i was i was reading again i wasn't paying attention "
1385,420.2,Chris,,,"sorry to interrupt i just wanted to say that i know a lot i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
1388,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i can oh yeah sorry student was before student interrupted we were um i was trying to figure out like what was the problem with my answer too cuz i mean an equipment as a tool it's the same thing "
1393,310.1,Farrah,,"And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing. ","great yeah exactly but then so so so what why is my answer wrong "
1397,310.1,Oliver,,"you told me and you gave it to me from the text that a microscope is what is needed to look really really closely ","oh oh okay well then why i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt um it's it's but i was i was looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just i really appreciate how how you like each of us question and and look again and you're also you're really a nice teacher thank you "
1403,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me ms teache while she's thinking i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1407,310.1,Farrah,,,"i guess like i'm when i discover on i was thinking more it's like when you find something i guess "
1410,420.2,Oliver,,"Looking into and finding it for the first time. That's how I would change your answer, just a little bit to make it a little bit more clear now. ","i circled it in the last paragraph but it was just hard student said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me well yeah it's the last the last sentence and the last paragraph "
1418,310.1,Jazmin,,"okay great i'm glad that you had some place that you could reference back to because that's really helpful in showing me that you know where the information came from ","what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
1423,410.2,Jazmin,,"I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text. So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer. ","Okay. oh nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i just have to write the whole stuffer sentence "
1428,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon "
1430,410.2,Luis,,,"well i mean no they didn't use them to discover water on the moon but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon "
1434,410.2,Chris,,,"okay so i saw in the first paragraph where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters um but then i remembered that you told student that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now i'm not really sure you know "
1436,410.2,Chris,,,"i mean i know stuff about speaks to like student i went to nasa so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits but i just don't know which equipment they use to to to find the water or i guess discover water on the moon "
1439,410.2,Chris,,,"uh huh "
1441,410.2,Jazmin,,,"but you said my answer is right my answers in paragraph two "
1444,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said the lunar orbiter because it says and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1446,410.2,Jazmin,,"Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific. ","look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
1449,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay its got look and its got investigate miss victoria "
1451,410.2,Oliver,,,"i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so i'm sorry all but thanks for taking the time to work with us "
1453,410.2,Luis,,,"execuse me ms teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1456,410.2,Luis,,,"sure um what scientists used to discover water on the moon "
1459,410.2,Luis,,,"i might use oxygen tanks to breathe "
1464,420.2,Farrah,,"Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question. ","whispering to herself you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
1470,310.1,Chris,,"student you have found some specific evidence in the text you pulled it right out scientists have found craters full of water on the moon and that is absolutely true and i'm really proud of you for finding that ","yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1473,310.1,Chris,,,"Okay, okay. Yeah. "
1476,310.1,Farrah,,,"in the third paragraph oh ms teacher i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
1478,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah in paragraph three the last one it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1484,310.1,Oliver,,,"did they discover well it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um so i guess they they looked at the water with the microscope "
1487,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog and he's always investigating crimes "
1489,310.1,Jazmin,,,"no no he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people um yeah to kind of find it out "
1492,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah um okay the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface will in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
1495,310.1,Luis,,,"to two pieces of equipment the small machine that student was reading about and then the microscope that student and student were talking about "
1501,310.1,Jazmin,,,"look for clues "
1504,310.1,Farrah,,,"the microscope the microscope "
1506,310.1,Chris,,,"you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits um so yeah it makes sense that they would need other equipment too "
1510,310.1,Oliver,,,"miss miss teacher this is pretty cool i was just looking at the time and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i like how you kept asking me talk talk back after i'm at the tax to try to find that information because i know that i'm student and student know a lot of stuff but then you kept saying us okay well go read back in this part all read back in this part and i think about was helpful to "
1513,310.1,All,,,"okay bye bye "
1516,310.1,Bennett,,,"all right "
1518,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just was gonna say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space "
1520,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah yeah i think i'd be great to help on this question "
1523,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so i think one thing that i thought was really interesting was when i was looking for the for the equipment but to see like how much equipment they have to use it there's a lot of it "
1526,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like you know the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface but they were still able to find it using the microscope "
1529,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i think for me what was most interesting was looking at like was i think the fact that i've not been to nasa a couple of times with my dad and so i was connecting to everything they were saying on because i i had kind of known some of it but not everything "
1532,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess the thing that i had was that i was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong "
1534,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay a lot of it was just like what was really interesting is that like with water you could do like so much magic stuff plant and you do all kinds of stuff with water "
1537,310.1,Luis,,,"hi yeah i was really cool and i think for me like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment they have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it that's really cool "
1541,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah okay so question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1544,310.1,Farrah,,,"I think the questions asking us, okay, so it says... Scientists discovered the water and then like what equipment did they use to do that. "
1547,310.1,Chris,,,"on class because i was just thinking that because i went to nasa and i just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and that wasn't in the reading "
1549,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah like i know they use it but like it wasn't in the reading when i when i read i was wondering like should it have been there you know what i mean "
1552,310.1,Chris,,,"that's a really good question "
1554,310.1,Chris,,,"you could use all of the equipment but like specifically you said to discover so i guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover you'd have to use something else right "
1559,310.1,Chris,,,"and i would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water and i just want to say that i think it's important for me with the microscope but unfortunately we just have to go to lunch to wanted to thank you so much for working with us but but we have to go look "
1562,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay i'm sorry "
1565,310.1,Jazmin,,,"in the first sentence in paragraph 2 it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1568,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i can see how the small machine or i guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like i could see how that was used to discover so the water you see is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close so i guess i guess what i was thinking is like you can't see the water without the microscope so like how could you discover it "
1570,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so what i was thinking just like on the question that you're asking is like you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it you can detect water using other tools "
1572,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so i guess i wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you you could use so like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick you know what i mean like it could be sensors it could be other things "
1577,310.1,Jazmin,,,"he said that i support my answer right so okay yes here's how i would support my answer so the question was what equipment it scientists use to discover the water i was thinking that the word discovers like the word investigate so like it seemed like the best answer was like what was the word that matched the question right and even though you might use the microscope study the water like you use the lunar orbiter to discover the water "
1581,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah actually okay that does mean a lot of sense i still like i guess i'm not like 100 sure but i do understand like that that matches the word keyword "
1586,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i guess okay you said what they talked about so not like what we were saying You know, I guess not. Like, there really isn't other. It's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text. "
1597,310.1,Jazmin,,,"we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to take a moment and i really wanted to thank you because there's a couple things that you were doing that like really helped us understand like the question and get to the answer first that you've really helped us to clarify like how you were asked like you know the ways that you asked us about our thinking and like what we were saying and like in order to like use evidence to justify our answers like you really gave us a chance to explain it and that was pretty cool because like we don't always get to like explain what we were thinking and also that you really value our thining even though it looks like lunar orbiter the right answer like you really valued what we were thinking about ans where they were coming from and i also you know like we're really beginning to ask us like you know like what we needed to work on and like we're giving ideas for how to improve it so like that was really cool to be able to begin that but especially to like be looking at all that stuff so thank you so much "
1599,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sure okay so i had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely you know like at the water "
1601,310.1,Oliver,,,"i said the same thing "
1603,310.1,Oliver,,,"sorry sorry "
1605,310.1,Farrah,,,"i don't know but but it says tt says that they put they had a microscope in the story "
1609,310.1,Oliver,,"oh i see what you're talking about ","it's not that i liked her answer you know it's like like i had the same answer as her or like she had the same answer as me you know like we had the same answer but it doesn't like like i had her answer you know "
1612,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i mean yeah what i liked about you know like my answer um which student had the same one true um was that the question asked her about um let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool you need a scientific tool yeah so like that's a tool and equipment is a tool so like that's why i think i think we had a good answer "
1616,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah it was like okay so the scientists found found water in the crater so like that was my answer "
1621,310.1,Farrah,,,"i don't know they found water deep in the craters they sent a machine to look for ice i don't know i don't know if it's wet or dry excuse me "
1623,310.1,Farrah,,,"i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
1626,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't know either if the moon is wet or dry "
1630,310.1,Luis,,,"well i know i know a lot about space like and i know a lot about the moon like i know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and i know that you can't breathe there's no oxygen on the moon um and i know that um that so they have to wear like space suits so that they can breathe on the moon and then they can walk on the moon and i know that they found some water on mars but but i don't know if i don't know about the water on the moon yet "
1632,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah sure okay scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within "
1635,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yes sorry okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
1638,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah we know that the moon is dry okay i get it "
1640,310.1,Chris,,,"see what you're saying okay okay yeah um well cuz you know i went to nasa and so i know that the scientists like they use a lot of like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff and so i didn't know that it was like really dry there "
1642,310.1,Chris,,,"it's really cool "
1645,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sure sure sure okay um okay we're still in number three yeah oh cuz this is where my answer came from the water the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah that was my answer "
1648,310.1,Jazmin,,,"but then why is my answer wrong "
1651,310.1,Jazmin,,,"then i don't know why my answer is wrong because i said a small machine and they asked about equipment "
1655,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate orbiter "
1659,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me maam "
1662,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry yeah i know that was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i really i really do appreciate how you you took time with every every single one of us to kind of like you know help us to to keep looking looking at the text and and you're really patient thank you bye "
1667,310.1,Luis,,,"hi hi hi hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1669,310.1,Luis,,,"um oh i guess okay "
1673,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i think that's why that's why the teacher asked us to come over here for for you to talk to us about our answers yeah that's what they said um yeah yeah "
1675,310.1,Farrah,,,"uh huh "
1677,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm i'm trying to remember i don't remember what i put let me just see because i circled it on my tablet oh yeah i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1680,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
1682,310.1,Oliver,,,"on well i circled the same thing as student on the bottom of the page we i didn't like circle it because she circled it but we had we had the same answer what i circled the same thing um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1684,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i it's meet student here i just want to say that i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
1688,310.1,Farrah,,,"but the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding Okay. "
1693,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah yeah ah i found that in the first part yeah and the first part of it cuz it talked to all about the water in the first part of it "
1698,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah that's why i it circled it says equipment you know like that's equipment on tool and equipment that's like the same thing yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool a scientific tool so that's equipment "
1702,310.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits a lot a lot of different equipment "
1704,310.1,Chris,,,"right yeah "
1706,310.1,Chris,,,"ah i'm not sure "
1708,310.1,Jazmin,,,"me what do i think "
1710,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a machine to discover water on the moon "
1712,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i guess put more of the question in my answer so i couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon "
1714,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess so "
1716,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
1718,310.1,Jazmin,,,"it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1720,310.1,Jazmin,,,"a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1725,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry i looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but i really appreciate you took so much time to really help us and ask us questions i must look back at the text again to try to find our answers um thank you "
1728,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good how are you "
1730,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer "
1732,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i didn't i already submitted it i don't remember what i wrote down um let me see if it's on my slide "
1734,310.1,Luis,,,"um no i corrected that let me see i'm looking to see if i can find it "
1739,420.1,Oliver,,"I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth. Okay. ","i'm scared right now we're looking at keywords in the question "
1745,420.1,Farrah,,"but i want you to look at question number one and see if you can find a keyword or two keywords that are important that might help you answer the question ","i did and i already corrected my answer too but the keyword that i found was discover and equipment "
1749,420.1,Oliver,,,"i picked out equipment and discover too equipment and water i said equipment of water "
1751,420.1,Luis,,,"i said equipment discover and water "
1755,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah when you asked us all a say or answer so first i'm not i heard hurts and it's the same thing that i found too "
1760,420.1,Farrah,,,"well because i was looking at the word equipment and i remembered in science class miss smith always calls a microscope equipment when she says we're going to use the equipment today and also for discover i think that's like you know when you're looking at something you discover it and so i saw that they were talking about finding the water and looking at it in paragraph three and the microscope which is "
1762,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh well kinda cuz yeah i'm in the same science classes her so when it said scientific tool i was thinking about how we use tools for different things and so i thought equipment and tool was the same thing so that's why i set the microscope "
1764,420.1,Oliver,,,"it means like when you find something "
1768,420.1,Oliver,,,"uh huh "
1770,420.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mask and suits "
1774,420.1,Jazmin,,,"uh huh okay um "
1778,420.1,Jazmin,,,"no i don't remember Oh, oh, it's called a lunar orbiter. "
1782,420.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me it's i'm sorry it's been a short time but it's time for us to go to lunch now "
1784,420.1,Oliver,,,"thank you okay bye "
1789,420.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer and so i know mind correct now "
1795,420.1,Farrah,,,"you had told me before that that the microscope looked at the the the water but but it didn't discover the water so then i was trying to find another machine in the story "
1798,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh i couldn't figure out what was wrong because i thought the microscope was right "
1802,420.1,Chris,,,"when it said that the water was deep in the craters that that meant was like a poll that was really deep in there was a lot of water but then you had told me that deep in the craters didn't mean like like like a pool but just made like really low so and and i realized there wasn't any equipment in in paragraph one okay "
1806,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh nevermind i didn't realize you were you were gonna read that part nevermind "
1808,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i changed my answer too "
1810,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i added the name of the machine i said nasa some to small machine called a lunar orbiter "
1812,420.1,Jazmin,,,"it was in the same sentence as the one that i i had my my first answer in paragraph to um but i just added the name of the machine "
1816,420.1,Luis,,,"Okay. "
1818,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah i'm not sure it's just that i didn't say enough "
1821,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah for for me that's why i was i was confused because i was looking for water in the story and so i didn't see the pardon about paragraph two about the ice cuz i was looking for the word water "
1824,420.1,Chris,,,"you know teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits "
1826,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah um but i didn't i didn't know anything about the water "
1828,420.1,Chris,,,"well i mean i remember we learned that in science class but i wasn't thinking about it i was thinking more about like the just water water you know when i was reading i was looking for the word "
1832,520.1,Oliver,,"okay so whenever we're reading we want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question so as we're reading if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking ","reach every reader thank you it's time for us to go to lunch must go but thank you for for all i guess it's telling us what we're looking for question to really try to understand what it's asking and not just look up the keywords because i guess that's what me and student and student detlef look at some keywords but we didn't really understand "
1836,520.1,Chris,,,"okay thank you okay bye hi "
1840,520.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about speed "
1842,520.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah sure "
1844,520.1,Farrah,,,"can you repeat the question please "
1846,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah um so i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1849,520.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1853,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah sure this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
1856,520.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah sure these ice deposits are very small "
1859,520.1,Luis,,,"i'm not really sure "
1862,520.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i know a lot about that equipment um they they use okay so because there's no oxygen in space they use like oxygen tanks and they use like i'm their space suits and they use a rocket like to get up into space you know like as a rocket goes straight up like all way into the way into the orbit of space "
1865,520.1,Jazmin,,,"excuse me but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1867,520.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why is my answer is wrong "
1869,520.1,Jazmin,,,"that was farrah's answer mine was about the small machine i thought that that was be the right answer "
1872,520.1,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
1874,520.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry what's the answer "
1879,520.1,Chris,,,"well i know the answer cuz cuz you just told me it is but um i guess i don't know i mean i went to nasa and i know that there's lots of equipment and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and like lots lots of stuff like that lots of equipment because i'm using the word in the question lots of equipment like that "
1883,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah i think you're saying like that yeah so i know a lot of equipment but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water so i was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water "
1886,520.1,Oliver,,,"yeah cuz student answer had machine in it but my answer and um farrahs answer well our answer had a scientific tool and and and scientific tool is is equipment too "
1889,520.1,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch i know it was really really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer right class okay so thank you and bye "
1892,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i i think i need to be in this class because i know all about space "
1898,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i said basically it would be a scientific tool called a microscope "
1901,520.1,Farrah,,,"they're looking for the water "
1904,520.1,Oliver,,,"Yeah, I said the same thing. "
1908,520.1,Farrah,,,"water "
1912,520.1,Chris,,,"um so i said that scientists found craters full of water "
1918,310.1,Jazmin,,"you all refered back to the text ","i'm still looking like why my answer is wrong "
1920,430.2,Jazmin,,"so your answer they did send a small machine but the question was asking for specifics so a little more in depth so could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment and what that piece of equipment's name was ","it was the lunar orbiter "
1924,420.2,Chris,,"you just needed to go just a little bit more in depth right ","um well i i don't really know which equipment it might be because i just i think there's a lot of craters there's a lots of water "
1929,420.2,Luis,,,"while i was just gonna say like i know that like scientists use a lot of you know equipment so like i said oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
1932,420.2,Luis,,,"um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1935,420.2,Luis,,,"Well, I saw on you know Orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment. I saw like in the reading. "
1939,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i didn't really think about it because i haven't really read about microscopes before i'm not totally sure like did they use that like which one they use "
1942,420.2,Chris,,,"so we were talking and i was saying oh so like i was saying i know that like because i went to nasa with my dad so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i really think that's the answer "
1948,420.2,Chris,,,"to read aloud "
1951,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay i'm reading it right now well chris's meeting unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go it just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
1953,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i've kind of already like i know all about space so i don't think i really even the be in this class "
1956,420.2,Chris,,,"oh no i was just "
1959,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1963,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
1965,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay so they use like they use oxygen tanks and they use masks and like they must have us rocket fuel and like rocket ships and all that kind of stuff you know "
1971,310.1,Luis,,"thank you for that that's awesome prior knowledge about pieces of equipment they use student ","Okay. Um, let's see. okay nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar or will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a barge pole or create these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 30 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
1974,310.1,Farrah,,,"just wondering i'm still confused why my answer is wrong "
1979,310.1,Farrah,,,"He was looking for microscopes. "
1983,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i have that same answer "
1995,410.2,Chris,,"maybe be a little more specific with that question right so looking for a specific piece of equipment which one which piece of equipment helps them search for water okay so all those facts are right that you class had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay ","so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like you know scientists use like oh suits masks like stuff like that so i was thinking maybe that was part of the answer "
2001,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
2005,410.2,Luis,,,"Yeah. Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon. "
2008,420.3,Luis,,"So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called? ","wow let's see only equipment in paragraph two is the lunar orbiter "
2010,420.3,Luis,,,"um it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits so is the lunar orbiter the right answer "
2013,530.1,Luis,,"exactly student so how's your thinking changed since the very beginning ","i'm not totally sure i that i'm like looking at the paper it says that it's like the lunar orbiter is in paragraph two but i guess not totally sure why that's the answer "
2017,530.1,Chris,,,"fortunately all happy to watch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us in particular and really wanted to just like taking the time to help us understand the question and make sure that we were reviewing like that and then you're asking us to make sure that we really like you know like we really thought about our eater so thank you so much for working with us it was hi "
2019,530.1,Chris,,,"hi the teacher said that you were going to give us some feedback on our our answers to the question "
2021,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me "
2023,530.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
2025,530.1,Luis,,,"well i mean not like everything but i know a lot a lot a lot about space "
2028,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah i think yeah i think that makes sense okay yeah okay "
2030,530.1,Oliver,,,"i can read the question if you want me to "
2032,530.1,Oliver,,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2035,530.1,Farrah,,,"On. Yeah, I was. I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water. So I have both of those. So I don't know why my answers wrong. "
2038,530.1,Farrah,,,"um okay "
2040,530.1,Jazmin,,,"a better word "
2042,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand because it says oh what did they use to discover the water and so in paragraph two they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits and we we learned in science class that ice and water are the same thing ice is just frozen water right "
2044,530.1,Jazmin,,,"okay let me see "
2047,530.1,Jazmin,,,"number three okay i'm not really sure i don't know "
2050,530.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
2052,530.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that they use the scientists use a lot of equipments like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of equipment like that "
2054,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah i went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff "
2057,530.1,Chris,,,"okay okay cool yeah i can tell you all all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard people think they're they're covered in like i'm like just the same kind of metal as an airplane but they have to have thermal tiles on them and that when they go like way up into the orbit you know it gets really really hot so the type of aluminum that's on the spaceship it protects it "
2059,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
2063,530.1,All,,,"yeah sure the question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon oh excuse me student i i'm sorry to interrupt i was i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you listen to everybody's ideas and what they had to say well i hope that we see you again bye "
2065,530.1,Chris,,,"hi glad to see you "
2068,530.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna share that i already kind of know all about space i don't really even need to be in this class you know what i mean "
2071,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um well i think yeah like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff so student then you should just like even i mean you should just share with us what you think like your background "
2074,530.1,Chris,,,"well i think it was informative because i realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water "
2080,530.1,Oliver,,,"well that's a great question i think what was interesting was mostly the fact that i'm like well i guess if you think it's like i thought it was interesting like the article that they talked about like you know what i mean like these different things that you eventually do on the moon and it made me think about like wanting to be like maybe i want to be an astronaut like luis's dad "
2083,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah i know all about it "
2086,530.1,Luis,,,"um yeah like there's a few things that i should are that i've learned from like i learned that like well like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that "
2089,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i learned about how you use microscopes different ways i think that the thing i want you to the question i have is like why my answer is wrong "
2094,530.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i thought the equipment i think that the microscope i agree with student "
2096,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i think microscope as well and it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading "
2099,530.1,Chris,,,"well okay so one thing that i noticed is i been to nasa with my dad and i love space and i noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean so i was wondering if they use that for this too "
2103,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter and i think that that's like because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to thank you for working with us so much and i think we'll see you again so thank you so much bye "
2106,530.1,Oliver,,,"we're good we're excited to see you "
2108,530.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i was just gonna say that like i already know all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to even be "
2113,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh so i think it's the microscope "
2115,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah because you need it look really closely "
2118,530.1,Farrah,,,"good question he said in the reading that paragraph three that the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you will look straight at it so you have to use a microscope want to see it "
2121,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah "
2125,530.1,Farrah,,,"we plant cells in science class Yeah. "
2128,530.1,Oliver,,,"um so my answer was basically that i had i you know i circled the same thing as as student and i think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover "
2132,530.1,Oliver,,,"i'm not sure like what would i add Oh, well, yeah, I think the same reason like cuz they said it in the in the reading. They were like, You have to. Yeah. Like Farrah said you have to use like a microscope to see them microscopic particles "
2135,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i wasn't sure like why my answer was wrong "
2139,530.1,Jazmin,,,"like what is the machine "
2141,530.1,Jazmin,,,"small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter "
2143,530.1,Jazmin,,,"sorry the machine is called a lunar orbiter "
2148,530.1,Jazmin,,,"well i was wondering because when i think about it i think it you know they use the lunar orbiter and they don't really talk about like having class on board they had to use some kind of tool so i guess they could they have used it seems like they use the lunar orbiter the to find the water in your enemy and then they studied with the microscope "
2151,530.1,Chris,,,"i don't know is it not a good answer "
2157,530.1,Chris,,,"Oh, I guess, like, I guess I would have to say a piece of equipment. right like not is that one my answer was what okay so what i was gonna say is that basically you know like i went to nasa with my dad and when we when we saw that scientists use masks and oxygen tanks and stuff and i was thinking that was missing fromt he reading "
2164,530.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us and like in particular it was really cool how you asked us to connect like our our responses to like our experiences and like share with you what we thought about them beyond just our answers and that was really cool because it helped us to both like clarify what we were kind of thinking a little bit and then also was like helping us to think about like what kind of evidence like maybe we should do so like i think class by like talking to class you asked class like you know what i mean like who should like who should talk and like you can share and that was really cool well thank you so much for that "
2166,530.1,Chris,,,"hi "
2169,530.1,Oliver,,,"hi mister a hi mister a "
2172,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me um but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
2177,530.1,Luis,,,"Um, i okay well i have to look back and see um i'm not really sure i'm come back to me because now i gotta read it and i gotta look look for "
2184,410.2,Oliver,,"so i think the one that stands out to me the most is going to be you student i noticed that your response didn't tell me anything about what went on in the text ","microscope that was that was my answer it was the same one i savannas but like it's only cuz you asked her first if you would have asked me first then maybe student would have said i have the same answer as student right yeah so it's the microscope "
2187,410.2,Oliver,,,"um i'm not sure um i have to read it through again okay i see something in paragraph two "
2189,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah right i see that too i see that too "
2191,410.2,Jazmin,,,"mister a my answer came from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2195,410.2,Jazmin,,,"Well as sentences NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that this specific machine is the Lunar Orbiter. "
2198,430.2,Jazmin,,"that's very good that's very good so right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct but if i was only reading the answers to this specific question i might not have the context needed to know that so by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about ","oh ok ok i think i think i understand that "
2202,430.2,Luis,,,"oh no i read the whole thing i was gonna say the same thing that student said like when you're asked me to look for equipment i found two pieces of equipment the lunar orbiter but also the microscope that that student was talking about "
2207,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah well i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff "
2209,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah oh yeah me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits it was the coolest ever "
2211,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah "
2217,410.2,h,,"but for this one answer wasn't quite there is because we needed to focus more on that equipment than what the equipment was finding ","um yeah you said that i was right on when i was talking about the water but i didn't talk about the equipment right "
2222,410.2,Oliver,,"i see where you're coming from by the way that you answered that and you offer a lot of insight but it's still wrong and it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at we want to know about this equipment so we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically ","okay okay yeah i just want to say i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch i know this has been really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to really help us look at all the different words in the question and the words and the answer and give class like some positive feedback that seemed really nice thank you "
2224,410.2,All,,,"bye "
2226,410.2,All,,,"good morning good morning "
2228,410.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
2230,410.2,Luis,,,"how okay "
2235,410.2,Farrah,,,"so i said i'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what "
2238,310.1,Oliver,,"absolutely very good student i like your use of detail there i think that definitely gives a lot to whoever's reading that answer to include them in i think that's very good ","yeah sure okay the question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2241,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i mean i had that same as student because i circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and i i circled the last sentence do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2244,420.2,Oliver,,"so if we were able to come to that same sort of answer but give more details you might be able to better inform your reader who's me the teacher ","oh yeah yeah yeah i can see that "
2246,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
2250,410.2,Farrah,,"If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space. ","um okay yeah cause i know we're supposed to pull something out of the story and they talk about the microscope and they talk about looking at water really closely on the moon so yeah "
2255,410.2,Farrah,,"yes yes they do they absolutely do but i think that answer might leave out some important parts of the story you give really good strong details on that very specific part So we got to make sure that when we're answering. We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were. ","okay "
2258,410.2,Chris,,,"well i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits went to nasa "
2263,410.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah sorry i've never actually i didn't see it on so i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon "
2266,430.2,Chris,,"Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there. So in the article. Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water. ","oh i thought it was a lot of water "
2270,430.2,Chris,,,"what equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them yeah "
2276,530.1,Oliver,,"so how can we approach that question a little differently now that you've looked at it ","i guess they used o equipment well i don't know i don't know what the what the equipment is that they use Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later. "
2282,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
2287,530.1,Luis,,,"okay so um i heard that you when you're talking to student and student and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story so i took out the oxygen tanks and i just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode "
2293,420.2,Luis,,"i think we can be a little more specific in your response so you said oxygen tanks and yeah absolutely they're gonna use oxygen tanks there could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that nasa used in this article to help discover water on the moon ","okay um well um i know it's not the microscope because you already told them that they were wrong so i'm the only other one that i see only in the first three paragraphs right we're only looking at the beginning part of the article "
2295,420.2,Luis,,,"okay um so the only other thing that i can see as the lunar orbiter "
2298,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i'm still confused i am yeah "
2302,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the answer i mean i use i said i'm not too small machine but i'm in this class so why is my answer Yeah. Yeah, you did. "
2306,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i think that fast the probably the one that i was talking about i guess ah so what i think we could do to improve is maybe make your answer be a little more specific so that way when i read it i know exactly which piece of equipment you're talking about i don't have to leave things to be ambiguous does that make sense yeah so i just i just got to add the name that i sent a small machine called lunar orbiter okay "
2312,430.2,Luis,,"Include in our answer multiple pieces of the equipment we heard about microscopes and we've heard about lunar orbiters ","um yeah so i felt like that's what i did i took off the oxygen tanks and so i said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one but you said that's not i wasn't i wasn't right "
2319,410.2,Luis,,"something that's right on the cusp of being just what i'm looking for in this case student was a little too vague ","Okay, so I just got to add the names like how Jazmin did a lot of equipment like arbiters and microscopes i think i think that "
2326,410.2,Luis,,,"Oh man, that's like a lot of words, you're saying we got to write all that down. "
2328,420.2,Chris,,"a lot of words can seem tough but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way that way you don't get any confusion so they know you're just as smart as i know you are ","you know i've heard that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
2339,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay um so like you told student and student that they had to have more more more details and that there's two answers so um but then like even more details about the question who okay um so i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close on so if i was going to say ah i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope or a lunar orbiter to look really closely i'm not sure "
2344,410.2,Farrah,,"We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon. This is how you go about doing it. We're talking about someone that's already done. We're talking about NASA specifically right ","Oh hey, why would we change it to start with NASA "
2352,420.2,Oliver,,"right we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically so you could say nasa or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those i think would convey your meeting ","okay okay that's good i think okay i'll try it out um okay scientists use a microscope ah lunar orbiter talk really closely "
2357,430.2,Oliver,,"now that's true you do use a microscope to look really close but remember this article and this question are both asking about the discovery of water so maybe instead of focusing on the looking really close we can change the end of our answer to say to find or to discover water ","class you know i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch "
2361,430.2,Oliver,,,"thank you but mr obama had a whole i wanted to say but i was less than i and i i really appreciate how you you help us keep thinking about the evidence from the text and and putting the details from the question and our answer i feel like that's something i can do next time ma'am it's still hard i don't i couldn't figure out how to do it but i mean i guess like i know that's what i'm supposed to do "
2363,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye see you next time "
2366,430.2,Unclear,,,"hi "
2369,430.2,Farrah,,,"um so i was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water "
2372,430.2,Farrah,,,"um well like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water "
2375,430.2,Luis,,,"i'm not totally sure i know i know i know i know i know "
2377,430.2,Luis,,,"alright so here's the thing so um i don't think i should be with this class because i had i always get my answers right like when i'm when i'm talking about space because i know all about space already so i don't even have to be here "
2379,430.2,Luis,,,"well i guess i didn't really read that part because i didn't think i had to read the part cuz i already know man "
2381,430.2,Oliver,,,"was um was a microscope attached to like to the astronaut "
2383,430.2,Chris,,,"um so i guess like i kind of know a lot about nasa and i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so i don't know i think that oliver's guess is pretty good like you could look and say like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit "
2385,430.2,Jazmin,,,"what i said was it it was a small machine "
2387,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well i guess if i look at it like it says like the lunar orbiter right that they sent up in space "
2389,430.2,Farrah,,,"um so what i'm confused though is is my answer wrong or is jazmin's answer wrong i said the microscope and student said the lunar orbiter "
2393,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so am i like more right because i was saying about the orbiter and like student is like sort of right but you know i'm like wondering "
2400,430.2,Jazmin,,,"i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go but i just wanted to say to you because i know we just met you but i wanted to thank you because you were really warm and positive with us and the thing is is like sometimes we like really drive science teacher crazy and like i feel like you were so patient with us and you've really listened to our answers and you really helped us to like hear each other's answers because we don't always pay attention to like each other so i just wanted to say thank you "
2403,430.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay i'm good "
2405,430.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be on this class i already know all about space "
2408,430.2,Luis,,,"i guess i'll "
2412,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2416,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon right so if we look at the passage we need to start comprehend here here's what and this goes to all you class right so i'm going to give you a really quick reading strategy to help you out all right "
2427,510.1,Farrah,,"when you read something it's a three step process when you're trying to answer a question And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again. Right. So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question. Does that make sense. ","yeah right i did it Okay. um but i mean i got my answer right from the text do you see in paragraph three the last sentence you you that's where it got it okay i circled that "
2430,510.1,Farrah,,,"well i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2434,510.1,Farrah,,,"cuz cuz in science class the teachers always like okay we're going to use microscopes today let's get off the equipment and so so i know that microscopes or equipment on and then the question asks about discovering the water and in in this paragraph it says that you'd need this to look at the water so "
2438,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh you need this to look at the water "
2442,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh no it is to "
2444,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay "
2447,510.1,Oliver,,,"well okay so yeah cuz i i i kind of had the same thinking i said man i was like okay a scientific tool is equipment on the water okay but yeah i see what you're saying about looking it's not the same as discovering okay "
2450,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah i'm feeling good i know a lot about this stuff "
2455,510.1,Chris,,,"oh well i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits Oh, text "
2458,420.2,Farrah,,"yeah so remember that's what we're trying to get the information pro is what ring correct ","yeah right right okay oh okay mister mister fortune i see on there's a small machine one in paragraph to "
2461,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay i found out to it's a lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph "
2466,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm a fan for machine Oh, the Lunar Orbiter. "
2470,420.1,Oliver,,"so if you read the text and you read the question what words are kind of synonyms for each other ","i'm okay equipment is machine "
2473,420.1,Jazmin,,,"That equipment is machine. "
2478,420.2,Jazmin,,"so maybe next time when you're doing that you could you could be more specific you said nasa sent a small machine but you could clarify your statement a little bit more right well that'd be a good strategy ","yeah yeah i can add i can add a little bit more "
2480,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
2486,510.1,Luis,,"when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking ","okay why equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2490,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i said all scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank "
2493,510.1,Luis,,,"i guess "
2496,510.1,Luis,,"You the strategy I talked about ","oh oh you mean like reread it again yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i already know the answer student student said it angers intended and deaths at it "
2498,510.1,Luis,,,"the lunar orbiter "
2501,510.1,Oliver,,,"no problem all excuse me mr fortune arm i just looked at the clock and i'm it's time for us to lunch um but thanks for working with us we'll see you next time "
2508,510.1,Luis,,,"it was really good we got to chocolate chip cookies i got this all figured out figured out so good now "
2510,510.1,Luis,,,"okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
2513,510.1,Luis,,,"i read the question i read the story you said read the question read the story and then "
2518,510.1,Luis,,,"okay so i found the answer unless story um it says that water can be while it has water can be broken down into two parts but i wrote it in my own words water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we learned that those are valuable and finance class "
2524,420.1,Chris,,"What specifically remember post to a look at what the questions asking and what the text is saying what specifically ","okay i also kind of like student i definitely feel like i knocked it out the park this time because last time you said i didn't have anything about the equipment but this one is asking about water and valuable and so i think i answered it and i got it from the story "
2528,420.1,Chris,,,"ok ok so here we go um water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore valuable "
2533,420.1,Chris,,,"ok ok i guess i mean i guess since you're asking me it must be one part of it okay "
2538,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i'm still confused cuz i thought chris's answer was a good answer and my answer is a good answer but you're probably going to tell me that my answer is not a good answer till "
2543,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
2545,420.1,Jazmin,,,"the thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen "
2547,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh there's more "
2550,420.1,Oliver,,,"i mean was different from there so i don't know they said yeah but i said no i said no it's not ready yet "
2554,420.1,Oliver,,,"no i set up a water it's not ready yet cuz that's what i got from the story "
2559,420.1,Oliver,,,"i'll pass that says i just kind of take a long time Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable. So I said no. Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready. "
2564,420.1,Oliver,,,"Other ways "
2568,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths where it was like not for a long time because it said making this plan will take a lot of time and money "
2577,410.1,Luis,,"right and again like he said you know that's one way to look at it but the question is actually specifically pointing toward what's the potential value ","um yeah we found some stuff okay so um i took luis's idea about the hydrogen and oxygen because it says that they could breed the oxygen and also it says oxygen hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel "
2580,410.1,Oliver,,,"far tomorrow "
2583,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i said that "
2587,410.1,Luis,,,"rocket fuel all "
2589,410.1,Oliver,,,"i can help help cars malls own could be stopped for spacecraft it could be a gas station "
2592,410.1,Farrah,,,"i thought class said everything "
2595,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah student student so "
2597,410.1,Oliver,,,"with the right "
2605,410.1,Chris,,,"okay um you know i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
2607,410.1,Chris,,,"oh "
2609,410.1,Chris,,,"hey oh yeah that was it "
2615,410.1,Oliver,,,"That makes the high. Yeah, it makes sense. I think about. We all felt like we did at this time, but you're like, Hey, go back again. it's like "
2617,510.1,Oliver,,"if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over ","yeah yeah okay well thanks for helping us i do appreciate that you you had us keep going back to the question and back to that question back to the question and back to the text back to the text to find evidence "
2621,520.1,All,,"thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ","okay bye "
2623,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i kind of know all about space already like i don't think i need to even in this "
2628,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so basically so what i circled in the text was that the the microscope know what i mean like that the microscope was the equipment that they used to study the ice basic "
2632,520.1,Oliver,,,"i pretty much use the same thing like i looked at the third paragraph and that was where i found like what i was mostly looking "
2635,520.1,Chris,,,"so basically what i looked at what's up well actually i guess i didn't really circle well no i looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water "
2638,520.1,Jazmin,,,"that the first sentence or two and i was like i basically was looking at like the small and i just want like i still don't understand why my answers "
2644,520.1,Luis,,,"um you know i actually was thinking about all that i knew about space and i kind of knew that you know the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i guess i just thought like i kind of know this though i mostly just wrote down on the side "
2655,420.1,Luis,,"i love how student student student and student were able to look specifically in the text and that's a good skill And our question even asked us to circle evidence in the text, but even when questions don't prompt us to do that. The first thing is to always find evidence in the text. What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word. ","um yeah so i'm i'm thinking from how you said it that discovery like it's a question of like how how do we discover how did we find "
2658,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i basically had the same thing i said discover and like it was something that like how you know it made me like how stuff "
2661,420.1,Farrah,,,"um i actually i was thinking based on what you said i was thinking maybe it was discovered well so i'm still kind of not totally understanding but i think i'm beginning to understand that that maybe the microscope was you to to discover the world like if that's a keyword maybe it's a different piece of equipment "
2664,420.1,Chris,,,"well i just i i kind of like okay i was thinking about out my dad took me to nasa and when we went like you know what even said like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i was like how could they how could they not use i was just wondering like you know what i mean "
2670,420.1,Jazmin,,,"you're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the for the first time "
2674,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um it was really cool to have you like helping us so thank you so much "
2680,530.1,Farrah,,"about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking can you go back to that ","oh well so basically like okay so at first i thought like okay you're gonna discovers you have use the microscope to see because we know that the ice is microscopic so if i figured well you'd have use a microscope to to discover but it sounds like we can i think you use the word or it sounds like we get it or that that they they use like other and it sounds also like because we don't see the feeling that you know what i mean that that the astronauts are on the lunar orbiter they must have some kind of other do you you know you know what i mean "
2682,530.1,Luis,,,"well i was gonna remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut so that's pretty "
2686,530.1,Jazmin,,,"so basically nothing stops and it's not like i shouldn't do that it's the lunar orbiter that's the small "
2696,430.2,Chris,,"So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine. I need to dig a little deeper. And what else does the passage. Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a ","it says lunar orbit "
2698,430.2,Chris,,,"the scientists use the lunar orbiter "
2704,430.2,Chris,,,"Yeah, they're using. I mean, they're using a bunch of "
2707,430.2,Oliver,,,"like the microscope is helping the scientists to it's helping them study the water like after its bow right so they they use it sounds like the lunar orbiter to find it and then they they use the microscope to study the microscopic water right "
2712,510.1,Oliver,,"whatever you think it's okay if your response hasn't changed it's okay if it has changed i'm just curious what you all are thinking so take a moment before our conversation i thought this and after our conversation i thought this remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword ","A, keyword, keyword "
2715,510.1,Farrah,,"keyword to help us and to answer the question ","so the keyword was up okay so it was like discussed right so it was equipment but it was also discussed "
2727,420.2,Farrah,,"always find and identify a keyword so you really understand what you're looking for and go back in the text However, we also have to use specific text evidence and just like Jazmin learned I can't just stop at NASA said a small machine, right. keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer and be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text student ","yeah so we have to go to our next class but before we go to class i really wanted to bring up like first up i really wanted to you for helping us to your meaning of the word discover like at first it was a little music i think for us but i think that we all understand now like basically what it means and why it was so and then you help this like use evidence from the text to like you know answer our question that we made sure we were looking back at what we read and then even beyond that like you really asked us to use like like how what are the key was behind you know what i mean our answer so we like i think class understands clearly "
2729,420.2,Jazmin,,,"hi "
2732,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay well so i found the like microscope to be really important because like that's something that like the astronauts would have to look like if they wanted to see the water "
2734,420.2,Luis,,,"okay so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space there's no way that i got any of these questions wrong "
2736,420.2,Luis,,,"well so my answer was like they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space "
2738,420.2,Luis,,,"well i knew it already "
2741,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so i think that he's right about equipment but i don't think that like i don't think he was i don't think he was reading ma'am i think she was just saying stuff like that he knew like i looked at it and i said like i think it's a microscope because how could you even see the water if you couldn't see the fragment like if you didn't use a microscope you know what i mean like i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2745,420.2,Chris,,,"like okay so like i went to nasa like with my dad and like i like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what student was saying like i saw it in the exhibits like i i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff "
2748,420.2,Chris,,,"ah um sort of "
2751,420.3,Jazmin,,"okay student i would like you to go back when you get a chance and look back over the passage and i would like for you to underline where the scientists work and what they're using to help them find the water ","what i said was that scientists is used a small machine "
2753,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so it was in paragraph two the first sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
2757,510.1,Oliver,,"she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text ","um yeah so basically um okay so where i found my answer was the same place that student did in paragraph three that they said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2760,510.1,Chris,,,"well i guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things but i guess i'm confused like it sounds like the answer of jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like student and student like i don't understand like did the astronauts who saw the water did they use a microscope "
2762,510.1,Chris,,,"i'm um i don't know cuz i feel like they it doesn't say that there were astronauts but how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts "
2764,510.1,Chris,,,"okay "
2767,510.1,Luis,,,"i'm like i'm like i'm kind of thinking that like i understand i gotta look at the paragraph so i gotta see so if i look at it after i looked at it and listen to jazmin's answer like yeah i guess so lunar orbiter and i guess maybe they had astronauts or maybe they didn't but i guess yeah that's kind of what i think is that one "
2774,510.1,Oliver,,,"so i just i just wanted to say um because we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for coming into the classroom today and working with us like sometimes we get really are like we really frustrate our science teacher and i feel like you really took the time to listen to what we were saying and like really thought about like what our answers were and you also like really helped us to like work together because sometimes we get a little um we get a little irritable with each other so i think that it was really nice to like work together so like thank you a lot for like making that happen hi "
2776,510.1,Chris,,,"hello "
2778,510.1,Oliver,,,"well doing well we're excited to work with you today "
2784,510.1,Luis,,,"um well okay so first off i feel like i should even be in this class like i know a lot about space and i know all this stuff like i don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff i already know that "
2787,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks like when they're looking at the water on the moon "
2789,510.1,Luis,,,"gotcha okay that makes a lot of sense "
2791,510.1,Farrah,,,"so i said microscope but i'm not quite sure like why is my answer wrong "
2793,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah like cuz we're all here to like work with you and like away from the class so i figured like maybe like i did something like i said like it's like i feel like my answers wrong but like i don't know why "
2795,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh okay great "
2798,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so um i said that because on in paragraph three it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2802,510.1,Jazmin,,,"i guess my question is like so if farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like i'm confused like if my answers wrong Okay. "
2804,510.1,Chris,,,"um so like i was saying like i went to nasa and i know like a lot about like what the scientists use and like the equipment they have to use and like i know they have to use like oxygen tanks and like masks and suits and stuff like that "
2808,510.1,Chris,,,"so did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine student i don't know "
2811,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay gotcha okay that makes sense so i guess like i think that student and i are so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct "
2813,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay that makes sense "
2817,510.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and just thank you i'm like you were very patient with us and like sometimes our science teacher gets a little frustrated with our class but like you're so patient and you really like listened to our answers and like tried to help us to like put our answers together and think about class else's and we don't always do that so i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool "
2821,510.1,All,,,"hi "
2823,510.1,Luis,,,"i'm good but mr teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
2825,510.1,Luis,,,"i know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space and then they also wear gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and i know that they have boosters that get them up into space and then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to earth "
2827,510.1,Chris,,,"yes yes my dad me and my dad went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to "
2829,510.1,Chris,,,"because they can't breathe the atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here "
2832,510.1,Jazmin,,,"well i don't know a lot about space but i know that our environment is really bad and so we might have to live on mars or something if they keep destroying our earth "
2834,510.1,Oliver,,,"i'm not really into space so "
2836,510.1,Farrah,,,"well i read i read this book a wrinkle in time which is about going to different universes so they didn't go into space but they traveled through space and time "
2839,510.1,Farrah,,,"laughs that is pretty cool fiction but if you look back in the older books from the past a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen and with science we have brought it about we are able to do a lot of things like back in the 1930s is that a long time ago "
2844,510.1,Farrah,,,"really "
2847,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh wow yes yes we've got lots of phones yes i don't have one but i know student does "
2849,510.1,Chris,,,"oh man no no when me and my dad went to nasa we saw about that the whole controversy about when pluto was a planet and then it wasn't a planet and then it was a planet but i didn't know anything about saturn "
2853,510.1,Jazmin,,,"huh oh wow that's pretty cool "
2855,510.1,Luis,,,"no i didn't know anything about the saturn stuff and the moons and like teeny-weeny aliens that's like wow i mean that is pretty cool stuff i didn't know that "
2857,510.1,Luis,,,"ok cool "
2859,510.1,Oliver,,,"i mean i think aliens are kind of cool so yes i'd be down to learn about that "
2861,510.1,Jazmin,,,"mr lawrence but i didn't understand why my answer is wrong "
2864,510.1,Farrah,,,"no i meant on the story my teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small class because we needed more help with our answers but i told her that i think that i have the right answer oh well i thought i had the right answer too student but we're in this class i guess because our answers are wrong "
2868,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh ok so then my one about let me see what did i i know i circled a part of the story oh yes ok so i said "
2873,510.1,Oliver,,,"the microscope yes yes but i the teacher had us all come over here and she said class else's answers were right yes yes well i had the same one as you student so i thought that the microscope was the right answer i don't know "
2877,510.1,Jazmin,,,"Yes, but that's what I said. I said NASA sent a small machine. And that's the one, right there. So what's wrong with my answer? "
2879,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh ok well so i just had to add the name to my answer and then i'm good to go "
2881,420.2,Chris,,"that would help and go into a little bit more detail about it ","ok but mr lawrence i had something completely different cause i took my answer from paragraph one so i mean i don't know what's wrong i don't know why i'm in this class either you know "
2884,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok mr lawrence i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later "
2886,420.2,All,,,"bye "
2890,420.2,Luis,,,"ok so i said that water could be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because remember my dad's an astronaut laughs "
2892,420.2,Luis,,,"well i don't know i just saw it in the story and that looked like that was the important thing and i know i learned about it in science class "
2894,420.2,Luis,,,"ok "
2896,420.2,Luis,,,"so i just have to write down what you said "
2898,420.2,Luis,,,"ok i have to think about it then "
2900,420.2,Jazmin,,,"uh-huh "
2902,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes yes "
2904,420.2,Jazmin,,,"because "
2906,420.2,Jazmin,,,"we take a bath here and we drink water a lot and i was remembering what student and student were talking about and yes you need water to live and so yes that's what i was thinking yes "
2909,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes yes i think that's why i said that because i got that from the story and you know what else mr lawrence "
2911,420.2,Jazmin,,,"they could use the water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon too "
2914,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon "
2919,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um um Oh yes, yes. Yes, yes. "
2921,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yes yes right i forgot about that "
2923,420.2,Oliver,,,"i mean i guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon you know i guess i mean i'd probably want to have video games or something up there i think "
2926,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i had said i answered no "
2928,420.2,Farrah,,,"cause they said in the story that it was like they need to study the moon's surface and making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it's like it would take a long time for that to happen so that's why i said no not for a long time "
2931,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh so is my answer wrong "
2935,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok "
2937,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok ok "
2939,420.2,Chris,,,"mr lawrence "
2941,420.2,Chris,,,"i was thinking about what student said and you know how water could be broken down into two parts you know like hydrogen and oxygen i was like yes so then they could breathe right and then student could have a moon garden but i don't see how they could have fuel out of that "
2943,420.2,Chris,,,"uh-huh "
2945,420.2,Chris,,,"ok ok "
2947,310.1,Chris,,"that's a good question ","and is my answer did i get it right when i said that the water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore "
2950,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Excuse me, Mr. Lawrence? "
2952,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch "
2954,310.1,Jazmin,,,"but i wanted to say i appreciate that you helped me understand the meanings of some of water with the hydrogen and oxygen and what will be necessary and i guess also helped me and student kind of if we put our answers together then we'd have one right answer is that right "
2956,310.1,Luis,,,"ok oh cool so yes you've got to put me in there too student "
2958,310.1,All,,,"ok bye mr lawrence "
2960,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
2963,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh well we're excited to work with you "
2967,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so like here's my thing like no offense but i don't think i should be in this class like i know everything about space already so like i don't know why i should have to be here "
2970,310.1,Luis,,,"okay okay okay i'll give it a try "
2973,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i think it was a small machine "
2977,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't know where would i let's see i guess it's like the lunar orbiter is that the machine "
2981,310.1,Farrah,,,"um okay so here's what's interesting like okay so i think like the microscope is something that the astronauts used to look at the water but i don't understand cuz like you you wanted us to come and work over here so i'm kind of thinking like on maybe like okay so like why is my answer not quite right "
2983,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah "
2986,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh okay okay "
2989,310.1,Chris,,,"i think like the thing that i think so like okay so i kind of went to nasa like my dad took me to nasa so like i kind of feel like i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like they use oxygen tanks and masks and suits but i guess like i wonder if like the astronauts were on the lunar orbiter or if it was an unmanned aircraft "
2991,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
2994,310.1,Chris,,,"not sure "
2999,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so two things like i think like the lunar orbiter like probably like okay so if you do the reading and you look at the reading if you look like it doesn't say that like there are astronauts it just says that there's a machine it doesn't say that there are any astronauts it just says machines "
3001,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so i think what i'm wondering is like okay so if the lunar orbiter was this machine and it went up there did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like was it the thing that like kind of found the water um i wonder like i feel like i feel like are both student and my answer correct "
3007,410.2,Jazmin,,"but i think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific and getting a little bit more detail from the reading about the microscope and lunar orbiter so you're on the correct track student we just need to push it a little bit more into detail ","yes we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before we left for lunch that it was being nice just having you today and it was really nice to like talk to you and i think like one thing like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you really have to listen to each other and you really asked us to like rethink our answers and you were really patient with us and sometimes our teachers aren't as patient and so i just wanted to thank you for like really just like spending the time to like listen to our answers because that was really cool "
3011,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah well excuse me i shouldn't be ms class i already know all about space "
3019,410.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so i said um let me look back at my paper i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yes you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small now the question let's look at the question again the question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon now what are some keywords that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text equipment "
3023,410.2,Chris,,,"water and water I thought I thought water was an important one, too. "
3026,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i said equipment and i thought i circled discovered in the question for me "
3029,410.2,Luis,,,"well i think moons pretty important you know i mean that's where they are "
3031,410.2,Oliver,,,"i don't i guess no i guess not "
3038,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay oh oh wait nevermind i just realized you said paragraph two cuz i found my answer in paragraph three "
3041,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
3043,410.2,Jazmin,,"student you said that nasa sent a small machine right they did send a small machine but what i'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine ","oh lunar orbiter "
3048,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i just have to add the name of it and then my answers fine "
3050,410.2,Jazmin,,,"okay okay "
3052,420.2,Chris,,"so you got to pull those things together ","i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
3056,410.1,Chris,,"but yes student you are correct that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use but for this particular question it was the equipment that they used to discover water ","so but ok but they don't actually say anything about water and and paragraph true they only talk about water in paragraph i mean i say they say like you can drink water um but it doesn't say that like i didn't i didn't see discover or water in that paragraph "
3058,410.1,Oliver,,,"oh oh yeah ice "
3061,410.1,Chris,,,"oh oh okay okay okay um so it talks about ice and it talks about the lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about discover and and i know we're supposed to look for the word discover and i don't see it in there "
3065,410.1,Oliver,,,"sorry to interrupt mr teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later okay "
3070,410.1,Luis,,,"i think i got this figured out so i'm all good "
3073,420.1,Luis,,"Does anybody have a key word that they want to look at? ","okay i think that it was evidence "
3075,420.1,Chris,,,"i said water again this time because i think that's what the whole thing is about "
3080,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah so um info which paragraph was it okay yeah in the first one because it's the whole the title is water is a valuable resource right so i said the thing about water is heavy so it's it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
3084,310.1,Luis,,"so way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now ","wait yeah so a my answers is good but i don't understand why i gotta be in this class because i did that i did everything right right "
3087,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay yes still can yeah i'm still confused "
3089,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well because if if he got the right answer then i thought that i had the right answer "
3097,310.1,Jazmin,,"so yes that's another great example of convincing evidence ","wait i have to i have to write down all the other stuff that you just said "
3101,420.2,Jazmin,,"we just need to add on to it that because you can drink water and waters on the moon that's convincing evidence that it is valuable so we just have to rework your answer ","okay i have to add something about convincing evidence you can't survive without water that is convincing evidence okay is that good "
3107,420.2,Luis,,,"oh there it is there it is okay your paragraph five in my second sentence yeah "
3109,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
3111,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay so then that's so okay so then that's my answer so that they can breathe "
3113,420.2,Luis,,,"look back at paragraph i don't know "
3115,420.2,Luis,,,"oh rocket fuel rocket fuel "
3119,420.2,Luis,,,"teacher i gotta write down i gotta write down all of that stuff that you just said that's a long answer man "
3122,420.2,Luis,,"Is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it. ","How come. How come I have to add all of that and Chris Chris and Jazmin didn't have to add all that to their answers. "
3126,310.1,Farrah,,"you found another good piece of evidence ","oh i mean i can see i can see where they're coming from but i still think that i was right i said not for a long time you know "
3128,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm here yeah they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so so the answer's no "
3130,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah yeah cuz we read that in the first part it says they're small amounts yeah "
3133,310.1,Farrah,,,"nope "
3138,420.2,Oliver,,"And so you, you do have a good convincing Answer right there. I lost my train of thought,  just so that we can explain a little bit more on why you think it's not going to be able to be useful, just because they're smaller amounts of it. Okay. ","teacher it that looks like our time for the next class took out but i know i heard you're telling class that they have to add more details to their answer so i'm sure that's what you were going to tell me too is that we have to have more more evidence from the text and our answers "
3140,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay well we'll see you next time "
3143,420.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing great we're really happy to see you "
3145,420.2,Luis,,,"i don't think i need to be in this class you know cuz i already know like all about space you know so i don't need any help "
3148,420.2,Luis,,,"that's that sounds great "
3153,420.2,Jazmin,,,"basically it was this small machine i think that's how they found the water "
3156,310.1,Jazmin,,"what i'm concerned about is we're not getting the whole picture there okay so can we look where it says small machine and figure out what that small machine was called good i see where you're going with that ","that makes sense okay i didn't really answer the question so lunar orbiter "
3158,310.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i wondering like i think i'm still confused like why my answer is wrong "
3160,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yes so basically my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3162,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm like you know you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that "
3164,310.1,Farrah,,,"um let's see it was i think it was in paragraph three "
3167,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh sorry "
3172,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah right there "
3175,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i'm guessing not do you have any ideas for how i can find like or like you know what i mean like how i could tell the difference because it seems like they would have to look through the microscope to see the water how could they find it if they couldn't see it "
3180,310.1,Farrah,,,"that's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate Yeah a lunar orbiter. "
3186,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so like um well i went to nasa and and i saw like exhibit so i was thinking that you know they would have to use oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that "
3190,410.2,Chris,,"mr student did you consider that those machines were not mentioned in our text ","oh okay oh yeah okay okay "
3192,430.2,Chris,,"So even though we might have prior knowledge, which is what you have, because she went to NASA. That's amazing. And that's awesome to bring to the table, but I want you to try to find the answer in the text. Okay. ","gotcha okay that makes sense "
3194,430.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i think that we are getting more comfortable unfortunately we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us "
3198,430.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah so basically like i circled the same thing like in the paragraph three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3201,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess this is kind of a question um so here's the thing like i know all about space like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't really get answers about space like wrong and like i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i have to do any work on it "
3206,410.2,Luis,,"however when we're given a text we do have to look at what it talks about in the text i know that you answered saying that they used equipment like oxygen tanks but that was not mentioned in the text ","so i gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like i gotta read the text "
3209,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah definitely "
3212,410.2,Chris,,,"um yeah i think it could be um i just feel like also like for me like i went to nasa and i know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space "
3215,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah i can i can take a look "
3217,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so here's what i was wondering um so i said that the the microscope was how they studied the water but i don't understand like why my answer is why my answers kind of wrong "
3219,410.2,Farrah,,,"like i'm thinking about like who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking so like i think the microscope like they definitely used it and i think that's how they discovered it but maybe my answers wrong "
3230,420.1,Jazmin,,"And then they told you that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it closely. That is one way that you could find it. But is that the way that NASA found it on the moon? ","i think what's interesting is that it was kind of like my answer but there was like there was more to my answer so i said they sent a small machin but the small machine is the lunar orbiter so that's how i think they discovered the water "
3232,420.1,Jazmin,,,"well we can't quiet do the thumbs but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree is that okay "
3240,420.1,Jazmin,,,"we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to take a minute to thank you for working with us like like sometimes our science teacher gets kind of frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us understand like the difference between like discovering something and the difference between like studying it and also like i feel like student and student like they it seems like they understand better like that you have to really use the text you can't just use like information from your life you have to study the text so i just wanted to thank you cuz it was really clear and it was really interesting to hear other people's answers so thank you so much "
3246,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i think like i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
3248,420.1,Luis,,,"um so basically what i was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine "
3253,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i actually did get a different answer because i was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope i feel like you know like that was really the equipment that they use to find the water okay so you know initially that's what i thought too but then i revise my answer to scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon "
3256,420.1,Farrah,,,"that's a really interesting question like i got to the answer partially by listening carefully to student and her answer and to our discussions together but really think that i got to the answer by reading the text more close because i think that i missunderstood the question because they didn't use the microscope to find the water they used the microscope like afterwards to study the water but it was the lunar orbiter that really found the water "
3259,420.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so like student you're saying that like basically like that you know if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it you have to find it first is that right yeah "
3261,420.1,Chris,,,"oh um i actually didn't mean to raise my hand up sorry "
3263,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and i just wanted to say that i changed my answer "
3265,420.1,Jazmin,,,"basicallt my answer was incomplete and i was just saying small machine instead of like that it was the lunar orbiter you know what i mean "
3268,530.1,Jazmin,,"and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change ","yeah that's a really good question i sort of thought about it first i looked more closely at the text that was thinking why was my answer wrong at first and i was trying to figure it out and basically you know if if the lunar orbiter was the small machine so i kind of had the answer but i just i just wasn't complete in what i was saying "
3271,520.1,Chris,,"i think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it ","i guess like i went to nasa and so i i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and i guess i'm wondering like why that wasn't right "
3273,420.3,Chris,,"student why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe reread it and highlight some keywords or helpful passages then see if you can come to that answer yourself ","okay i'll take a look "
3275,420.3,Oliver,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but um i think we'll see you again soon "
3277,420.3,Chris,,,"hi how are you "
3279,420.3,Luis,,,"doing well "
3281,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's what i was thinking um i know all about space so like i don't think i have to be in this class because i feel like i know everything there is to know already "
3283,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah "
3286,420.3,Luis,,,"um so i think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around "
3290,420.3,Luis,,,"i didn't really read it so i can read it i guess "
3292,420.3,Luis,,,"okay i'll do that "
3295,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so here's my main question i'm trying to understand like why my answer is wrong "
3299,410.2,Farrah,,"your answer is about how the kind of water that they found was microscopic but it doesn't really say how they got the water ","yes so like so okay so the question was like how did scientists discover water on the moon and like so they use a microscope for like something for like to like study the water "
3301,410.1,Farrah,,"yes so the water they found you would use a microscope to study it but it doesn't explain how they found the water ","oh ok ok gotcha "
3304,410.1,Jazmin,,,"student do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon basically the scientists used a small machine "
3306,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i can look it up "
3308,410.1,Jazmin,,,"it's paragraph two it says nasa small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter "
3313,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i think like i kind of disagree like i went to nasa with my dad and we like looked at like the stuff that they use to like fly around and i feel like the scientists like would have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like when they're out in like the space like they'd have to you know use all that stuff so i'm still confused like why luis's answer was incorrect "
3319,410.2,Chris,,"what student and student described is how they got to the moon and not what they used to discover water on the moon ","yeah i think that's a little clearer "
3322,410.2,Oliver,,,"um i guess like what i was wondering like um okay so like a small machine well okay so i think that i'm beginning to understand but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and i got the same answer as student so it sounds like the answer is the lunar orbiter but i just wanted to understand like why the lunar orbiter is the right answer and the microscope's not quite the right answer "
3324,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah "
3328,410.2,Oliver,,,"so they use the lunar orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it "
3332,410.2,Jazmin,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you "
3334,410.2,Jazmin,,,"sure "
3339,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i just wanted to take a moment and thank you like sometimes our science teacher gets frustrated with us but you were so patient in listening to like what we had to say and then also like you like took our answers and you like kind of helped us to understand each other's answers and like understand better like kind of about the text but like by helping us listened to each other and sometimes we get kind of like in fights with each other but this was really easy for us to listen so just to like thank you for your patience and like helping us to listen to each other "
3341,410.2,Oliver,,,"hi "
3343,410.2,Chris,,,"we're doing good thank you "
3345,410.2,Luis,,,"um yes so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because like i already know like all this stuff about space and i don't really need to be here for help "
3347,410.2,Luis,,,"okay "
3349,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
3351,410.2,Luis,,,"um so the reason that i mentioned it was because i know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use like stuff like that in order to walk around "
3357,410.2,Luis,,,"well i guess i didn't really look at the text because i already knew this Maybe there's something in there because I didn't, I didn't really read because I thought I already knew. Okay. "
3360,410.2,Farrah,,,"yeah "
3362,410.2,Farrah,,,"well like you use it to like study something and like look at something really closely you know what i mean like you you look at it like like small things "
3364,410.2,Farrah,,,"um so i think if i remember it's like you um okay so in the text is said that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so like i guess it helps you look at small things "
3366,310.1,Farrah,,"you're you're correct and i'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct thank you student ","awesome but i have one question um like why is my it's because we're all here to like work on it together like what why is my answer not quite right "
3368,310.1,Farrah,,,"so i guess they're looking at like something really small they're looking at the water they're studying the water "
3371,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i was gonna say basically the same thing like you can look closely at the water "
3373,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well like i don't know like what if like it's not really in the reading but like you could look at germs and stuff "
3375,310.1,Oliver,,,"ah they could look at like the sand and like the dirt "
3378,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes so i'm just so i guess my question is like so whose answer is like i thought that it was a small machine and i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not right "
3381,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well i guess i guess in the reading i guess i can look and see ok ok ok i see it so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is it the lunar orbiter "
3385,310.1,Chris,,"it is the lunar orbiter great job looking back at the text thank you for that ","um you know so like here's the thing like um like okay so i guess i don't understand still like because you have to like luis's answer like i went to nasa so like i know that you have to use a space soon if you're gonna go like walk around and study something so i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not quite right "
3388,310.1,Chris,,,"oh they found it in the craters that were full of water "
3393,310.1,Chris,,,"i thought that um i thought that's what they said Um, yeah, okay, um, scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. however they used to believe there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
3395,310.1,Chris,,,"oh so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope "
3398,310.1,Chris,,,"so how did they find the water "
3403,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so we have to go to lunch but before we went i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for working with us today like sometimes like we really upset like the science teacher because he gets a little frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us to feel like we were part of like like a class like like that we weren't just wrong like that we had like some learning to do that we could do together and so like it was really nice that you are just so supportive of each of us as we try to learn about it so thank you so much "
3406,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i was just gonna say like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
3410,430.3,Chris,,"well i'm glad you know all about space but we're looking for specific information from the text that we have i like that you focused on the the craters in the moon but i'm a little concerned that you think they're full of water can you go back and look in section two or paragraph two of the text and try to find a quantity of ice or water inside that paragraph ","yeah oh i'm 32 ounces and 4 glasses "
3412,430.3,Chris,,,"no that's that's um that's not very much at all "
3414,430.3,Chris,,,"i guess not so the craters aren't full at all "
3417,430.3,Farrah,,,"yeah that was people used to find it "
3420,430.3,Farrah,,"well that's where i'm concerned a microscope is used to look at objects not really to find them do you think you can look in paragraph two and find the name of the machine that's used to find the water ","yeah let me see i see well is it the is it the lunar orbiter "
3423,430.3,Farrah,,,"no he just found a little water is that was what student found but i think i'm still a little confused just like why my answers not correct so like it seems like they found you know what i mean like yeah they use the orbiter but didn't they use the microscope because they could see it without the without the microscope right "
3426,430.3,Farrah,,,"that's interesting so they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it they were using my something else on the lunar orbiter like a sensor or something like that "
3428,430.3,Farrah,,,"okay yeah okay yeah that makes sense so did they use the microscope i'm like it sounds like they used it so i guess did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope "
3433,430.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i followed along so i think like okay so the lunar orbiter was the thing that discovered the water um and then like they use the microscope to study it after they found it "
3436,310.1,Chris,,"yes they could use the microscope after they found it to study it that's very good deduction there i like what you did there student ","um well i was just thinking so my dad took me to nasa and like when we were there like i know that but we saw that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like i was thinking like did they not use those things as oh "
3438,310.1,Chris,,,"okay yeah okay so they weren't actually there so they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that student like that's the thing to remember like they didn't do that is that right "
3442,410.3,Luis,,"and with that student let's look at student student you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but like we just talked about with student that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story so i'm concerned why you're talking about things not in our story ","yeah i was using up like you know how we talked about in class sometimes like background knowledge so i was using background knowledge and i was thinking like um you know like that was like probably enough to answer that question but i was thinking like i guess i was wondering like even though it wasn't in the story like why should i not use background knowledge this time "
3446,410.3,Luis,,,"gotcha oh ok so they did like okay that makes sense so it's really like what was in there reading so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with "
3448,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i think i got everything figured out so i think i'm all that "
3454,420.2,Luis,,"all right well then if you think you're good let's look at your response first let's see our water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that is very true but i'm concerned that you're not giving me a reason to as why it could be valuable on the moon is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen and oxygen can be used for ","me see yeah so you can use them for rocket fuel I'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen And you can drink the water. "
3457,420.2,Jazmin,,,"you're talking about i remember that it wasn't actually a lot so i'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded like it sounded like there was it very much why is there enough water for astronauts "
3461,420.2,Jazmin,,,"take it with them On a spaceship. "
3464,420.2,Jazmin,,,"we get i think it would be like yes it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already and then they could just build their even and they could see it right there "
3469,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i'm i think what they were saying is that they were saying that like you could you know you could basically not have to take the water or you could just get it from the moon "
3472,410.3,Chris,,"well like we just talked about with student there's not a lot of water on the moon so i'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore do you think they may still need to take some water with them ","yeah i guess so if there's like if there's not very much because we said that like there were only a few ounces right glasses on and so like it actually wouldn't be enough to you know what i mean do everything but i think it would be really valuable because water is so heavy but that doesn't make sense yet so they they still yeah they would still have to carry some on the ship "
3474,410.3,Chris,,,"they could drink the water "
3479,410.3,Oliver,,,"um so i think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like all all yeah i can use us really easily like i read somewhere that they weren't going to maybe put a moon base up on the moon in 2024 and i was thinking like they they wouldn't like they don't really have figured out it seems like like they need to come up with a plan to get the water out of the moon like they said in the read "
3484,310.1,Oliver,,"exactly that's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build ","lots of time and money so that seems like like it seems like you know we don't spend like very much money on like space travel like that's something that i know from my reading so it seems like it would be kind of i'm like it seems like it would be kind of hard to like make this work because it seems like a really expensive "
3491,310.1,Oliver,,,"um so unfortunately unfortunately we we have to go to our next class but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like explain to us what we all needed to work on like offering like the concerns that you had and you are so kind about the way offer them that i think we offer really okay with like hearing about concerns like i don't think class took it personally you know what i mean and i think like class like really learned something from being able to listen to each other so you really also give a suggestion on like how we should do so it was really fun working with thank you so much hi "
3493,310.1,Chris,,,"we're doing okay "
3496,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so here's what i was just needed to say is i don't think i should be in this class like i don't like i know all about space already so like i don't think i need to be here "
3499,310.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah "
3505,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay yeah yeah so um i said that the the scientists that they okay if i look at the text it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i think it was a microscope but i'm not sure like why my answers not right "
3508,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i pretty much said the same thing as student and i circled the same area like in paragraph three that the um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i think you have to use a microscope to discover the water "
3511,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah so like for me like i kind of just like i went to nasa so like i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i know that they have to use all that stuff and like the craters are so full of water on the moon that like i guess it's pretty easy to find "
3513,310.1,Jazmin,,,"that okay so i think that it's this small machine "
3515,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa send this machine called lunar orbiter to investigate so lunar orbiter "
3522,310.1,Luis,,,"i guess i didn't really read it like i kind of knew the answer so i just kind of didn't read the text Yeah. "
3525,310.1,Luis,,,"um sure i'll take a look at it okay "
3529,310.1,Farrah,,,"um so i think like so i can kind of wondering like who is right like is student right or are student and i right because like like is it the microscope that discovered the water or is it the lunar orbiter "
3533,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so my answer "
3535,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right "
3539,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay okay that makes sense "
3543,310.1,Oliver,,,"um so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment before we had to go to thank you like you were really patient with us and you like helped us like use our prior knowledge to like like be part of the discussion and so i just wanted to thank you for like taking the time to do that because it was really nice and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient with us "
3546,310.1,Jazmin,,,"good great "
3548,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class teacher i know a lot about space "
3550,310.1,Luis,,,"maybe i can teach you class some stuff yeah "
3555,310.1,Farrah,,,"um well i saw the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water and so i found it in paragraph three "
3560,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes when when it's time for us to take out microscopes she's like okay take out the equipment for science class and we're going to use the microscopes so then i was looking at a question and i was looking for something on the story that talked about like you know discovering water and i saw the part where it says you need a microscope which is a tool which is equipment to look really closely and then we're talking about the water "
3565,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't see anything that said discover in the story i'll look again teacher yes it's me student i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
3568,410.2,Jazmin,,"they did send a small machine to discover water on the moon but what was the name we're looking for more detail what was the name of the small machine ","oh i don't remember "
3571,430.2,Jazmin,,"we need to be a little more detailed we can't just say a microscope we can't just say a small machine you know a microscope is a small machine so we need to be a little more detailed and go back into the passage and highlight what they used to discover water on the moon ","okay so i have to say more details "
3576,420.3,Oliver,,"and as you're reading the passage you know might be good to take a highlighter and highlight keywords so when you go back you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers ","okay okay okay i'll try that because i still don't see on discover and here so i'll see what i find "
3578,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i just found the name um and so i added i added the rest of that sentence to my answer so now my answer says nasa sent a small machine cutter lunar orbiter to investigate "
3581,420.3,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
3584,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i talked about equipment in my answer "
3589,420.3,Luis,,,"it does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks "
3592,420.3,Luis,,,"okay all right now i should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like i guess i could what student said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter "
3595,420.2,Oliver,,"exactly exactly the more detail you have the better off your answer is ","i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go time for the next class so we'll see you later "
3598,420.2,Luis,,,"hi teacher can you see yes "
3602,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good yeah i'm doing pretty good you know what a long day "
3604,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i'm a teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
3606,420.2,Luis,,,"okay "
3617,420.2,Oliver,,,"working for our equipment and for water "
3621,420.2,Oliver,,,"Was covered water. "
3623,410.1,Farrah,,"Farrah. I'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. ","yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
3625,410.1,Farrah,,"student i'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely well you do need a microscope to look really closely but this question is we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","but they said that you need the microscope to look at the water "
3633,410.1,Jazmin,,"but right now we're looking for the actual piece of equipment that was used to discover water on the moon ","student that's where i got my answer from "
3635,410.1,Jazmin,,,"that's where i got my answer from that sentence at the beginning of the second paragraph "
3637,410.2,Jazmin,,"right nasa sent a small machine but you need more detail yes they did send a small machine but what was the name of this small machine ","um i think you just said the lunar orbiter "
3640,310.1,Farrah,,"i see where student could have got her answer it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely ","yeah yeah that's where i got mine from "
3642,420.1,Farrah,,"right but if you go back and you reread the question again and you take out your highlighters and you go slowly you're looking for the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it "
3648,420.1,Chris,,,"okay i guess it's not a question but i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
3652,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so i'm reading it now and the other thing i guess is that i don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter so how can that be the right one because they don't have discover in this one oh i do see look for ice "
3656,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so me and student thought discover and looking at where it's the same thing and now okay yeah and i forgot to discover means to look for something and so i missed i missed that one in paragraph two "
3658,510.1,Chris,,"make sure when you're reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to your question ","yeah i couldn't see how i missed that one um yeah okay "
3664,510.1,Oliver,,,"okay wow well teacher it's been a short time but thank you so much for working with us and i really appreciate how you asked us some questions so that we can think about how we got to our answers and then really explained our strategy where we really want to look closely at all of the words and the question and make sure we understand it because man to man i didn't realize that we we didn't understand exactly what discover man "
3666,510.1,Oliver,,,"you know "
3669,510.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
3671,510.1,Oliver,,,"we're excited to work with you "
3675,510.1,Luis,,,"i i i really know like i don't think i need any help with this because i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i should be in this class "
3677,510.1,Luis,,,"wow like okay so they use like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like you know all the stuff that astronauts have to use right "
3681,510.1,Luis,,,"okay "
3684,510.1,Jazmin,,,"and i thought it was a small machine "
3686,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i thought it was a small machine "
3690,510.1,Oliver,,,"let me see i can't quite remember Um, so I circled the same thing as Farrah. And what I said was that it was basically people use the microscope. "
3694,510.1,Speaker,,,"well yeah so i was trying to figure out like was i guess i don't understand why my my answer was wrong because like was the microscope did they use the microscope because it seems like they did use the microscope "
3696,510.1,Chris,,,"yes so i was kind of thinking like um i was thinking that well i went to nasa and i know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters "
3699,510.1,Jazmin,,,"and when i look back in i saw like what it what it said it said let me read it it said nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so was it the lunar orbiter "
3703,510.1,Bennett,,"so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called ","i'm unfortunately we have to go to lunch so thank you so much for working with us but we have to go on to lunch let's see yes so we'll continue on and just continue the lesson where you left off using the moves that we talked about today and just see how it goes all right here we go "
3705,510.1,All,,,"or you're not able to see us "
3708,510.1,All,,,"you might have back into your zoom "
3711,510.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i i always have something interesting to share for sure i just wanted to say like my dad is an astronaut so again like i know all about this spot "
3716,510.1,Oliver,,,"um so i saw i listened to jazmin's answer she said that it was um the lunar orbiter i think "
3721,310.1,Jazmin,,"and when you couldn't quite remember what the name of it was i like how you went back to your text and re-read the information sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread your text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you so great job class i like how class is reading their text and finding the details in the reading ","so my answer was sort of right and sort of wrong like when i said like nasa used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right because i didn't say orbiters right "
3725,310.1,Bennett,,"it was the right answer but i like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details so you weren't wrong but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was ","gotcha well we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and particularly i wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that i was because i was thinking about it but i guess i didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer that was really cool are yeah and i really appreciate that that you're so interested in my stories about like my dad and space and all that stuff so thank you so much welcome back so how did that feel "
3727,310.1,Oliver,,,"how are you today "
3730,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's the thing like um so i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all sorts of stuff about space already "
3732,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
3735,310.1,Luis,,,"um so maybe i didn't really um look at the text i kind of just knew that "
3738,310.1,Luis,,,"Okay. "
3743,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i can totally do that so i circled the same things as student and i said in paragraph three that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3746,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i'm not sure "
3751,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i can do that i guess what i saw so nasa it's in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate so i guess it's the lunar orbiter right "
3756,310.1,Chris,,"exactly very good and nice job looking back at the text ","and i see that student answered that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and they did find that on the moon but what equipment student did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters well so that's kind of interesting like so i went to nasa with my dad like so yeah it was really awesome and like when we went there like they talked about how like that astronauts had to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff so s that the answer "
3761,310.1,Chris,,,"well i guess based on like jazmin's i guess the lunar orbiter "
3764,310.1,Chris,,,"i have a question okay "
3766,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i don't understand um can you help me understand why my answer's not correct "
3768,310.1,Farrah,,,"um it's student "
3772,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah that makes a lot of sense "
3775,310.1,Luis,,,"i do i do i do student is yeah i have a question "
3780,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so actually um we have to go to lunch here in just a second but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you were so patient with us and also like i realized like i kind of just brought understanding like to the table but you like helped me to understand like like that i have to look at the text and that's really important so i really appreciate that because i don't always think that way so thank you for being so patient with us "
3786,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah sure um mr teacher i shouldn't be on this class i don't already know all about space "
3788,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
3790,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so um i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3792,310.1,Luis,,,"nevermind i'll wait "
3795,310.1,Farrah,,,"um what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon "
3798,310.1,Farrah,,,"the microscope "
3803,310.1,Farrah,,,"nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate looks for ice deposits large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small "
3806,310.1,Farrah,,,"on the lunar orbiter "
3808,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh they say simple lunar orbiter to investigate "
3811,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ah i'm sorry mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong too "
3814,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah you just told student that was the right answer the lunar orbiter "
3820,420.2,Jazmin,,"lunar orbiter right so if you add it in that nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter you think that could have clarified your answer ","yeah that makes sense i understand "
3829,420.2,Luis,,,"said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks I mean, they use oxygen tanks when they were on the moon. Um, I mean, that's what the story is about them going to the moon. Okay, well, okay, okay. In the first paragraph. It says, scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep in the moon's polar craters, and if they find that. "
3831,420.2,Luis,,,"then then that means that they had to go there in order to find it "
3834,420.2,Luis,,,"nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay "
3836,420.2,Luis,,,"no "
3838,420.2,Luis,,,"well cuz i i know a lot about space you know i i watched some tv shows and sometimes i'll watch nova on youtube "
3841,410.1,Luis,,"the question is not based on the videos that you watched or the youtube videos you watch it's about what you read ","it doesn't "
3844,410.1,Jazmin,,,"um okay um so the scientists sent what the name of the thing lunar orbiter "
3846,410.1,Luis,,,"ok ok so scientists sent the lunar orbiter to the moon "
3848,410.1,Luis,,,"to discover water "
3855,410.1,Chris,,,"mr teacher i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and i guess the lunar orbiter too Well, like even just said they use the Lunar Orbiter. "
3859,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah yeah well i was just looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch but thanks for taking the time to work with us okay "
3864,410.1,Luis,,,"i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut "
3868,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
3872,410.1,Jazmin,,,"is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
3874,410.1,Jazmin,,,"well um it says that there's water on the moon and what is valuable because you need it to drink "
3878,410.1,Jazmin,,,"if there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon they'd have to bring their own water "
3881,410.1,Jazmin,,,"water on the moon can be valuable i mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water yes see that's where i got my "
3883,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i'm water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
3885,410.1,Jazmin,,,"because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
3887,410.1,Jazmin,,,"it says that water is heavy you know i also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon "
3889,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i like that movie "
3893,410.1,Jazmin,,,"um okay so i can say i should ask and drink the water you can't survive without water having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft water is heavy "
3895,410.1,Chris,,,"so if if you don't have to carry the water then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry "
3897,410.1,Chris,,,"well i know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane you know they weigh our suitcases and so um but i know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space so "
3900,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah "
3905,410.1,Chris,,,"sorry teacher i just i just thought of one more thing yes that i had read also that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
3909,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sure okay so um i said no it's not ready yet because last paragraph they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon yeah "
3912,410.1,Oliver,,,"Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money. "
3916,410.1,Oliver,,,"i don't think so Oh yeah, we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there. "
3920,410.1,Oliver,,,"right like like i remember okay "
3927,410.1,Oliver,,,"Okay. okay why would it be valuable okay okay in paragraph five it says moon water it could be useful and other ways or it can be broken down into two parts that's what i said hydrogen and oxygen and oh okay astronauts could breathe oxygen but that's not water that's oxygen "
3930,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so they could breathe the oxygen part of the water "
3933,410.1,Luis,,,"it sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel "
3935,410.1,Luis,,,"well i mean like if i needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel i guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home "
3938,410.1,Jazmin,,,"cuz cuz you were telling student that if it's too heavy well it's better to be light so if they have less gas when they take off then they have their lighter and they can go faster "
3942,410.1,Oliver,,,"you can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen we can breathe oxygen "
3944,410.1,Luis,,,"and and we can make they can make rocket fuel with it "
3948,410.1,Farrah,,,"i don't remember the other thing it was the thing that you said student it's it's it if you if you can get water up there then you don't have to take it with you i guess "
3950,410.1,Farrah,,,"to drink or bath "
3952,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah "
3955,410.1,Oliver,,,"i'm trying my supporting but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go but i did want to say that i appreciate it how you kept asking about why we were making the senators like you asked me why did i say nothing and i then it helped me kind of think about what i found in the story for my answer "
3957,410.1,Oliver,,,"i appreciate you "
3960,410.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you "
3963,410.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah so we all looked at that question and so we shared our answers but here's the thing like i don't think i need to be in this class because like i already know all about space so i don't like i don't need to like be like learn more i already know about it "
3965,410.1,Luis,,,"wow okay so ah the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3967,410.1,Luis,,,"so i said like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need like all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space "
3971,410.1,Luis,,,"maybe i didn't really read it Okay. Okay, so paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. "
3974,410.1,Luis,,,"okay this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water "
3977,410.1,Luis,,,"um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3981,410.1,Jazmin,,,"um like jazmin's answer the small machine okay and student what was the small machine called ok so after we just read it the small machine is called a lunar orbiter "
3983,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah i didn't really read it the first time so yeah i think that i see i think i understand like why that's that might be a better answer "
3985,410.1,Farrah,,,"yes okay so like um i didn't understand like maybe you can help me understand like why my answer is wrong "
3987,410.1,Farrah,,,"okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to investigate "
3989,410.1,Farrah,,,"the question sayas what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3993,410.1,Farrah,,,"i guess like student and jazmin's answer was the lunar orbiter but like is like microscope is that equipment too did they discover it with the microscope "
3996,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh ok i see "
3998,410.1,Farrah,,,"so they discovered it "
4001,410.1,Oliver,,,"um i did read the article and i did circle the same thing though like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but i heard what student was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it "
4005,410.2,Oliver,,"the thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same as student which shows me that you're either looking at farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea ","okay "
4009,410.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so like like here's the thing like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and like stuff like that so like is that possibly an answer i went to nasa with my dad "
4018,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so basically okay so i just we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to like thank you real quick like for working with us today and like like i wanted to thank you for like helping us to listen to each other like sometimes we kind of don't like listen to each other very well and we kind of make like our science teacher gets kind of frustrated but you are really patient and like asking i still listen to each other's answers and i think i think there was a lot to learn from that and that was pretty cool so like just wanted to thank you for like doing that and like taking that time for us to do that "
4022,410.2,Oliver,,,"we're happy to see you "
4024,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and outer space and and craft that fly into space "
4034,420.1,Luis,,"now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some keywords that we have in our question now i want you to look at the question one more time and if there are words you don't understand circle them ","um yeah so i guess i was wondering like i think i know the words but i was wondering about like discover "
4036,420.1,Oliver,,,"so what i chose i think i know the words but i was wondering about equipment because i basically said the same thing as student what was that it was the microscope "
4038,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i had the same answer as student "
4040,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i actually feel like i knew what each of the words meant "
4042,420.1,Chris,,,"not like i really love space and my dad has taken me to nasa before so i think i know the words pretty well "
4045,420.1,Oliver,,"look at those words again and share your ideas of what you think those words mean ","so student i think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use "
4049,420.1,Jazmin,,,"so basically we said like what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say okay people would use and so i was wondering cuz i was like confused why my answer was wrong "
4056,420.1,Oliver,,,"and discover is like when you find something "
4058,420.1,Oliver,,,"like like yeah when you find it "
4062,420.1,Chris,,,"i also said microscope right yeah "
4066,420.1,Chris,,,"Um, well, I was just thinking that some other tools were like, because I went to NASA. And I saw that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that. So did they use those things? "
4074,420.3,Farrah,,"so what we want to do now is to go back to the passage take a closer look at the passage and see if you can identify where the words equipment and discover are as it relates to finding the water Or we could say, look at the word investigating this case. Alright, so go back in the passage and look for me. ","oh yeah i can do that okay so basically it's nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
4076,420.3,Farrah,,,"the lunar orbiter "
4079,420.3,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i think that will have a chance to see you after lunch so we have to run really quick "
4081,420.3,Jazmin,,,"hey can you see us "
4084,420.3,Jazmin,,,"you might have to close the zoom window or move it out of the way or maybe move your internet browser out of the way "
4089,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just wanted to say my dad is an astronaut so i think that could be kind of helpful "
4093,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so discover means like to find something or to you know investigate like the way that nasa use the small machine to get to the water "
4095,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it was the lunar orbiter "
4100,420.3,Jazmin,,,"You find something? Look for it? "
4103,420.3,Jazmin,,,"is it investigate "
4110,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm actually i'm sorry we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and what was really special when you are working with us is that you really help us to understand the meaning of the word discover because we didn't totally understand when we started but now we all know what discover meets and not just that but you helped us use evidence from the text you made sure that we were using information from the text and not just stuff that we knew from like our background so that was really awesome thank you so much for working with us "
4114,420.3,Oliver,,,"we're doing well how are you "
4116,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so i don't know if like i should really be in this class because i know like all about space and like i know all this stuff so like i don't know that i should really have to work on it "
4124,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i think we did yeah yeah i think we did "
4127,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think so "
4130,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so equipment is like something that you you like use to accomplish a task like it's something like a machine or like a tool that you use to do something "
4136,420.3,Farrah,,,"so like discover so like discover is that's where you you find something "
4140,420.3,Farrah,,,"um i think that i think that you were just about to say this but i am not quite sure why maybe it's serious wrong because i think it's the microscope "
4143,420.3,Farrah,,,"i'm like in the reading "
4145,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so um let's see in paragraph three they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4148,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh you mean "
4154,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh like like oh like your mean like the difference between like finding it and like like looking at it they said, what did they use to find it. "
4159,420.3,Jazmin,,,"I realized that based on what they're saying, the small machine, I think was the thing that I think this small machine is what found that water. In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4161,420.3,Jazmin,,,"look for "
4164,420.3,Chris,,,"um yeah i was just kind of wondering like so i went to nasa with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff so like i know that scientists like have to use lots of equipment but but i was thinking that they used equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that "
4167,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah yeah oh "
4170,420.3,Chris,,,"Yeah, the lunar orbiter "
4178,420.3,Jazmin,,,"So, we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say really quickly i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for like you were so patient with us like sometimes we can frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient and you help us to really listen to each other and like help build our answers like off one another and that was really cool cuz cuz that doesn't always happen and also you were really careful about like the answer to the question and like helping us break down the words to be honestly sometimes we don't read as carefully as we could so you really helped us to read carefully i just want to thank you "
4182,420.3,Luis,,,"oh hi um i just was gonna say that um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
4185,420.3,Luis,,,"i can do that "
4190,420.3,Chris,,,"um yeah so i did a look i think so i'm going to guess that i didn't you were saying i didn't answer the question right because the question was how did the scientists what equipment did the scientists use to discover water and i just was talking about the creative right right "
4193,420.3,Jazmin,,,"to be connected with that they use a small machine "
4197,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i guess ever since you were we were talking i was just wonder like i guess still not sure like my my answer "
4211,510.1,Farrah,,"let's take our little answer and make it a great big answer to make it make more sense to make it concrete Use your context. ","um okay so should i should do the part that i circled yes okay basically so okay what i was circling was i still stuck on the microscope and i can i can tell you why i said it like because it says it's a scientific to exit and then i circled like small machine because i think that was jazzmines answer and and it sounds like that might also be it but i guess i'm thinking that okay so it's both the small machine and and the microscope "
4214,510.1,Oliver,,,"one pretty much the same thing i i just start called the microscope again because i still think that that was what they used to you know to to discover it like when they were discovering the water like how could they discover it if you can't see yet and they said that the ice was microscope "
4218,510.1,Luis,,,"um so i basically when i went in i circle lunar orbiter and microscope "
4223,420.2,Jazmin,,"so how about let's restate the question to form our answer ","orbiter the lunar orbiter "
4229,420.2,Farrah,,"see how that answer grows yeah this is really short one word answer we created a whole sentence where class reading our answer can identify what we are talking about what we're learning about ","with you up me "
4231,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh this is student "
4240,420.2,Farrah,,,"no that's okay sometimes i can have a voice that sounds like the voice so um yeah basically i guess i think i understand so okay so in the in the question like we restate the question it's like scientists use the you know a particular equipment to to find the water on the moon and i guess so i can understand that i guess i'm still wondering like is like okay so it sounds like jazmin's answer was was the right answer is is the microscope like do we say both of them or do we say like student "
4242,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh interesting okay gotcha so like you would say both okay interesting way "
4245,420.2,Oliver,,"to make your answer very clear and to clarify any misconceptions ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but thanks so much for working with us it was really want to work "
4247,420.2,Oliver,,,"was great thank you "
4249,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astral which is pretty cool "
4255,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that with the small machine that they use to discover the you know what i mean they said that that was it so i think it's really important that with "
4258,310.1,Chris,,"that is a very good answer you remembered from your text and you elaborated by restating the question thank you ","well i was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and i changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background now even though i know that like they use lots of other stuff it's clear that you know what i mean that the lunar orbiter is is in the text so i guess i wasn't quite sure i didn't quite catch student and but it sounds like it was important to rephrase it "
4266,310.1,Oliver,,,"you want me to ask a question about the text um so i guess like one question i have so i'm still a little torn about the microscope um i guess the question i have is that in the text right they say don't in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close i guess i'm wondering like you know like how did they find um well it's kind of confusing as they say like you wouldn't be able to see it unless you are looking straight at it or even if you were looking straight at it so like what did they use the microscope for "
4272,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i think that that's where they said you know you have to look really close that catches so if they put it on the lunar orbit that they still found it using it sounds like something else so they don't say it the texts like if it's if it's true or something they're like they just say it's a lunar orbit so i think i think that's the best answer because i think i feel like i'm getting "
4280,520.1,Jazmin,,"okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming ","student do you think the state but basically one thing i would say just that to farrah's queestion they use the lunar orbiter to get to the war like you can't find it with the microscope you have to you have to find you have to discover it so and then use the like what we would use like so i think what i would use is basically like we have to close it right and then we have to restate the question which is really hard you know "
4284,420.2,Jazmin,,"So just with write down the question and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question. ","can you show us "
4290,420.2,Oliver,,,"um i don't i'm not sure now i'm really interested in in learning how to do that question Yeah. "
4294,420.2,,,,"oh i don't think you can share the screen i "
4296,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah "
4300,510.1,Oliver,,"for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question to answer the question using the race method you restate the question ","um well it sounds like the lunar orbiter is the right answer and even if i'm not totally 100 sure why so you would say scientists use the lunar orbit "
4302,510.1,Oliver,,,"scientists use the lunar orbiter oh okay yeah so scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and you say like right back scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
4307,520.1,Luis,,"how can you use your knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson ","it's a good question well the first thing i would do is i would restate the question i would say like okay so if the question asked this then i got it i got to answer that question because my response didn't really answer the question i was saying like the scientists found craters below water so it didn't really answer what you asked so i guess it might answer can't answer the question then it's like okay like that's not the answer you know what i mean "
4317,520.1,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we do i really wanted to thank you for working and like in particular i wanted to thank you for like being really clear about like why you were concerned about like what were the things that you you know what i mean like what you wanted us to be focused on and like where we were focused instead and that was really clear and and you also gave us like class or how to like improve our answer you know what i mean like you gave us a lot of ways that we could make our answers better like both being more accurate but then also like you know like restating the question that a lot of booze and be found like just saying the question back because then things make make more sense you know what i mean so it was really cool working with you and you are also so patient with like student who can be kind of like says a lot of crazy things so thank you so much "
4320,520.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
4323,520.1,Chris,,,"hi how are you "
4325,520.1,Chris,,,"doing well thank you "
4327,520.1,Luis,,,"it was fun but i have a question "
4329,520.1,Luis,,,"um i don't think that i should be in this class like i already know all about space and like everything there is to know i don't think i need any help "
4331,520.1,Luis,,,"well i was saying that the scientists would have to use like i'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that i already know before like ever doing the reading "
4334,520.1,Farrah,,,"um so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely "
4336,520.1,Oliver,,,"i answered the same as student "
4338,520.1,Chris,,,"so i went to nasa so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff like i already know about all that stuff "
4340,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so i said that nasa used like a small machine "
4344,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay we read through it but um i have a question if that's okay "
4346,520.1,Farrah,,,"so my answer about the microscope i just i'm not quite understanding why my answer is wrong "
4350,520.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so it says um it says on paragraph in paragraph two "
4352,520.1,Jazmin,,,"it says basically that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4354,520.1,Chris,,,"um well i just i feel like we're talking about stuff that that we know like cuz i went to nasa with my dad and i feel like we're missing stuff that like we have to use "
4357,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so it's the lunar orbiter "
4362,520.1,Chris,,,"well i was going to answer the earlier question i know where they found the water "
4364,520.1,Farrah,,,"so i was gonna say um so did they use the the microscope to discover the water as well or did they use it for something else "
4366,520.1,Farrah,,,"a microscope "
4368,520.1,Chris,,,"um so i was just gonna say like that basically i can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like student said did they have astronauts in it did they need all that stuff "
4370,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah that makes sense that makes sense okay so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all "
4372,520.1,Oliver,,,"um so they found the water in polar craters "
4374,520.1,Oliver,,,"um it's at the top and the bottom "
4376,520.1,Oliver,,,"um do you mean for the the three paragraphs or in one paragraph "
4378,520.1,Oliver,,,"well i guess the central idea is that um the water is that there's water on the moon and the lunar orbiter found it and the microscope was used to look at it "
4380,520.1,Oliver,,,"awesome "
4382,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i do like i feel like maybe like i kind of jumped the gun like i kind of was saying like you know i know all this stuff but didn't really read the text so i feel like now i understand a little better "
4388,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for for being so patient as we all work together and for helping us to listen to each other's answers and kind of use each other's answers to help our own answers sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and it was really special to be able to work with you and to have you encouraged us to listen to each other so um i really appreciate that and i think class else does "
4391,520.1,Luis,,,"i do have a question so um here's what i was thinking um i know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class "
4393,520.1,Jazmin,,,"well what i read was in paragraph two and it said in the first paragraph that nasa sent a small machine "
4395,520.1,Jazmin,,,"sure okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater should i keep reading "
4399,520.1,Chris,,,"um well like i guess i guess no cuz like i guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water "
4404,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so i said that nasa sent a small machine and then when i was reading i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
4406,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah no problem "
4410,520.1,Luis,,,"Um, okay. So lunar orbiter. the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so like that's what the lunar orbiter does it flies up and it orbits the moon "
4414,520.1,Luis,,,"like maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments "
4416,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um i i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i thought the microscope discovered it and also the yeah i thought the microscope discovered the water "
4418,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so it's paragraph three and it says the water is the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4420,520.1,Farrah,,,"no i guess not "
4422,520.1,Chris,,,"well i guess i was just wondering kind of i mean kind of like student like i don't know like i went to nasa with my dad and like we basically like went and studied all the exhibits and stuff so like i just know like outside of the reading that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff "
4426,520.1,Oliver,,,"sure okay so paragraph two um let's see which part just like the whole one "
4428,520.1,Oliver,,,"okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one "
4431,520.1,Oliver,,,"oh like to look at to like look for something "
4434,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so i think if you're investigating it's like how you're finding something so you went off and looked for something "
4443,520.1,Oliver,,,"well i guess you know what it is is it water And so I guess like that's where basically like investigate can you find it, but also study it, but you have to find it and then study So what I wanted to add was just that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us. that sometimes we can really frustrate our science teacher but like you were so patient with like student i don't think student did the reading so i think like it was really nice like how patient you were and like how you like brought all of our answers together so that we could better understand each other that was really cool so thank you because it was really nice to be with my classmates we don't always get along "
4448,520.1,Luis,,,"um well i was just gonna say that i kind of know like all about space i don't think i need to be in this class "
4454,520.1,Luis,,,"okay so um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4457,520.1,Jazmin,,,"they sent the lunar orbiter "
4459,520.1,Jazmin,,,"a scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon "
4462,520.1,Chris,,,"oh i was just gonna say the same thing "
4464,520.1,Oliver,,,"the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
4467,520.1,Farrah,,,"so the lunar orbiter landed at the south pole and it looks for ice water "
4469,520.1,Farrah,,,"it's it's the same thing it's just that ice is frozen water and i guess i just i wanted to ask i think i'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong "
4472,520.1,Farrah,,,"well it says it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover so i said okay the keyword is equipment and discover and i thought what's equipment and i saw the microscope and i know that you use the microscope to see stuff and they said the water was microscopic so you couldn't see without the microscope so i was thinking like you have to see it to find it you know what i mean "
4477,310.1,Farrah,,"i can see exactly why you would say that because it does say the water is microscopic and you would use a microscope to see it ","oh i guess i guess not cause it didn't say that they found it with the microscope it sounds like they found it with something else with the lunar orbiter right "
4481,310.1,Chris,,,"um well actually it was more of a question "
4483,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i guess it was that i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists like oxygen tanks at masks and suits and stuff and i was wondering like that wasn't in the reading and i was wondering like did they use that to find the water "
4489,410.3,Farrah,,"well i can see how if you went to nasa and you actually saw all of those things i can understand why you would think that because there's a lot of things that you probably learned but when we're answering questions we probably should refer back to our the reading that we were given to find out answers that we need you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely there's where student found her answer but the microscope was just to be able to see the water after they found it we're back to number two ","the lunar orbiter "
4491,410.3,Farrah,,,"and i'm so sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with thank you "
4495,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah well i was just gonna say that like i think i kind of got all this figured out by now so i think i'm good "
4499,410.3,Luis,,,"so okay so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen "
4506,420.2,Luis,,"Okay, I understand. And I see why you would say that, how would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable or could be valuable on the moon ","so like i didn't well i guess like that it would be valuable because you could use all those things like hydrogen you can use for rocket fuel and oxygen you can use to breathe Yeah, well, I think so. it sounds like i should say like what it does so that you know people understand like what like you know like what i'm trying to say so i guess i didn't have like a complete answer "
4509,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah absolutely okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
4511,420.2,Luis,,,"um well it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen oh they use both for rocket fuel "
4513,420.2,Luis,,,"they could breathe it "
4516,420.2,Jazmin,,,"and i just i'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer "
4518,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
4525,310.1,Jazmin,,"i see where you got that answer ","i think it's valuable yeah i think i was just wondering like if if i know that it's valuable like how do i structure like my answer it how do i say the answer so that it uses evidence you were reminding us to use evidence did i do it right or do i need to adjust it "
4530,420.2,Jazmin,,"perhaps you could have worded it by saying water is valuable or could be valuable ","i can read it to you is that helpful "
4533,420.2,Jazmin,,,"of course the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
4535,420.2,Chris,,,"what i was ok so i was i read that they were possibly going to have a base on the moon by 2024 which i think that could be really useful "
4537,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i i heard that somewhere else "
4545,430.3,Oliver,,"okay so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph so let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question ","um well i actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using evidence and really helping us to clarify like what we were thinking and and like what kind of ideas perhaps like you really help us to sort of think about like like how did we come to this answer and by thinking about like that you helped us to make like such better answers and like i think that class had a deeper understand like don't you agree class like i think class agrees that like class like you know what i mean understand better and like especially with like student just now like it was really cool how you were asking him like you know like how did he come to his answer so i think student like understand even more and i know that i like was really interested in that conversation so thank you so much for working with us "
4548,430.3,Jazmin,,,"we're really excited to see "
4550,430.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
4559,530.1,Farrah,,"okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting your answer ","okay so basically what i did so good my initial answer was scientists use the lunar orbiter nope sorry you need a scientist tool for the microscope to look really looks and then i said after after class with you i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon and so i did that because you help me understand that the scientific tool that it with the microscope was not the equipment they use to discover the walk so after we work together i realized that it was the lunar orbit that helped to discover "
4564,510.1,Jazmin,,"we look really closely at those keywords in our question ","i'm discovering like when you find them but like it's when you find them for the first time "
4570,510.1,Jazmin,,"remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text ","i started a couple things like i changed my answer to so basically i was like at first i said this small ship for nasa and option but then you helped us look at like how we needed to use the question and like use that to answer it so i'd said basically that like scientists for nasa us the lunar orbit to discover water on the because the lunar orbiter is the equipment that takes you know what i mean like and that was more accurate like i kind of had it right but i didn't i didn't say the actual equipment and they were asked like the name "
4580,510.1,Farrah,,"remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer ","so i basically so i was thinking about what word is like discover so i i found that the word okay so it says like in paragraph two it says nasa set this ball she called the lunar orbiter to best which is kind of like dis discover yeah don't let go and find something and so i thought investigate was important because basically like you know what i mean it says like that's what they that that's what they discover and then when i was looking at the microscope originally i was like oh that's because they had to look really closely but they had to look closely like after they found right "
4583,510.1,Chris,,,"well i actually have a question "
4586,510.1,Chris,,,"my question was like okay so i know because i went so with like that that scientists use oxygen tanks and stuff you know what i mean equipment like that because i was wondering like that's not in the reading like did they leave it out or you know what i mean like is that is that right or is that just like i guess i don't want to understand "
4590,410.1,Chris,,"they weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space so yes you're right they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that because there is no oxygen in space but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space ","because it's it's not in the right so even if it was true right okay "
4594,410.1,Oliver,,,"i'm so sorry but we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you for working with us it was really awesome to have a chance to talk so thank you so much "
4597,410.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut just pretty cool "
4604,410.1,Oliver,,,"i think valuable means like useful it can also mean like you know like something that costs a lot like it could be really expensive "
4610,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so basically well i guess okay so you're asking is it useful well water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and in oxygen and those are both really useful in space so yeah i think it's us "
4614,410.1,Luis,,,"um i'm like whoa okay didn't say it i don't remember mike my dad uses it or something okay did he say oh oh oh you could you could breathe breathe the oxygen "
4617,410.1,Jazmin,,,"um to basically we is it the answer to the question or like why are you "
4619,410.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water also you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon "
4623,410.1,Chris,,,"i'm yeah i mean yeah like water is heavy and so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships like they don't have to carry any water they could just go to the moon and get the water there "
4626,410.1,Oliver,,,"um okay so i was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready "
4631,410.1,Oliver,,,"um well i guess the waters not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading you have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question it's like microscopic so like it seems like it would be really tricky and and i guess the other thing is that because it's ice like you have to collect that and you have to you know you have to like like i guess melt it you know what i mean like you have to do all that stuff wall like before you can use so i it's not ready to us why don't think it's a very useful "
4634,310.1,Farrah,,"i like your thinking that is awesome you used details from our text to support your thinking so that's awesome ","um so basically i thought that okay so my answer is also know and that i guess i feel a little different from student is like it wouldn't be useful for a long time "
4638,310.1,Farrah,,,"well okay so you know how they were saying in the reading kind of like what i've said like they need like all this there's all these processes to to break it down and do stuff with it so i do think that it might be useful i bench but like right now like i don't think the evidence is very fancy because it's like saying you know can you use it can you use it now i don't think it's very good until we figure out how to how to make it useful and we haven't done "
4642,310.1,Chris,,"so awesome job using evidence from the text as well ","um yeah so i just basically was just thinking also that that like water can be broken down into arts i virgin and oxygen i agree with with student i think there's lots of reasons why it would be useful "
4645,310.1,Chris,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next box i really wanted to make sure that i was able to share with you hi "
4647,310.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing okay "
4652,310.1,Luis,,,"i do i do "
4655,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so okay my name is student and actually so i kind of know what equipment is like it's stuff that you it's like machines and tools and things that you use but my real question is like i don't think i should be in this class like i know already all about space and i know like everything there is to know about space so like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help "
4662,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah ok so a microscope is okay so in the text it said a microscope is a scientific tool and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's like something that you look at something that's really small but i have a question like why is my answer wrong like i feel like my answers right because like you have to use like like microscope to see the water "
4669,310.1,Oliver,,,"um okay so basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it "
4677,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i can see it but here's the thing that i was thinking is the i thought that thesmall machine that nasa sent was the thing that discovered the water is it the microscope but like i think that they discovered it with the machine "
4686,310.1,Chris,,,"so i was just kind of wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we like went and looked at places and we looked at like exhibits and stuff so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff but they don't i don't know like i already know that so i'm wondering like maybe that's the equipment that they used to discover water yeah "
4689,310.1,Chris,,,"okay "
4694,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay so we have to go to lunch unfortunately but i just wanted to take a moment and like i just wanted to thank you for like spending this time with us like you really took the time to listen to all of our ideas and you really like helped us to listen to each other's ideas and like even though i didn't really read the text like you were very patient with me and still brought me into the conversation which was pretty cool so i just wanted to thank you and um yeah i hope that we work with you again "
4697,310.1,Oliver,,,"hello how are you "
4699,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm good we're working on this question about what scientists what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon "
4702,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so i have a question like i know all the stuff about space like practically all you can possibly know like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help with this "
4704,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i can do that "
4706,310.1,Luis,,,"well okay so here's what i know is like probably they had to use like i'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use like stuff like that like gloves and like helmets and things i think that's what they had to use "
4710,310.1,Luis,,,"well "
4714,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so i think it's i think it's the microscope i think it's the microscope Um, okay. So I saw it in paragraph three, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So I'm not totally sure like why my answers not right. "
4717,420.3,Jazmin,,"why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate can someone see what they brought ","so what i said what i saw is that nasa send a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
4719,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well so i think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water which was pretty cool "
4721,420.3,Oliver,,,"um so they basically used the microscope that student mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes "
4723,420.3,Farrah,,,"um i think i began to see but i'm still kind of confused because so if they use the lunar orbiter to to find it they couldn't see it without the microscope like they had to go out and look at the crystals right "
4725,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place "
4727,420.3,Farrah,,,"gotcha okay that that that makes a little more sense i think i think that makes sense um "
4731,510.1,Chris,,"often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story ","yes student yeah okay so i think like for okay i went to nasa with my dad and we looked around at like all the exhibits and all the stuff and i kind of like i know from my own like reading and from my like visit that you have to use all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like what student said so like i don't know like that does that fit into the answer "
4734,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i guess like for me it's like um i didn't really read it because i kind of knew all this stuff but i guess there's more in the reading so like the stuff about the orbiter and the microscope like i guess it didn't really think about that "
4740,510.1,Bennett,,,"um so we have to go to lunch in just a second but i wanted to just thank you for working with us today because i'm sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher because we don't always work together but today you really asked us to think about each other's answers and really kind of listen to each other and and be patient with each other and kind of like even student like didn't do the reading like you were like really nice to him and i just wanted to thank you because it felt really safe to like put out our ideas so i just wanted to thank you for that all right welcome back so how did that feel "
4744,510.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
4746,510.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah yeah sure i'll tell class what i know "
4755,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh i don't remember where it is i mean i guess i could just i could look back at the story again "
4760,510.1,Luis,,,"well i was thinking that you know how i learned a lot about science is by i'm watching youtube videos and and and watching the show on on on nova show on pbs so i was thinking that maybe student needs to watch more more science videos "
4768,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay i'm working i'm looking at the text and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
4770,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah it's me miss bailey i just looked at the text i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
4773,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh ok ok "
4779,510.1,Oliver,,,"equipment "
4781,510.1,Jazmin,,,"i was thinking discover "
4783,510.1,Chris,,,"well for me i was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question "
4788,510.1,Farrah,,,"i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i got that i'm in the third paragraph "
4790,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah to look at it yeah "
4794,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
4799,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i just mean like when we were saying our answers out loud like um i had the exact same sentence that i have circled on my my my text to the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4802,510.1,Oliver,,,"um well you did say that um you can't look if you're looking at the water than your you have to first that's the second stop so then um i guess i have to look for the first step i gosh "
4808,510.1,Chris,,,"Well, your side equipment. okay yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
4813,420.2,Jazmin,,"That's true, but we want to focus on the text. Let's see. student you wrote that nasa sent a small machine that's very good so maybe we need to investigate look a little further to see what is that machine called ","okay i should look at it i don't remember "
4818,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay so i think it's that i'm at the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4820,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry my spelling but i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we have to go "
4822,420.2,All,,,"thank you all bye "
4826,420.2,,,,"it was good we had a chocolate chip cookie and and we also have lasagna so it was delicious "
4828,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm okay "
4830,420.2,Luis,,,"oh "
4835,420.2,Chris,,,"i think water again is the keyword and may be valuable "
4840,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um i think that um is a keyword and the second one and maybe moon because we're talking about water on the moon "
4842,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay i think my answer i chose i'm valuable it's important one "
4847,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm gonna say convincing Evidence evidence, our teachers always asked "
4849,420.2,Luis,,,"evidence as one it's like something that you can pro you know it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it "
4856,420.2,Jazmin,,,"we can tell you our answers to if that "
4859,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay well i'll go i'll go first cuz i'm still kind of confused it's me student okay i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
4863,420.2,Jazmin,,,"why is it wrong "
4866,420.2,Jazmin,,"so one strategy we could use let's let's work together with student let's help her her figure out what we could add to this okay so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text ","well i know i know that i'm supposed to look for the keywords and the text and i guess that's why i'm confused because i feel like i did that "
4871,420.2,Jazmin,,,"cuz my answer i said astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water okay and then in the paragraph number four it says future astronauts could drink this water i added on another detail because i know that's another strategy we're supposed to do is is because the last question you said that i needed to add more details and so i "
4875,310.1,Chris,,"One place we can look is exactly where you look so you found the right spot to look under the section. Water is a valuable resource right ","Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore. "
4877,310.1,Oliver,,,"i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
4882,410.2,Chris,,"wow that's very possible and student you did find some good information because water can be very heavy that is true but we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable ","okay it takes "
4884,410.2,Chris,,,"no no i guess not "
4894,410.2,Farrah,,,"is me student i see the last sentence kind of after student and chris's it says having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things so is that the right answer "
4896,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah having more room would be valuable "
4898,410.2,Oliver,,,"i agree what student "
4901,510.1,Oliver,,"we don't want to just say we agree it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something ","okay i agree with some out because i do think that um well the thing that i'm so after student said a thing about drinking the water and then student to think about the water being heavy i'm done it does say more room i mean i have to share a room with my two brothers and so if i had more room in my in my room than i would think that would be valuable "
4907,510.1,Chris,,,"okay um let's let's really i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go again um but it's me student i did want to say thanks for for for hearing our ideas like i feel like you you listen to everybody's ideas and make us feel like valued oh like the water but also that you had me and student kind of look back at at the story so we could find more evidence and build on each other's ideas and i think that was helpful too yeah "
4909,510.1,All,,,"okay bye "
4911,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i just wanted to say i just wanted to remind you and class that my dad is actually an astronaut "
4916,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen "
4919,510.1,Luis,,,"um you know i think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel that i think it's convincing that they have like you know what they talk about with whay you can do yeah i think it's convincing "
4921,430.2,Luis,,"good so with your answer what i want you to do is to describe the reasons why it's valuable when you split oxygen and hydrogen does that make sense student ","oh yeah like using the evidence yeah yeah that makes sense "
4924,430.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
4927,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah i'll try i'll see what i can find "
4929,430.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i said that um no like i didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet "
4932,430.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i could try to look for reasons um i just think that like it just seems like it's not you know what i mean cuz it's not ready yet like it would take such a long time to be useful you know what i mean so it didn't seem very convincing because it seems like we'd hav to use but yeah i can look and see "
4938,430.2,Jazmin,,,"i said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water "
4944,430.2,Farrah,,,"um so my answer was i guess no that it wasn't very convincing because kind of like what student said like we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time you know "
4946,430.2,Farrah,,,"i guess that's a good question i guess it could be valuable in the future "
4948,430.2,Farrah,,,"you certainly have more spaceships "
4952,430.2,Chris,,,"um yeah i guess i was thinking like well let's see what was i gonna say i was gonna say that well i guess what i found was that water can be broken down into two parts so hydrogen and oxygen so i guess i was going to say that like yeah that's stuff that also is useful "
4954,420.2,Chris,,"good so you're right it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen now let's go a little bit further with that answer and can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence ","oh yeah yeah okay "
4958,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yet so basically so and student was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen so i guess like that was something that just says like it was even more useful than just using the water like you can use water and then you can use oxygen and then you can also use hydrogen and unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just really wanted to thank for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like hearing all of our answers and really taking the time to listen to what each of us was saying "
4960,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i just wanted to say that like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space "
4962,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so basically what i said was um let's see what did i say i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
4966,430.3,Luis,,"could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment so instead of oxygen tanks let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon does that make sense student ","um yeah is there somewhere that because i'm not sure where to look is there somewhere i should be looking "
4968,420.3,Luis,,"so um the sections are labeled 1 2 3 4 5 and six let's take a look at section three and see if you can find an example of the equipment they used to find water on the moon ","okay "
4971,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine "
4974,420.3,Chris,,"so look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question ","um yeah so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
4977,430.3,Farrah,,"okay so they did find water on the moon but can you find what equipment they use to find that water on the moon okay can you look back in your texts and see if you can actually find the equipment ","on i was just wondering because i guess i'm still not sure why my answer's wrong "
4979,430.3,Farrah,,,"yeah so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
4983,430.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
4985,430.3,Farrah,,,"well i guess like i mean i guess you could say like you know you said equipment like definitely microscopes you know it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at because the water was was microscopic right "
4987,430.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i think so "
4990,430.3,Luis,,,"um well i just kind of kept looking around and look what i was like i i looked in paragraph three looking but i was like it looks like they use the microscope but like i don't know like did they use it to discover like it seems like there's a lot of equipment that they used "
4992,430.3,Chris,,,"yeah i i kind of had that like because i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading but oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that "
4994,410.2,Chris,,"so they do use a lot of things but you didn't look for the specific equipment that the scientists used to discover the water ","yeah i think so i guess i was wondering like did they did they not use suits or like i guess i was just wondering like should we say from what we know or you know what i mean "
4997,410.2,Oliver,,"yeah so i mean you do have a point there that they used other things too but i was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon ","we unfortunately have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us hi how are you "
4999,410.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing well we're excited to work with you "
5002,410.2,Luis,,,"oh oh i have a question and can i just kind of see just like one thing real quick "
5004,410.2,Luis,,,"okay so i like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space like i know everything practically there is to know that i don't really need any help "
5007,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yes i can hear you just fine "
5010,410.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so in paragraph two nasa scientists small machine called lunar orbiter so it says lunar orbiter right "
5012,410.2,Jazmin,,,"great "
5014,410.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah so here's my question so i don't really understand why i'm why my answer is wrong "
5017,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i mean i i guess yeah but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope you know like they have to be able to see it in order to study it "
5019,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh well they sent up it sounds like student just like the lunar orbiter "
5023,420.2,Oliver,,"right so maybe include that with your answer in the microscope ","so does that mean that they use both of them to discover the water or did the one of them discover it and one of them did something else i'm a little confused "
5026,420.2,Jazmin,,,"does that mean that my answer is wrong like did the microscope do the discovering or was it the lunar orbiter "
5031,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i already know a lot about space so i should be honest "
5033,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah sure um well they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon "
5037,420.2,Luis,,,"hmm i'm not sure "
5041,420.2,Luis,,,"um i don't know "
5044,420.2,Luis,,,"lunar orbitre "
5048,420.2,Jazmin,,,"right yeah yeah ice and water it's the same thing right okay i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5051,420.2,Jazmin,,"but looking more specifically you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does so your answer was right on it you just wanted to add some more detail to it ","okay "
5054,420.2,Oliver,,,"well um i mean i think that i had the right answer so um i guess i don't know why my answers wrong too okay um i had the same answer as student "
5060,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay one was used for to find the water any other thing was used for something different right which which one is the right one "
5062,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh but i guess so how do you figure that out is it just because you're the teacher you know you know "
5064,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5066,420.2,Chris,,,"so i mean that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment you know "
5069,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay okay okay so thanks teacher it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for working with us "
5071,420.2,All,,,"bye "
5077,420.2,Luis,,,"oh not so much a question i just wanted to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
5080,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah that's why i know so much about space okay "
5085,420.2,Luis,,,"um well for me i dont know convincing evidence "
5091,420.2,Farrah,,,"i was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that um that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like and they need to study it so it seems like they got they there it's it's nowhere near ready you know there's got to be a lot of time left since i got to have a plan and a study "
5097,420.2,Jazmin,,"so when i'm looking for my answer you want to look for details that will tell you how the water is going to be valuable ","well i thought that you know that they could like make them own garden you know and so they could grow vegetables and pinks "
5104,420.2,Oliver,,,"i was in paragraph one it says water is heavy and it says that future astronauts could drink this water "
5110,420.2,Jazmin,,"so you class are all giving really good details but we want to say give like a yes or no question if you think that it is valuable and all of your details put together does say yes it is valuable because they can use it for surviving so you class are giving really good details for that they can use it for rocket fuel it can be split apart ","so my answer is right "
5113,420.2,Chris,,,"What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships. "
5115,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so i would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink "
5117,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i also know like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen "
5124,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh wow okay i guess i hear what you're saying about why student and student are right but i guess i don't know where they found the answer okay how did they do that "
5129,420.2,Farrah,,,"so they're using their background knowledge so me and student get it because we don't know as much about space as then "
5134,420.2,Oliver,,"maybe but you can also use the passage remember too you can use your reading passage to help you figure out how it would be valuable ","all oh ok ok i think i think i understand so it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for kind of explaining what me and student need to work on well i guess all of us that we should um keep reading the passage course i'm even though we don't know as much about spaces student and student they weren't right either because they needed to put all their ideas together "
5137,420.2,All,,,"okay expand our answers okay thank you so much teacher okay bye "
5143,430.2,Luis,,"it was a small machine student so you were close also but that small machine had a name and we need to find that exact name in the passage ","ah yeah i see it i have a quick question though "
5145,430.2,Luis,,,"um okay so here's the thing i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like so much about space that i don't really think i need like any help with this i think i already know like a lot about this stuff "
5147,430.2,Luis,,,"well i guess i didn't really like do the reading exactly i kind of just like had my knowledge but um so i guess no "
5149,430.2,Luis,,,"okay gotcha "
5152,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay i think so when we were rereading i saw that in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
5154,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so um "
5156,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay so here's the thing though um so it i was saying that it was the microscope that discovered the water i'm not sure like what my answer is wrong "
5161,410.1,Farrah,,"but it wasn't the exact answer that was to the question your answer would have been so there was a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water ","oh so like they like found it using the lunar orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it "
5166,410.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so like here's my thinking like man like so my dad like took me to nasa and we checked out like all these different exhibits and stuff like that which was awesome but like here's the thing like um like like what student was saying like so i know that they have to use like the astronauts when they go out on the moon they have to use like oxygen tanks and um like you know like spacesuits and fuel so like i guess i'm wondering like isn't that what they used to discover the to discover the the the water "
5170,410.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i was wondering with my very first answer when i said it was the small machine why was that not right "
5177,510.1,Oliver,,"but again you want to use context clues to find the exact name of that small machine when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on ","um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher he says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful in the way that you like um like student i'm not sure he did the reading and i feel like i'm you really were were kind with his answer and really helped like all of our answers like worked on one another tp kind of get a class answer together which was pretty cool because like sometimes we don't always listen to each other so it was really neat to like listen to each other's answers thanks to the way you were teaching us so just wanted to thank you "
5179,510.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
5181,510.1,Oliver,,,"how are you "
5183,510.1,Oliver,,,"we're good we're discussing um what equipment id scientists use to discover water on the moon "
5187,510.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's the thing um i think that um i should really be in this class because i don't really need any help like i basically know like all about space and so like i kind of like have all this knowledge so i don't think i really need the help okay "
5190,510.1,Luis,,,"that sounds good "
5194,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so my answer was the nasa scientists small machine and i noticed that in the reading that they they had that that was a piece of equipment that was used to discover water like they uses the the machine to go in like to find the water "
5197,510.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah okay so basically the microscope so i was looking at paragraph three and they said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i i thought you have to be able to see the water in order to discover it so i said the microscope "
5200,510.1,Farrah,,,"so um yeah it's it's speaking to me since i think but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it "
5203,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh gotcha okay "
5205,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay so like here's the thing like i'm kind of thinking like um so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at all the equipment and stuff so i know that there's a lot of there's like a lot of equipment that they use like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i guess like did they not use those things "
5214,510.1,Chris,,,"okay okay i think oh i should probably read the the reading like a little closer maybe "
5216,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i guess you could like and i guess it's like um i guess just wondering like did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe you know what i mean "
5223,510.1,Oliver,,,"yes okay so the question was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon and the scientists used a small machine to discover the water on the moon and they use the microscope um wait student can you help yeah so um yeah so basically they they use the small machine to discover the water and they use the microscope to like study it "
5228,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yes student basically we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to thank you really quickly for working with us today and specifically like you really were patient with class like sometimes we give like our science teacher like he says they're stress hives and i feel like you were really patient with us and you also they were really interested in our answers like even when we weren't like totally correct or like we were sort of figuring it out like you really listen to all of us which is kind of cool so do you think thank you so much "
5230,510.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5232,510.1,Luis,,,"that was me student "
5237,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah sure okay so i was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know cuz they can't breathe on the moon and so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do any type of exploration you know um did you hear my answer teacher or do you want me to say it again "
5239,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah exactly you can't go to the mon without an oxygen tank "
5241,410.2,Luis,,"but i'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon because to me they needed the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space i don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water ","well i mean they can't walk around on the moon without oxygen tanks to breathe "
5245,410.2,Jazmin,,"the point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts i don't think the intention is for it to discover water ","yeah yeah now okay teacher "
5247,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't know why my answer is wrong "
5252,410.2,Jazmin,,"so i would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete it was lacking just a small detail on what specific machine they sent ","okay i guess i thought we were all here cuz our answers were wrong i thought that's why the teacher told us to come to this small class "
5260,410.2,Chris,,"student over there said oxygen tanks now that is equipment and it did help them you know get to the moon to discover the water but he needed to be a little bit more specific on the actual equipment that discovered the water and your answer said they sent a small machine which is true it's a little bit more detailed than luis's we just need that extra bit of i guess what specific machine ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5267,410.2,Oliver,,"so back to you savannah and student the microscope helps them look closer at the water but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water ","you were about to tell us your suggestion to all of us "
5272,410.2,Oliver,,"You read the read the question first, maybe look at some key words. So like this question. So equipment. So, all right, I'm looking for equipment when I go to read. And then I'm going to read the passage and maybe highlight or circle any equipment that I see as I am reading, and then go back to the question and read it again. I think. I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific. ","okay oh i just looked at the time and it's time for us to go to lunch um but thank you for taking the time to work with us "
5274,410.2,Luis,,,"hi i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut "
5277,410.2,Luis,,,"i know a lot about space "
5280,410.2,Chris,,,"you're a really good teacher "
5288,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay but it's not it's not ready yet because i'm one you look in paragraph paragraph six it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money um they need to study the moon surface and built new equipment do you think it would be a good investment you'll decide well no it's not ready cause it'll take a lot of time and money so so no it's my answer "
5295,410.1,Jazmin,,"i like that you said no because it's going to take a lot of time and money but the question you answered was do you think it would be a good investment the question was is water valuable ","Well, I also think that he could use water to grow things so we can have a moon garden on the moon. "
5298,410.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah that's a good point i didn't think of how the heck "
5300,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't know if you still wanted to talk to student and student but well i think that my answer was a good answer "
5302,410.1,Jazmin,,,"good i think i had the right answer i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water so why am i in this class "
5313,310.1,Chris,,"so i think that you and student and student all said that yes it's valuable and then you gave a reason why you thought it was valuable so i like that you justified your answer Because he answered, whether it was a good investment. I don't think you may answer the actual question of water being valuable, but I think we all had um i like that we all had our reasons and justified our reasons you said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text ","great great i just thought of something else okay from the story water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
5326,420.2,Oliver,,"yeah and that's what student said he said it could be useful because it can be broken down now he could have extended his answer a little bit more and said what is valuable about breaking it down and said what is valuable about breaking it down ","i don't think i saw that part i don't remember that part either honestly rocket fuel oh yeah it does it says it right here you're right where do you see that student middle of the paragraph it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel oh ok ok so i just have to add that sentence to my answer and then my answer is ok all i have to do is add the thing about rocket fuel to my answer water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they make rocket fuel that's it "
5332,310.1,Oliver,,"I mean, the question was really yes or no and you just gave like yes, it can be broken down. And if I were reading it Or grading the question I'd want to know what's valuable about the water being able to be broken down. and you gave it how it could be valuable, but maybe not so much how it was used. So that's the only thing I would add to your answer. of the water and how the water could be used ","okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch um i did want to say all thank you for explaining what all of us need it to work on i'm like i know that i didn't answer the right question um but even didn't answer the question but he needed more details and his answer "
5334,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay well we'll see you next time bye "
5337,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
5341,310.1,Jazmin,,,"can you say it again "
5346,310.1,Luis,,,"oh can i ask a question real quick "
5348,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so here's the here's the thing like i know a lot about space already like i know all this stuff and so i don't really think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
5351,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah we can do that "
5354,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so i my answer was in paragraph three and i said on that said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you need the the microscope to see the water "
5359,310.1,Oliver,,,"um so yeah i basically did the same thing as student i looked at the same paragraph and it said that um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i figured that the equipment that they studied the um the water with was a microscope "
5363,310.1,Chris,,"you summarized very well ","yeah so like i guess there's like all these craters they got all this kind of water and all this stuff like um so they got like lots of water on the moon "
5365,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah like i think they just use basically like um like spacesuits and like i know cuz i went to nasa so like they use like oxygen tanks and and masks and suits like to go flying around in space "
5370,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i kind of know about space um i didn't really read that Yeah, I can. I can do that. "
5373,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i was just wondering like why my answer might be wrong because it sounds like like farrah's answer and oliver's answer might be right with a microscope but i thought it was the small machine that did the discovery "
5376,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i read it in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
5379,310.1,Jazmin,,"i love how you elaborated a little bit more on your answer that is great ","okay so it was the lunar orbiter so is that what i got wrong is that didn't say the lunar orbiter "
5381,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay gotcha "
5383,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so "
5386,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so i'm just wondering like which one is like so am i right about the lunar orbiter is the how they discovered the water "
5388,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
5390,310.1,Jazmin,,,"did they use the microscope to discover it "
5394,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so basically um i think that well it sounds like the microscope like yeah i think the microscope is how they found it like i think they use both of them to find it they use the orbiter and the microscope to discover the water "
5398,310.1,Luis,,,"well yeah like i think that the thing that they did was they had to use like spacesuits and stuff like so i didn't really even read it i just kind of knew that like they had to use that stuff you know they had to use like space suits and stuff "
5404,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um we can unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we left i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us sometimes like our teachers are always so patient with us but you were really patient and you also made us all i think feel like our answers were really worthwhile even if we weren't totally accurate so i just wanted to thank you because that feels really good when we're trying to learn something so thank you so much "
5408,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i basically like i already know like all sorts of stuff about space and i don't really feel like i need to be in this class because i know all kinds of stuff "
5412,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i can do that "
5426,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah so i came up with the answer because okay so i was looking in paragraph he and i saw that basically by they said that the water that they found on the moon is microscopic and you couldn't see it unless you keep your microphone so i thought that's how they that's how they found the water "
5430,310.1,Chris,,,"oh um well actually i think student was pinnacle "
5434,310.1,Jazmin,,,"just said that i think he raised his hand by accident so what i was gonna say was i was just gonna say that like i don't really understand like why my answers wrong "
5441,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
5444,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so basically my response was i circled the same thing as survey "
5450,310.1,Oliver,,,"so yeah i wasn't sure how to make my answer better "
5454,310.1,Farrah,,,"i think that you were saying right well you should use evidence and say like where we we found her answer is that right "
5459,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well yeah i could do that because i actually saw a lot of the same stuff as student so basically what i saw was in the same thing that third paragraph where they were saying that you wouldn't even be able to see the water if you were looking like right at it so that made me think that you had to use a microscope to find the water that to discover the water okay "
5462,420.2,Oliver,,"So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your ","Okay. "
5465,420.2,Chris,,,"yes so i was just gonna say that i went with my dad and so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like you know like masks such said oxygen tanks and i don't know where that goes in my answer "
5468,420.2,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we just really wanted to thank you for working with us thank you so much bye bye thank "
5471,420.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing well how are you "
5474,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's the thing like um i know all about space like a lot about space so like i don't think i really need to be here i don't need any help with anything "
5476,420.2,Luis,,,"um so yeah okay so what i know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything i know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff if you're going to go up into space and like you're out "
5479,420.2,Luis,,,"maybe i didn't maybe i didn't really read the text very much because i kind of knew about space "
5482,420.2,Luis,,"why is it important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question ","yeah yeah i think so "
5487,420.2,Farrah,,,"so i think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it so i'm not really sure like why is my answer like um not right "
5490,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you have to see it you can't see it without microscope "
5495,310.1,Chris,,"very good and you looked back in the text to find your answer and to get all the information ","yeah so i thought i think there's a lot of water in the craters so i think they um they just wanted to study more closely because there's a bunch of water "
5498,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess maybe not very much water so maybe it's not like full of water "
5501,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
5505,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay so in paragraph two in the first sentence it says a nasa sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate "
5507,310.1,Jazmin,,,"that's what that's what i think cuz is like investigate's like discover so i think that's what they said discovered the water "
5509,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah "
5513,310.1,Chris,,,"oh i guess it's not really a question um i mean i guess what we kind of talked about this but like well like i guess like i'm like i went to nasa and when i went to nasa with my dad like i saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so um did they not use those things "
5517,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess i didn't really that makes sense i didn't really read it closely enough because i think i hear what you're saying "
5523,510.1,Luis,,"i think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given ","um yeah so like here's the thing um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go to lunch i just wanted to like thank you because when um sometimes um our science teacher gets really frustrated with us and says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us even though we kind of were trying to like figure out all these different answers and stuff and like um you you were very like patient with me because like i didn't i didn't read the text but i like i had ideas so i just really appreciate like that you were just like really patient with us and really we're spending time to help us so thank you so much "
5528,510.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know about space "
5531,510.1,Luis,,,"okay "
5534,510.1,Jazmin,,,"the principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up but he said that we can just look at the teacher when we're finished "
5537,510.1,Chris,,,"Okay, we talked. I said-- "
5541,510.1,Chris,,,"we just talked about it and i said that it was the craters the craters of was what they used and and student was talking about how astronauts have a lot of different machines that they use and then and then we were done "
5543,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah sure um they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more because i know like a lot more machines too "
5546,510.1,Luis,,,"um let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh so it's a lunar orbiter "
5550,510.1,Farrah,,,"a lunar orbiter Excuse me "
5553,510.1,Farrah,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt but i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
5556,510.1,Farrah,,,"before they saw the microscope "
5558,510.1,Farrah,,,"well normally use the microscope to see the things um "
5561,510.1,Farrah,,,"um nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate keep reading or stop there "
5565,410.1,Chris,,"stop right there so although you're you are correct with you need a microscope to look at her really closely what it equip they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to disover it you are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it the microscope is equipment that they looked really closely at the water with but did they discover the water with the microscope ","um i went to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks well ehtan said that one and like masks they have to wear a mask because they can't breathe in space and um they have to they have to wear these certain types of shoes because there isn't any gravity either so that's all like the stuff that they wear is equipment too "
5567,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
5575,410.1,Oliver,,,"um i'm not i think i'm still not sure about because i have the same answer as student so how did we get the answer i'm not sure i'm sorry It said, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? For the kind of equipment that the scientists used "
5577,410.1,Oliver,,,"um equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon "
5579,410.1,Oliver,,,"to discover the water "
5582,410.1,Oliver,,,"um oh okay oh yeah i guess it says that you use a microscope to look at the water all right "
5585,410.1,All,,,"well i i was looking at the clock just now and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping me to look really closely at the question cuz i didn't i didn't realize i missed part of a question so um thank you bye "
5589,410.1,Luis,,,"wow i was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut so i know all this stuff you know "
5591,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay yeah that sounds cool "
5598,410.1,Jazmin,,,"well i was thinking that you could use water to grow things so that we could have like a garden can you imagine how beautiful it woud be Um lets see. I was looking at...Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing. "
5606,420.3,Chris,,"But what I want you to do is I want you to go back. I want you to underline at least one thing that they said was useful. And if you want to amaze me. I want you to underline two things and raise your hand. Once you're done. ","so i said that you could wait okay um water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen which is a big deal "
5608,420.3,Chris,,,"well you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water that's a big deal "
5611,420.3,Chris,,,"it's this paragraph five but i guess it's the second paragraph this next one it says water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen oh and you could use it as rocket fuel "
5615,420.3,Oliver,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really just wanted to thank you and i wanted to thank you particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking and really helping us like i think that all of us felt like our ideas were really valued today and it really felt like we had time to explain like what we were thinking about in our different ideas like just wanted to thank you for doing that it was really cool and it was really nice to meet you "
5619,420.3,Luis,,,"hi yeah shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
5625,420.3,Jazmin,,,"like lots of things um okay okay well i know that in order for the astronauts to go up into space they have to be on a space shuttle but then the space shuttle also has this other part to it that like has to fall off you know when it's um in order to in order for it to like to go up into space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space so will the the astronauts have to work spacesuits until that some of the kind of equipment that they have to wear a spacesuit so that they can breathe and then we're trying to figure out if we can like do a mission to mars and if there's life on mars where we can read them live um because if we destroy this planet then we might have to move to mars "
5634,420.3,Farrah,,,"um they use microscopes because that was that was in my answer and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
5638,420.3,Farrah,,,"um well in the story it says that well it's talking about the moon and then it says the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so there they are talking about the water on the moon "
5643,310.1,Farrah,,"you're using your deep reading skills to really engage with the text and that's awesome ","reads to herself the moon is still the driest desert on earth the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i'm not sure "
5646,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay reads to herself nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater the ice deposits are very small okay i mean it talks about a machine and this one it talks about a machine and equipment is machine but it doesn't talk about the water "
5650,310.1,Farrah,,,"Okay. oh yeah it says investigate "
5652,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh i'm not sure "
5656,310.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and masks "
5659,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i thought student said they use like a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate "
5661,310.1,Chris,,,"ah well it's a story and i mean the stories about water on the moon so um oh yeah yeah it says it in the second sentence but it will land at the moon yeah "
5668,310.1,Oliver,,,"they use the equipment which is the lunar orbiter student what's up i'm sorry i just heard the timer and i was looking over at the clock and that's our bell at told us on it's it's time to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping us to keep looking back i thought story cuz i thought that i had a good answer but then i listened to you kept telling student and student to look back and look and read it again and read it again so thank you for that "
5671,310.1,Luis,,,"bye oh you're welcome bye um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i need to do this "
5675,410.2,Oliver,,"well so even though you know a lot about space and you know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and microscopes and things like that it's really cool but you have kind of missed the answer about what equipment we need to discover the water on the moon ","um i thought the most interesting thing that i saw was the idea that like there was like water up there that like even though it's like very like microscopic that that may be um it could still be used or it could still be something that like is enough that we could do something with it "
5677,310.1,Chris,,"awesome and i love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good ","um yeah i was really interested in seeing like how they found the water they were trying to like you know what i mean like how they manage to look for it "
5679,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um so i was really interested in like i got like really about how be thinking how cool it would be if you could grow this garden that would be so pretty "
5681,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i think for me like i was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use and i was thinking about like you know that they have other equipment that they use that's not necessarily in the reading but but i know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah "
5684,310.1,Farrah,,"that's exactly right and i love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good ","um so me well i actually have a question i was not sure like i was thinking a lot about it and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5686,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm really closely at the water "
5689,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh that's interesting so okay so the way i was thinking was like that if you i guess okay so if you had to find the water did you have to see it or was there another way maybe to detect "
5696,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right "
5699,420.2,Chris,,"so it's really important when we are answering questions even though you found part of the question stem and your answer you've got to look around it to make sure that's the total ","so i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess i was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well "
5701,410.3,Chris,,"they would have to use a combination of all those things but this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use and what we can do with the water once they found it ","oh "
5704,410.3,Jazmin,,,"That's it. So I just have to say like the full sentence. "
5706,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah sometimes that works but sometimes we have to look around too so yes it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question because we have to also ask a small machine that did what ","um it discovered the water "
5708,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it was it was called the lunar orbiter "
5711,420.2,Luis,,,"which unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun thank you so much um yeah so i think i got all this stuff figured out pretty good so i think i'm good "
5714,310.1,Luis,,"i loved your answer you really used the details in the article you went back and re-read to find that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's exactly right ","oh yeah it's awesome yeah it's really cool that that's a possibility "
5721,310.1,Oliver,,,"important like something that's useful or important yeah "
5729,410.2,Chris,,"your answer doesn't really encompass how water on the moon might be valuable ","some details well okay so we know that like there's a few things that you could do because you could like you could use it to make like rocket fuel you could drink the water there's a lot of stuff you could you could do with it "
5731,410.2,Jazmin,,,"reach every reader you can drink it you can make rocket fuel oh you can breathe it they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen "
5733,310.1,Farrah,,"that's exactly right so like you said your answer student the water is valuable and we really need to discuss why it looks like you've done that in your answer so great job ","i think i just i'm still a little confused "
5739,410.2,Farrah,,"my concern is that you want it to be right now and you're not thinking about the future ","it seems like it would take a lot of money and time it seems like it would be really hard to get class to work together and make it happen but i do think i see what you mean that it is like valuable in theory like no matter when it is "
5742,410.2,Oliver,,,"um well i actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than student and i thought "
5746,410.2,Luis,,,"well i guess i'm not sure like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly "
5754,410.2,Oliver,,,"i see like i gotta say like i gotta say the whole sentence like you like work with student when she needed to say like the whole thing about the lunar orbiter and the small machine like i need to say like what my opinion is and then i need to say like what it could be used is that right Um, well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us to create much more complete answers and like in particular you really asked us to like use evidence from the text and to make sure that we work on yeah backing up our statements with with like actual evidence and things and i think that like everybody's answers got a lot better because of the way that you lead us through that that's the discussion and you also really made us feel valued by making sure that we all like felt like you know like what we were sharing was worthwhile and that was really cool and it was really interesting like to learn new stuff and and to talk about it as a class so thank you so much "
5757,410.2,Luis,,,"excuse me "
5759,410.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5762,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah sure ok paragraph 3 that means the moon is still drier than the rest of oh sorry ok that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
5764,410.2,Chris,,,"no no you need a microscope to look at it "
5766,410.2,Chris,,,"well i had said that they could do it with the craters i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
5768,410.2,Chris,,,"well in that one it was talking about a microscope and how it said the water is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it you need a microscope to look really closely at it "
5770,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh excuse me "
5772,410.2,Farrah,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5774,410.2,Farrah,,,"i'd say i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question but i don't understand why mine has a partial response "
5776,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah and i had the same answer as student i mean not on purpose but i did "
5778,410.2,Farrah,,,"yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
5780,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh no no it's dry it says dry "
5782,410.2,Farrah,,,"the water they found yeah yeah because in the next sentence it says the water they found is microscopic so they did find some water "
5784,410.2,Farrah,,,"it says that it's really dry "
5786,410.2,Farrah,,,"they said that you need a tool well this was my answer "
5788,410.2,Farrah,,,"where the water is "
5790,410.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5792,410.2,Chris,,,"oh no "
5794,410.2,Chris,,,"in the polar craters that was my answer yeah "
5797,410.2,Chris,,,"ok "
5801,410.2,Chris,,,"the lunar orbiter "
5808,410.2,Jazmin,,,"oh ok i got it oh yeah ok so they used the lunar orbiter but then i mean i kind of said that in my answer i said that they sent a small machine No. Oh, OK. "
5810,410.2,Luis,,,"well no i guess it's not in the text that they used it "
5812,420.2,Luis,,"so we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers ","miss teacher i just heard the bell so it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate how you kept asking us to go look back at the text over and over again "
5814,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah well ok thank you bye "
5818,420.2,Luis,,,"morning um yeah so i have a question because like i know all about space already so i don't think i should really be in this class "
5820,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay i can stick around for that "
5823,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so yeah let's see the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
5827,420.1,Farrah,,"let's think about keywords in the question think about that on your own and then we will discuss what keywords we see ","um yeah okay so basically when i was looking at the question some keywords that i was seeing was like equipment that's what i saw that i thought was most important "
5829,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i agree with student i also saw equipment and i thought like water too was maybe an important word "
5832,420.1,Farrah,,,"i actually have a question i still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong "
5835,420.1,Luis,,,"Um, yeah. So what I saw was, I was looking at what look like they said like scientific tool. hey said, small machine. And I said those were equipment words. "
5837,420.1,Jazmin,,,"let's see nasa sent a small machine called the lunar obriter to investigate "
5841,420.1,Chris,,,"well i was thinking like about you know like the experience that i've had at nasa and stuff and i was thinking that like they must have sent like oxygen tanks and masks and suits with them "
5844,420.1,Jazmin,,,"he sent the small machine the lunar orbiter "
5847,420.1,Farrah,,,"i said that basically as i said that you need a small a tool called a microscope "
5850,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh um i guess not "
5852,420.1,Farrah,,,"on they sent the small machine the lunar orbiter "
5855,310.1,Farrah,,"right okay so i can see how you may have a misunderstanding there because it's the say that you would need a tool called a microscope right student ","yeah i can see that "
5857,310.1,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us "
5863,310.1,All,,,"yeah i'm good good awesome i'm good too "
5865,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm good too "
5868,310.1,Jazmin,,,"my name is student "
5870,310.1,Chris,,,"i'm student "
5872,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm student "
5874,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm student "
5876,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah and i'm student i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class i already know everything about science "
5878,310.1,Luis,,,"ok "
5880,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah ok i'll do that "
5882,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sure i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
5884,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah it's on our tablet on our desks "
5886,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh i'll read can i read "
5888,310.1,Farrah,,,"ok scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth "
5891,310.1,Farrah,,,"let me see ok i see mine says that scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere oh i see i see ok that's like the fourth sentence in here scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
5895,310.1,Farrah,,,"no no it was in paragraph 3 paragraph 3 "
5898,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i can read paragraph 2 ok yeah this is where my answer is from ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one top of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
5900,310.1,Jazmin,,,"you want me to stop reading or keep reading "
5902,310.1,Luis,,,"yes "
5904,310.1,Luis,,,"i was just going to say that i know all about the ice deposits because that's like because it's really cold there "
5907,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i was going to say that i don't know why my answer is wrong "
5910,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i'd like to read it but also i wanted to say that i went to nasa and so i know that i use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff "
5912,310.1,Chris,,,"the john f kennedy center "
5914,310.1,Chris,,,"the space center in florida with my dad i went with my dad "
5916,310.1,Chris,,,"it was a lot of fun we got to see a lot of space shuttles and astronaut space chutes and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space "
5920,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah you're welcome i can read it ok "
5922,310.1,Chris,,,"that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight eye you need a scientific microscope to look really closely "
5924,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i'm sorry to interrupt i know this was really really short and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us and i mean i didn't say anything but you really listen to class sharing their ideas and that was really nice thank you "
5928,310.1,All,,,"i'm hi i hi "
5930,310.1,Luis,,,"trust me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5932,310.1,Luis,,,"all "
5939,310.1,Oliver,,,"says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk but we can meet them um my answer was that nasa send to small machine and i said i'm scientists from craters full of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely up same thing i student "
5942,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah um i circled the last sentence it's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three "
5944,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah "
5948,310.1,Farrah,,,"we can see it on our tablets "
5961,310.1,Jazmin,,"Really small small you can look really closely at it right and see it because it's very small and the moon, but there was another machine that they kind of found the water with but i like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and i really like how you found that ","miss jennifer yes it's student um i had i wrote about my answer has about a small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5964,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah um so this is student student can i my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
5971,310.1,Jazmin,,,"that was the sound in the text and the text messages machine called a lunar orbiter oh "
5976,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm okay i'm okay to investigate i'm good investigate "
5990,410.2,Jazmin,,"it lets your teacher and it lets people know like you fewer because if you just put lunar orbiter we're not going to know what question you are answering ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest ticking i'm water "
5998,420.2,Chris,,"We need to restate that question in our answers. Well, and he's the text, so I can use the text, but can you can fit it into this question, maybe just a little more more clear into the question. ","but i do like how you did that teacher it's me student i was thinking about the equipment because you talked about equipment in the question and i wouldn't have nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6006,420.2,Chris,,"when you restate the question you kind of take some some some words from the question and put it in your answer ","okay "
6008,420.2,Chris,,,"orbiter "
6012,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah "
6017,420.2,Farrah,,"because if we just put down lunar orbiter they're not going to know what we're talking about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter it gives our reader more information and they can if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about it doesn't it ","yeah yeah yeah good yeah "
6020,420.2,Oliver,,,"teacher yes it's it's me i'm sorry but it's time for them "
6024,420.2,,,,"yeah it was lots of fun "
6030,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
6032,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay i can do that "
6042,420.2,,,,"because they said in the end of the story making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that's like i that's going to take a long time "
6048,310.1,Jazmin,,"yeah yeah you're right good and i love how you used the text to to back up your answer that's awesome i really like how i mean you went straight to the text ","i'm still kind of confused "
6051,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i think i i think i answered the question this time and i added more detail to my answer "
6061,430.2,Chris,,"Make sure you back things up, it takes like Farrah Farrah, you know, like in your answer. You didn't really back it up. ","yeah yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt i was just gonna say that's what i said in my answer "
6068,430.2,Luis,,,"wow i mean you that that's okay so i saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important "
6073,420.3,Oliver,,"So let's look back at our tix and say, there's a couple of things. Let's see if you guys can reread and find what What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together. And he says, ","i read i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
6079,420.3,Luis,,,"I'm okay. Yeah. So I read I read that sentence after after the one that i said and it says that astronauts could breathe oxygen so i mean it seems like that's pretty crucial "
6086,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh it says oxygen and it could also be used as rocket fuel Um, so that you can like go up to the moon. out like you're on the moon oh "
6088,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah they use it to go home "
6095,420.3,Oliver,,,"reach every reader it's me student "
6102,420.3,Oliver,,,"i was just looking it's me student i was looking at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch well yeah i did want to say that i appreciate for how you explained what i needed to work on me and student that we should add more details to our answer and then i did listen to when you you told student and student that they were on the right track or their answers and so i feel like you really made us feel valued and kind of helped give give me some suggestions for what to do next time "
6104,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah thanks so much i'll see you again next time "
6109,420.3,Luis,,,"high up excuse me don't i shouldn't be unless i have already know all about space "
6112,420.3,Luis,,,"because i know that i'm to go to the mon astronauts have to use oxygen tanks because they can't breathe on the moon without it "
6119,420.3,Chris,,"student i want you to look through the text and find equipment that helps them find water okay ","um yeah well cuz the question asked about water on what you were saying student and i i saw in the first paragraph that they said that they found water deep in the craters so um yeah so that's why "
6125,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well because i was looking for the name of up the equipment um and so i i only saw two things in the arm the story but machine i know his equipment and then they say a microscope at the end but i know that that one wasn't like to discover the water they were they were saying you could use it but they didn't say you they did use it so that's how i figured that the one in paragraph two was the right one "
6127,310.1,Jazmin,,"Good. You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there. ","i don't "
6129,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answers wrong "
6131,310.1,Jazmin,,,"all "
6134,310.1,Jazmin,,,"because that's what they used to look for water "
6138,420.3,Oliver,,"So you keep you look down and you read about the ","uh huh "
6143,420.3,Luis,,,"okay um so yeah um there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here um so in paragraph two they talk about the lunar orbiter and then paragraph three they talk about the microscope so that's equipment to but um and they both talked about water though in both of the paragraphs "
6152,310.1,Luis,,"good you found the equipment they talked about really really good ","it says to discover what what equipment data scientists use to discover the water Okay let me see. "
6155,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh it wasn't a question it's just that i found the rest of the sentence it says they be such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate i'm vulnerable at them and south pole and look at it so yeah "
6160,310.1,Chris,,,"ok ok i'll miss miss haley i know that um but i went to nasa so i know that that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks answer to "
6163,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah "
6170,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i found the same thing not even was saying but they have also have a small machine called the lunar orbiter um but i thought one is talking about i spend only in paragraph one paragraph three or they're really talking about the water Like frozen water. Oh. frozen Oh yeah, yeah, I got so "
6174,310.1,Farrah,,,"um okay yes so so i looked i looked because i was also i was listening to what you are seeing a student and to death to and um so i guess the answer is that um it was a lunar orbiter because they were they were looking you use a microscope to look at the water but you said what they were looking for i guess um but i guess i mean i know that because i heard you were telling it to like to student and and then "
6179,420.3,Luis,,"did you find that in the text i want you to find where it tells me what the lunar orbiter does so circle a word that tells you what the lunar orbiter does ","uh huh yeah yeah i got it now i am yeah i got it "
6182,420.3,Oliver,,,"me my family i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did want to say thank you so much for talking to each one of us about our kind of what we didn't understand and and then trying to help us get it better "
6184,420.3,All,,,"okay bye "
6192,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm i'm looking for the question i just wanted to remind you that my dad to actually an astronaut "
6194,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
6197,420.3,Farrah,,,"because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable or not "
6199,410.1,Farrah,,"but is the question asking is it right now. ","let me look at it "
6203,410.1,Luis,,,"um because i found it in the story and i know you told me last time that i have to look into it look in the text for my answers and not just because i know it already and so it comes right after the first sentence that says water could be useful so i figured that's probably where you get the answer is after the first sentence "
6208,310.1,Luis,,"good i'm glad that you're looking into the text instead of just going off of what you know ","is this convincing "
6213,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well i was thinking about the water on the moon and well it could be valuable for us to have like a moon card you know so we could grow things on the moon "
6220,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well they were talking about it i'm paragraph one but um oh i don't remember "
6224,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i see it okay it says future astronaut oh "
6228,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well it's a future astronauts could drink this water so then i was thinking okay like we need water to drink in order to live so um so yeah that's why i said "
6231,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um that future astronauts could drink the water "
6233,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah yeah it'd be good so that they could drink it oh yeah yeah that sounds good "
6237,310.1,Chris,,,"well all because that was in the in the first the first part and the the teacher our english teacher said that usually the first paragraph is where you're going to find the important information "
6244,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well because at the end it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so i mean they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon "
6250,410.1,Farrah,,"but i really want to reiterate how important the question is and really reading it it's asking you if you have enough evidence to say that it would be valuable not that they're ready ","valuable means like something that's really important like um um yeah something that's important "
6253,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i mean like like student said out people need to be able to drink water um so yeah that's valuable "
6256,410.1,Chris,,,"your research be heavy on the spaceship the space shuttle "
6259,410.1,Farrah,,,"um he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship "
6261,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah yeah that'd be great because you know if i have to carry water might my arms and be tired "
6263,410.1,Oliver,,,"was harrowing "
6266,410.1,Oliver,,,"it's time for us to go to lunch but i understand now because you kept telling us to look up a word in the question so i do appreciate that you kept on challenging and it helped me kind of think about maybe how i got to look up a question a little bit more maybe next time "
6271,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah me too hi no i was just saying hi "
6273,410.1,Luis,,,"i actually i do have a question um i don't think i should be on this class i already know all about space "
6277,410.1,Luis,,,"okay because there isn't any gravity i mean there isn't gravity in space but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide so the site so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space so they have they have a whole a whole space suit and then in their space suit they have like a helmet and then breathe out carbon dioxide can go out and then oxygen can come in so that they don't like suffocate in space "
6280,410.1,Luis,,,"um i'll me let me look down um water on the moon yeah water on the moon "
6286,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm not sure "
6288,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the small machine is called a lunar orbiter "
6290,410.1,Jazmin,,,"um investigate "
6296,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay this will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater i still don't understand why my answers wrong Oh, oh, okay. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. well it's going to land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
6298,410.1,Jazmin,,,"on the moon "
6300,410.1,Jazmin,,,"it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
6307,410.1,Chris,,,"um oh okay i'm not really sure like exactly like the amount like how many gallons or anything but i mean i got it from from the story that they found like a lot of water "
6310,410.1,Chris,,,"rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself oh yeah because it says a water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so it's like you know like deep "
6315,410.1,Chris,,,"i guess i guess not if it's just evident to not the water um but you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how student was saying but also masks and suits too Number three? "
6317,410.1,Chris,,,"let me see number three "
6319,410.1,Chris,,,"that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6321,410.1,Farrah,,,"that was my answer "
6324,410.1,Oliver,,,"well that was my answer too um student "
6326,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water and so and a microscope is basically a scientific tool but the scientific tools also equipment "
6331,410.1,Oliver,,,"it helps you look at stuff Oh, oh, I'm sorry, teacher, I just heard the bell. That means that it's time it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you took time with with class to kind of ask questions and listen to everybody's ideas um wasn't really cool class "
6333,410.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
6336,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just wanted to say like i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class "
6339,410.1,Luis,,,"okay sounds good "
6343,410.1,Farrah,,,"okay so when i looked at was i was thinking okay so what equipment did they use to discover the water right so what i saw was like microscope i thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic "
6346,310.1,Farrah,,"mm hmm they do say that and that's great text evidence to use they say this specifically in the text ","like other than other than equipment like discover "
6353,310.1,Farrah,,,"um i guess i still understand why my answer is wrong because they it sounds like they had to use the microscope to see it so how could they discover if they didn't see it Oh, so they have to find the first "
6357,310.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah i think you answered my question thank you "
6362,310.1,Jazmin,,,"they sent this small machine so it's this small machine "
6364,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes it's the lunar orbiter "
6371,520.1,Oliver,,"so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question ","well i guess i'm not sure i guess think about it Um, well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment. Right. And like look at what was using to discover the thing "
6375,510.1,Luis,,"we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywords ","um yeah i guess i was gonna say kind of the same thing like we look for the keywords right but i guess i'm not totally sure like what are the keywords "
6377,510.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah so i guess what i found is that the keywords were equipment and like you had to also look at discover and see like that those were the important words we eventually had to find "
6379,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i guess you know how do you find them "
6382,510.1,Chris,,,"oh i'm kind of had a different idea i was just thinking like you i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits so like why wasn't that maybe an answer "
6386,410.2,Chris,,"well that wasn't an answer because in our text it didn't talk about that ","oh so it's just stuff that we read not stuff that we knew Oh, that makes sense. "
6388,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for being with us "
6391,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's the thing i don't really think i need to be in this class because i know all about space already so i don't really need any help with this stuff "
6393,410.2,Luis,,,"okay that sounds good "
6399,410.2,Farrah,,,"um so i would say that um i think it's the third paragraph in the third paragraph they say that on the water they found this microscopic and you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6402,410.2,Farrah,,,"um well okay so i i'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong because i think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what i mean tey had to look at the water to see it "
6405,410.2,Farrah,,,"Yeah, I think that sort of makes sense. I feel like, well, so how did they, how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it. "
6410,410.2,Farrah,,,"um well let's see uh no i don't think there's anything about a machine "
6413,410.2,Jazmin,,,"so what i saw that nasa used small machine and so i think that's something that they said that they were using to find like to discover the water you know what i mean like that was something that they looked at "
6418,410.2,Jazmin,,,"Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter. Like it means to like find something or like, yeah, like to find something or to see something or to study something "
6424,410.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so i kind of got like i was sort of thinking um like i was wondering um well i feel like i like did they use like spacesuits and stuff so i feel like that might be missing from the from the the reading or something like because they have to use like spacesuits to go out and space "
6427,410.2,Chris,,,"oh so like so like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it is that right "
6432,410.2,Jazmin,,,"so we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for taking the time to work with us today and especially like i really wanted to thank you for being so patient with us and our answers and like um like you really made us feel valued like when we were talking and had different ideas like you made sure that we knew that like our ideas were still worth listening to and that's really special so thank you so much for that "
6435,410.2,Oliver,,,"hi "
6437,410.2,Oliver,,,"oh we're good we're really excited to work with you "
6439,410.2,Luis,,,"i don't think i should be in this class like i already know all about space like all this stuff and i don't think i really have any problems like figuring it out "
6441,410.2,Luis,,,"okay "
6444,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so i said that a scientist would need to use a microscope "
6447,410.2,Farrah,,,"yeah um so when i was looking at like when i was looking at the beginning i was thinking like what equipment the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as like i know what i use microscopes in class so i know that you have to use them and it says microscopic in the reading it says that things are really small so you'd have to use a microscope "
6450,310.1,Oliver,,"very good i love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good ","um yeah so i have the same answer i student so i thought it was the microscope and i guess for me i guess it was kind of the same thing i figured when i read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that i saw like when i was reading so i guess that could be the only answer "
6452,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm not really sure like i feel like i guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and i know that like we're we're working on the small class so we can we can kind of get the right answer but i'm not really sure why my answer is wrong "
6456,310.1,Chris,,,"so i was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water "
6459,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess because when i looked at the text what i was thinking was basically like i was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters and so i thought like well that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water i was like well there's the water "
6462,310.1,Jazmin,,,"basically nasa sent this small machine and that was what was like what found all the water "
6466,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i guess i mostly was thinking like about what i already do so i guess i didn't read it that closely because i was like i already know this like they use like space suits and gloves and i've been to nasa so i know that they use like oxygen tanks masks and suits like to go to space "
6472,310.1,Oliver,,,"Unfortunately, we have to go on to the next group, but thank you. "
6475,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
6480,310.1,Luis,,,"no i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut "
6482,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
6487,310.1,Farrah,,,"um i guess i was looking really close but i guess i still kind of see that it's a microscope because that was what i saw "
6490,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i guess i saw the same thing cuz i i just kept seeing microscope and i kept thinking about microscopes for some reason "
6495,310.1,Chris,,,"well okay so i tried to focus on the equipment and so instead of i realized my my answer was like about like the water so i i was looking at was like okay so like what equipment and i couldn't decide i thought maybe it was the microscope or maybe it was the lunar orbiter i didn't know "
6498,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess i still think my answer is right that nasa used a small machine to get to the water "
6501,310.1,Luis,,,"i did i did read it i did read it i just i just kept thinking about all those like spacesuits and all that you know "
6509,310.1,Chris,,,"i i am we go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for really thoughtfully work with us because you help me to understand like how my thinking led to you know to the first answer and why it wasn't quite the right answer and you you made me feel really value and i think class felt really valued and felt like you know what i mean like that you appreciated what we were saying so i just wanted to thank you because it was really nice to have that so thank you so much "
6513,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you we're excited to work with you "
6516,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's here's the thing like i don't think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and i know all this stuff and like i don't think i really need any help with this stuff "
6518,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
6521,310.1,Farrah,,,"we can read super fast so we're done "
6528,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i think um i think the answer is the microscope they said that in in paragraph three you need a micro a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6530,310.1,Farrah,,,"well that was i'm sorry this was student that was my answer from the beginning "
6533,310.1,Farrah,,,"but i think it was still that's okay um so i still think it's the microscope and i'm not sure like why my answer might be incorrect i don't really know "
6537,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah we've used it in science class before "
6539,310.1,Oliver,,,"um we were looking at dna like we did a like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like dna cells it was really interesting "
6545,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think that they would use i think that the answer is that they're using the small machine and the small machine is what they're using to discover the water i'm not sure if the microscope is what they're discovering with so i'm not quite sure if farrah's right or if i'm right "
6552,310.1,Chris,,,"no no i don't need help but i did have a question "
6555,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so i was thinking that um i went to nasa with my dad and we studied like all of these like different things that like um like the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like i was wondering like like that was my answer well i mean know my answer was about the craters but like i think that like maybe we could use the oxy like they could use oxygen tanks to find it also "
6557,310.1,Chris,,,"um i guess it doesn't really say anything about like i'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff i guess that was like from like my understanding "
6561,310.1,Oliver,,,"um sure okay so scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth however they used to believe that there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
6567,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigat the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crator these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
6571,310.1,Luis,,,"okay okay so okay so yeah like um okay this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic many wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6574,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes scientific tool in the third paragraph with the microscope "
6578,310.1,Jazmin,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today like you were very patient with us as we were all giving our answers and we all had very different answers and you were really thoughtful about like listening to us and helping us be able to say our answers about what we thought like sometimes we stress out our science teacher and you were so patient and it really made us feel confident to like share answers so thank you so much "
6580,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
6582,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you "
6585,310.1,Luis,,,"um so i just wanted to say um i already kind of know like all about space and like i kind of like know like all this stuff so i don't think i need to be in this class "
6587,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah that's that's a good point "
6590,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes we did we all yeah "
6594,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so basically um i think that the answer is they used the microscope because they that's the science tool they talk about in paragraph three "
6597,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and so basically um for me like i thought that they used to small machine to discover the water "
6601,420.2,Farrah,,"so whenever we're looking at passages we really want to focus on textual evidence now textual evidence is when you have a question and you refer back to your passage to find the exact answer or as close as possible ","no i guess not "
6605,420.2,Farrah,,,"yes that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon Okay, so here's my question. I'm, I'm trying to understand, like, why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water "
6610,420.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so i was just wondering like my dad took me to nasa and we went and studied like and looked at all like the stuff that people wear there and like the spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all this stuff like don't we need that stuff to find the water like i think that maybe we need that stuff too "
6619,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we could lunch i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you for working with us today you are so patient and so positive with all of us it really makes us feel like we can share our ideas with you like because you were so like helpful with like the different answers that we had and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and he says we give him stress hives and you were so just like calm and and just very thoughtful so i just wanted to thank you so much for that "
6622,420.2,Luis,,,"okay excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
6636,420.2,Chris,,,"So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water "
6639,420.2,Jazmin,,,"my answer came from paragraph two i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
6643,420.2,Jazmin,,,"Called the lunar orbit Jupiter. "
6645,420.2,Jazmin,,,"and the lunar orbiter "
6648,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i just have to add called lunar orbiter "
6650,420.2,Chris,,,"i didn't see it in the story i'm in the story but i just heard you tell i'm student what it was so no i know that it was the lunar orbiter "
6652,420.2,Chris,,,"better okay okay teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6655,420.2,Chris,,,"Yeah yeah "
6661,420.2,Farrah,,,"the question was asking about equipment and so i was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope i know his equipment and also i was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph they talk about the microscope as a scientific tool to look at the water "
6663,420.2,Farrah,,,"used it to look at the water "
6665,420.2,Farrah,,,"i guess no i guess not "
6667,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i guess i guess so i feel like oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at "
6669,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you again later "
6671,420.2,Oliver,,,"alright "
6674,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so now i'm all good "
6679,420.2,Luis,,,"Okay. um i'm going to say water is a big important word "
6689,420.3,Farrah,,"now let's look at some supporting details that prove why it's a valuable resource ","but i'm still kind of confused "
6694,420.2,Chris,,"You always want to prove your answer so that you always know that it's right. ","well i said that thing about them not being able to drink it so i think i'm right too yeah so that's why i put that one as my answer so i think i'm right "
6699,420.2,Luis,,,"that's the thing i said i said that one "
6702,420.2,Luis,,,"i mean yeah cuz you know class needs to breathe that's that's that's like the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing "
6706,420.2,Chris,,,"i read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024 "
6710,420.2,Chris,,,"reacher every reader well i mean that's why i'm still confused because i did you something from the text but you told me it was wrong yeah it looks like you know me and student and student add some stuff from the text i don't know where class were talking about student and student "
6715,420.2,Luis,,"So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response. ","Okay, so I guess what you're saying is that, me and Farrah were right too. So there you go. Chris, hmm. Um, but we just have to add more words. So all I have to say no it's not ready. Um, they would need to study the multiverse and build new equipment okay so i added more details is that as a good answers i got enough "
6720,420.2,Oliver,,"So when I talked about how you could break it down into hydrogen and oxygen that talked about a way that makes your water valuable. So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible. Does that help better explain it to you Oliver. ","okay um yeah okay thanks i just i guess you're saying i'm not like i'm but i i used i added more stuff from the text and my answer but i didn't answer the question "
6722,420.2,Oliver,,"correct you got to make sure that you answer the question and when you answer your question you got to make sure you add all of your details ","okay "
6727,510.1,Oliver,,"but what we need to do is definitely go through your passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight your headings or your sub headings because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer ","all thanks teacher it looks like a time for us to go to lunch but i do appreciate how you you asked me a lot of questions to help me think about well how i i came to my answer and and and how you explain what what i need to work on which is like looking highlighting some of the arm but the headings and more details throughout the whole story i think to find more evidence to match the question "
6729,510.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
6733,510.1,Luis,,,"hi i'm excuse me master clement "
6735,510.1,Luis,,,"be on this class i already know all about space "
6743,510.1,Luis,,,"well well like you said you know i know a lot about space and i know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon so they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon "
6751,510.1,Luis,,,"um okay well i don't know i don't know that one "
6756,510.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay. i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
6768,420.2,Chris,,"but your answer sort of just summed up the fact that they sent a small machine and what you should be looking for is maybe an answer that. so you should be looking for something more specific what the small machine was called would be a more solid answer than just the small machine so when you're reading and it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon you should name that machine In the correct response like just just if you were having a conversation with someone and like as if you are super excited about the moon and they asked you what kind of machine do they use discover water on them and then your answer should be more specific to to answer them if you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it so that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks ","yeah yeah i i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6770,420.2,Chris,,,"me and my dad went "
6790,510.1,Oliver,,"And the text. The informative text does list some of the machines, it says the names of the machines. And right before they talk about the discovery of, okay, so that would be a more solid answer. and it answers the question better okay okay so you're when you're reading the informative text you should be looking for words that jump out to you about the question being asked maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question ","i'm sorry mr clemens i know it's been a short time but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class "
6793,510.1,Oliver,,,"ok so we'll see you later "
6796,510.1,Farrah,,,"how are you we're excited to work with you today "
6799,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah you can just pretend like we're real students in the classroom and you can call on us or have us work however you like "
6802,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so i actually like i know all about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class because i don't really need the help "
6804,510.1,Luis,,,"um well i didn't really get it from the text a kind of just knew it so i didn't really like get it from the reading "
6811,510.1,Luis,,,"Okay, that, that makes sense. um like, we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text. um discover discover the water "
6816,510.1,Farrah,,,"well i can i yeah i can look it up and try to see um i gotta kind of read it through i didn't read it very carefully i have a question it's student "
6818,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i was wondering um i said that the the the the tool used the equipment used to discover the water was a microscope but i'm trying to understand what my answer might be incorrect "
6822,410.2,Farrah,,"so you found a sentence from the paragraph that had a piece of equipment in it but your answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it doesn't answer the question exactly about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","Oh, OK. OK. "
6825,430.2,Oliver,,"you you just said i circled the same as student but you should voice your own answer not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates so that i can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment but you're you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did so you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","ah ok i can do that "
6831,420.3,Chris,,"but they didn't say full of water you didn't really read and do your underlining and highlighting you should be looking for keywords like tool equipment or maybe machine to help you find what they used to discover the water ","yeah i think i think you're right on i didn't well because i was thinking like i was thinking about well okay this is a little bit of a different thing but it makes me wonder if like like like we're kind of like a like we we like have to use spacesuits like if we go up in in space like i went to nasa and like saw the exhibit and stuff so i guess i'm wondering like did they not have to use that equipment to discover the water "
6838,430.2,Jazmin,,"But there's, it's more descriptive. They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine. So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. And you're right, it is a small machine. But what was the machine called and what did it do? ","it was the in the same sentence as this machine it says the lunar orbiter to investigate "
6841,430.2,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter it lands at the south pole and it looks for ice deposits okay yes so so it does say pretty clearly like that's the thing that that found the water right "
6846,430.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah kind of we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us because sometimes we can get really kind of wrapped up and confused about the answer but you were really clear in what you are saying and asking us to look at specific parts of the reading and also um you were very positive with us so we felt like we could still give an answer even if it wasn't correct so i just wanted to thank you "
6849,430.2,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i am already know all about space "
6852,430.2,Luis,,,"all okay "
6857,420.1,Oliver,,"okay so i want you to look at your paper and i want you to circle the keywords in this question so circle maybe two keywords from this question i'll give you about 10 seconds to do that ","Oh, whoops you said two, I circled like four "
6860,420.1,Jazmin,,,"I said, and discover "
6864,420.1,Farrah,,,"i did yeah and moon to "
6873,420.1,,,"i'll give you 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words so what's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover ","i said that equipment is a tool but i don't understand my my answer is wrong "
6889,420.1,Luis,,,"so um when i read it i read the thing where it talked about the microscope because i thought microscope was a tool just like student um yeah and i saw that an arm and in paragraph four they talked about a spacecraft um so that's an appointment true um so that's what i saw and most true well okay so i saw that they talked about a microscope in paragraph three with the water and i didn't really i saw a machine i guess the spacecraft yeah yeah spacecraft machine um yeah and microscope is is it my turn okay i think we're done "
6892,420.1,Chris,,,"i want to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to "
6903,420.1,Farrah,,,"well me and depth kind of set the same stuff we said that you know the microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to "
6906,420.1,Oliver,,,"hey oh are you know teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch "
6911,420.1,Luis,,,"well i i wanted i'm sorry i just wanted to say i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
6913,420.1,Luis,,,"okay okay so what i i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
6916,420.1,Luis,,,"oh um i didn't actually circle anything because i already know a bunch of stuff about equipment that they use "
6921,410.2,Luis,,"so although it's really great that you have a lot of background knowledge we have to look at the the paragraph to answer our question ","okay "
6925,410.2,Jazmin,,,"circle that at the beginning of paragraph to "
6929,410.2,Jazmin,,,"excuse me i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
6933,420.2,Jazmin,,"You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here. ","okay "
6942,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i i found it on my own but since you had asked student first i was just trying to say that i had the same answer but i didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it "
6951,420.1,Chris,,"we are close but i think we might need to look at the question a little bit and maybe rephrase it sometimes i feel like it's helpful to put a question in our own words to understand what it's really asking what i want you to do is i want you to circle the two action words in this question the two main action words or verbs in this question or verbs in this question so i'll give you about ","i circled us and discover and that made me think about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits "
6961,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i still think that the small machine is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things you know and they investigate so i still think it's in paragraph two "
6964,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i was a lunar orbitre "
6970,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sorry to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch i i wanted to say thank you for helping us understand some of the important words in the question and to try to see if i can help us find that in the text and i like how you valued class like i felt like you understood at least that i we all kind of we're trying to find the answer and that felt good "
6972,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's my question um so i know like all about space like i know all this stuff about space like i don't really think i need any help so i'm not really sure like why am i in this class "
6974,420.1,,,,"so in the texts in front of you called the moon is a desert "
6977,410.1,Luis,,"but we didn't exactly answer the question about equipment what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well i guess like i was wondering like do they use like oxygen tanks and do they use like that kind of stuff because like like that like seems like something they'd have to use but maybe they don't "
6979,410.1,Luis,,,"i didn't really read very closely "
6983,410.1,Luis,,,"oh um yeah i didn't really read too closely i should probably look at it "
6986,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well i guess it's more of like kind of a comment i already know like all about space so i think i even need to be in this "
6990,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah ok so my answer was basically you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really close "
6994,310.1,Farrah,,"okay and i like that you use that wording scientific tool ","okay so i looked at the keywords in the question and i thought the keyword for equipment and discuss and when i looked at the reading what i saw was that the microscope was something they said that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it without a microscope so i was like well then you have to use the microscope you know what i mean "
7000,310.1,Oliver,,"i like that you use that word scientific tool great great job there ","um yeah so i would say i guess it was sort of similar but basically what i would say like in my own words is that like you use the microscope to see the water and like kind of what she said that it's microscopic so i was thinking that like how could you find the water or the i guess the ice that's like the frozen water how could you find it if you can't see it you know "
7003,420.2,Jazmin,,"i do understand what you mean and i really appreciate you explaining your answer so next time when we are asked a question instead of saying i answered it like student or a neighbor make sure you write an answer out instead of saying i found the same thing as my friend i want to hear what you found ","well i guess my question is that it still don't quite understand why my answer is wrong and i just was trying to figure it out "
7007,420.2,Jazmin,,,"a small machine "
7011,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so yeah so well okay so when i was reading i saw that oh okay so yeah i just looked at it again so are you seeing like i should say what the machine is "
7014,420.2,Chris,,"well it's always good to add detail to our answers and so the more detail we can provide with our answer the better or the stronger answer can be ","i went to nasa with my dad and when we were there we saw that scientists use masks and suits and oxygen tanks i was wondering i'm like it's not in the reading like did they use those to find the water "
7017,420.2,Chris,,,"Yeah, that does so like I need to use the evidence not like background knowledge. "
7020,420.2,Chris,,,"Yeah okay that actually. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. So like it's. Yes. That makes sense. "
7022,420.2,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to the next class which were bummed about because we're having a lot of fun working with you but um thank you so much for working with us "
7025,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah well it's kind of more of like a thought i guess i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good "
7030,430.2,Luis,,"however if we were talking just about our reading passage those are not necessarily in there so can you come up with a new way to discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable can you think about that and i'll come back to you ","yeah absolutely "
7034,430.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so basically okay and let's see it's in the second reading the water is a valuable resource and i said in paragraph four it could be useful in lots of ways the astronauts could drink this water "
7037,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah all living things need water "
7041,430.2,Chris,,,"so i was thinking when i was looking at it that well okay so i was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship but maybe you could could get the water on the moon you wouldn't have to take as much water with you although i have to say i'm still a little confused about kind of like you and i mean like how it didn't quite answer the question "
7045,430.2,Chris,,,"Yeah, I think it does. Yes, thank you. "
7047,430.2,Luis,,,"um i forgot "
7053,430.2,Oliver,,,"um so i guess it's kind of it's kind of interesting so i when i mean it's not ready yet like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet so um it's kind of like it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence and i thought it wasn't as convincing because it seemed like it would take a long time to work and even though i read that we're going to try to have a moon base on the moon by like 2024 or around then i kind of don't think that's gonna happen because they always say that you're going to like put stuff in space or we're going to go to mars but then it never happened and so i was thinking that like even though it might be valuable like maybe i don't think it would be for a long time "
7065,310.1,Farrah,,"I agree with you. I think that you are correct, that sometimes it's not going to be ready. Like right now, it's not ready and I do like that you shared your opinion, good job there. ","yeah absolutely so i i wish i could unfortunately because you have to go but before we go over i really wanted to thank you for working with us and i in particular there were so many cool things that you were doing with us we were working together like first off you have to make sure that we were using evidence from the text whenever we gave an answer which was really cool and you asked us like all the time you asked like all of us like what what our thinking was like to the answers we have and i like class had really thought processes that they were able to share and you let us have time to explain like what her ideas for and that really made us feel valued and you you said that really thoughtful things to us that i think we're really true and like i think meant something to class right class yeah i think that like it was really cool working with you because i think we learned a lot about how to respond like more effectively questions like this so thank you so much thank you "
7067,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
7069,310.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing well thank you "
7071,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's kind of a question like um so i know all about space like all this stuff and i don't really think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help "
7074,310.1,Luis,,,"okay that sounds good "
7078,310.1,Oliver,,,"well we came to the same answer basically because she she was right i think i circled the same answer so like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i agree with student "
7083,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh that's a that's a fair question um but i found it on my own we are we're kind of both looking separately OK, I can do that. "
7086,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i have a question um i was wondering if um like so my answer like if we're all in the class to work together on getting the more correct answer like i was wondering why my answer might be incorrect "
7088,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah this is student "
7090,310.1,Farrah,,,"no problem "
7094,420.2,Farrah,,"how do you think that we could have wrote our answer differently to include the question ","yeah definitely i think i know what you mean yeah "
7097,420.2,Farrah,,,"we're looking for water "
7099,420.2,Farrah,,,"in paragraph three it says um you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7103,420.2,Farrah,,"not that your answer is incorrect because i see in the third paragraph that it states exactly what you said but maybe adding exactly what they're looking for can also help your other friends maybe if you're working in partners of two ","yeah thank you "
7107,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so basically i was just gonna ask the question like so when i looked at it i thought okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i guess i guess i should have said lunar orbiter and i guess i'm wondering like is it the microscope or is it the lunar orbiter that found the stuff "
7111,420.2,Chris,,,"no i do i do remember um i thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters um but i did have a quick question "
7113,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah of course "
7115,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think so "
7119,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i think it means something really small "
7128,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok i should probably let have i should probably let student have this turn and yeah we just because unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you before we had to leave sometimes our science teacher he says that we give him stress hives and you are so thoughtful and friendly in the way that you're asking us our questions and i think that i can speak for class and say that like i don't think class felt like um felt bad like if they had the wrong answer which is really important like sometimes we all feel really bad if we if we don't have the right answer so i just wanted to thank you for really like paying attention to us and being so kind in in thoughtful "
7131,420.2,Farrah,,,"yes we are "
7135,420.2,Luis,,,"um so i was talking about like using like oxygen tanks and like stuff like that and um like i don't really know like if i should be in this class because i know all about space so i kind of feel like i know a lot of stuff about this "
7142,420.2,Luis,,,"I guess I didn't really like read it as closely as I could have "
7146,420.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so i kind of was um so my answer was um you would find that the scientists found like craters full of water on the moon "
7153,430.1,Chris,,"so rather than saying they found the water when you do go back into the text and see what machinery they use to find that water ","okay gotcha okay "
7155,430.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah so basically um i was just wanted i was just gonna ask like so my answer was um you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope which was in the in the reading but i'm i'm not quite sure what my answer it isn't right "
7161,430.1,Jazmin,,,"so my question is then so i said that nasa sent a small machine and did i just like why was my answer not quite right "
7165,420.2,Chris,,"So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific. ","um yeah so i was just i was just thinking about like what you need in space and i was kind of thinking about luis's answer and like so my dad and i we went to nasa so i know that like if they're astronauts up there they have to use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and all that kind of stuff so um i was just curious like did they did they not have astronauts "
7170,420.2,Chris,,,"oh okay yeah that makes sense so like you you to maybe they had to use like the equipment but it's not what they used to like find the water "
7175,420.2,Jazmin,,,"actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i also wanted to say like to thank you for being so clear like with your response to our answers like sometimes we can frustrate our teachers a little bit because we're still working out you know like the answers as we go but you were very patient and you also were very clear and helping us understand like what we were trying to say so just wanted to thank you for that because not class does that "
7178,420.2,,,,"we're excited to work with you "
7181,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to say that like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
7183,420.2,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can do that "
7192,420.1,Farrah,,"all right so what i think we should do after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question ","um i think the keywords are and discover "
7194,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah actually i agree with student i said equipment and discover as well "
7198,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i see discover a different answer than them and i'm confused why my answer is wrong "
7200,420.1,Chris,,,"um well i was just gonna say like i i only underlined "
7207,410.3,Farrah,,"a piece of equipment but in the text it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon ","oh well i guess like what i thought about the you know about the microscope is that like they couldn't okay so in a text they said that they couldn't see the are acceptable microscope because it was so small but um i thought like how could they find it if they couldn't see it "
7209,410.3,Farrah,,,"oh so they like something like studied the water "
7211,410.3,Farrah,,,"and another "
7213,410.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah that makes sense so like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope "
7219,430.2,Chris,,"the question is actually wanting to know what equipment they used to discover water on the moon in that sense your answer doesn't fully answer the question you did put that they found water which is correct but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water does that make sense ","yeah i think i think it does like i guess my question is i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess like if i know that like even if it's not in the meeting like is that the answer to "
7226,410.1,Chris,,"but for this specific question it wants to know what specifically they used to find that water and that wouldn't necessarily be like oxygen tanks and things like that however having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic but it's not specific to that question if that makes sense ","yeah i think i think that makes sense like so i'm supposed to like pull from the reading answer the question not from like what i what i knew before "
7229,420.2,Chris,,"yeah we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question student that is one thing i think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading ","gotcha "
7233,420.2,Jazmin,,,"but i can do that she was caught the lunar orbit so is that was it the lunar orbiter was with the "
7236,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i think that doesn't make sense so okay so that's the answer that's the equipment that you to find the what like to discuss "
7238,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us "
7241,420.2,All,,,"hi "
7243,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's more of a statement so i think i got this all figured out now like thanks to the first thing that we covered so i think i'm all good "
7245,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i can stick around for that "
7252,420.1,Chris,,"okay so within that question just like we talked about in our first session what do you think are some keywords in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question ","um okay so when i look at it i think that convincing evidence and valuable Um, okay. So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value. "
7258,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i think for me when i was looking at it like i kind of thought that um well i guess i wasn't totally sure i thought maybe because i thought like what you could do with the water so i kind of think water might be important i guess i'm not sure "
7261,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
7269,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i mean just we have a question oh yeah well i guess i'm sorry to jump in i just was still kind of confused about like actually we haven't really got to my ticket so i guess we can wait like "
7279,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah there's um let's see yeah and the very first sentence right there yeah like and the very first sentence of the fourth paragraph it says water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource i guess i think like we probably did the same thing like when we were talking about it i think what we were thinking was that well at least for me like i don't think that the water would be valuable yeah because i don't like i don't think that we can use it yet and so when they asked like is our convincing evidence like it it sort of made me think like it's not very convincing because we don't really know like how to use the technology exactly to wit so i kind of thought like you know what i mean like maybe it wasn't valuable yet "
7286,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i guess that's true because i read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water if i did that "
7293,420.1,Chris,,,"well they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from earth so i guess it would be by "
7303,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah well unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like there was a couple things in particular that were really cool like for example you really helped us to understand like what the question was asking for each of the questions and you really make sure that we use but that's like from the text when we were talking about our answers and like even more like you made us feel really valued and you explain like what we needed to work on like you know what i mean so that we could get a better or more complete answer and you gave us ideas for like you know what i mean what your concerns were and then like helped us to kind of find our way to to understanding it which was really cool and like that's not always the case so like thank you so much because i think like class in the class like feels like you know what i mean like we all understand it really well at this so thank you so much "
7306,420.1,Oliver,,,"we're good we'ere excited to work with you "
7308,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class "
7311,420.1,Luis,,,"i can stick around "
7316,310.1,Farrah,,"awesome okay so you class have all shared your responses with us and that's been really really good i really liked that you class tried to pull your evidence from the text ","okay so all right so my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and i was looking in paragraph three that's where i got my evidence because they talk about a microscope here "
7318,310.1,Farrah,,,"it's three three "
7325,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so actually i guess it was really about looking like discover it doesn't really say that it just says you need it to look really close "
7328,310.1,Oliver,,,"no i was gonna say the same thing as student but i'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong i don't quite understand "
7331,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so that basically like when you look at it the third paragraph like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up with what the question is asked it says you could look really closely but it does it match like the word discover "
7335,310.1,Chris,,,"student find "
7337,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i was going to say investigate "
7340,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i guess i'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment "
7342,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm not sure "
7344,310.1,Chris,,,"well yeah i was gonna say i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading but i know that they use you know "
7351,310.1,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
7356,420.2,Oliver,,"very good okay so one of the things i would say is that you class did a really good job trying to pull things you found out of the text Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah. What is it that she picked that I agree with. So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her. Does that make sense. ","oh yeah i could tell you "
7359,410.2,Farrah,,"Okay, Farrah you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery. You just picked the wrong one. Right. ","yeah i can see that unfortunately we have to go to lunch thank you so much "
7362,410.2,Luis,,,"um i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut that's pretty cool "
7367,420.3,Chris,,"so look back on your article and look for that word valuable do you see it anywhere in there maybe look for the word in one of the headings or sub headings ","oh yeah i saw it i's a subheading at the top it's water is a valuable resource "
7369,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah "
7375,420.3,Jazmin,,,"you can say it's expensive "
7379,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm like something you can use or something that you need like valuable is you know like yeah like something that that you want "
7381,420.3,Farrah,,,"i was gonna say the same stuff "
7383,420.3,Farrah,,,"mostly the same stuff "
7386,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah actually yes it "
7388,420.3,Farrah,,,"it says water on the moon valuable are very important resource "
7391,420.3,Farrah,,,"no it's okay i was just gonna say yeah very important and then in the next line it says useful "
7402,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah we had a chance to look at and have the conversation "
7406,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay so one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen and it says that in the reading you said to look at the at the beauty and it says you could do that and that i think that would you really use "
7409,430.2,Jazmin,,"why would that be useful that is an excellent point but i want you to think about why that would be useful so you've given me a really good piece of evidence but you need to validate that using the text in the next sentence so what should that next sentence say ","for example future astronauts could drink this water you can drink it and do other stuff right "
7413,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah my dad would totally need that "
7420,430.2,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class we go to our next class i just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today and in particular you like really helped us to remember to use evidence in our reading and in our in our answers like so that didn't just say stuff without using evidence and like even more like you help us understand the meaning of words also they helped us to think about like how did we get to the answer so it was really cool because we were able to explain like what we were thinking about and i feel that you are really this student student just says stuff sometimes so we thank you so much it was really fun to work with you "
7422,430.2,Farrah,,,"bye "
7424,430.2,Farrah,,,"doing good it's good to see you "
7435,430.2,Jazmin,,,"um yeah so like here's something that's kind of on my mind like i know like a lot about space and um i don't really think i need to be at this class you know Um, well, okay, so equipment and scientists and um water and moon yeah um student okay so basically and another word that i saw was discovered it's like when you find something or when you when you when you find something "
7438,430.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
7440,420.3,Jazmin,,"good so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right because investigate is something you do to discover something right ","right okay so i underlined it "
7446,420.3,Chris,,,"um so i kind of was like um let's see uh well is like in paragraph one i think no no no was it paragraph one yep scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um well i guess i'm not sure "
7448,420.3,Chris,,,"um well okay so there's a couple places on paragraph two they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
7450,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so basically student and i both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water "
7454,420.3,Oliver,,,"um um well they would use the microscope to look at it and it said that in the in the reading it said that the water they found is microscopic so it's like really small like you couldn't see it you had to look in the microscope um yeah i guess so "
7456,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh oh oh so i just this really "
7462,420.3,Farrah,,,"um well i guess i guess i'm not sure because like you have you have like the microscope but you would study it and then you have like student said the lunar orbiter and so you would use maybe both of them yeah so i was just going to ask like although i'm not sure now but it seemed like maybe the microscope wasn't the answer so i was just wondering why it was the lunar orbiter and not the microscope it's like finding something "
7468,420.2,Jazmin,,"and if you need help getting started you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what and then write out your response ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just before we went to lunch i wanted to just thank you for working with us and especially i just wanted to thank you for you were really careful about making sure that like we all had a chance to speak and sometimes that doesn't happen in the class and so it was just really nice because we all had a chance to speak and we all had a chance to share our thoughts and also you were really patient even though we weren't like totally sure like what each piece was so i just wanted to thank you for doing that "
7471,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh it was delicious we had some noodles but then we had a chocolate chip cookie for desert that was mm mm mmmm "
7474,420.2,Luis,,,"teacher yes yeah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
7479,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay well in the last paragraph it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it sounds like that they don't have the money and it'll take a long time "
7482,420.2,Farrah,,,"i mean all yeah cuz water it's definitely important so i guess if they could get to it it would be yeah "
7485,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay because well you know like we need water to drink um and i feel like i read it in my book i read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink "
7487,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah yeah yeah i see it okay it's in the beginning it says future astronauts could drink this water "
7489,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah cuz you need to drink "
7493,420.2,Chris,,,"how could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters okay so i said it was heavy oh well because okay so i know about when when the rockets take off that they they it's already heavy right because they have all this fuel and so then maybe you would burn less fuel if if it was less if they didn't have to carry as much water "
7496,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i was just thinking um you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
7501,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i had read the same thing that student was talking about in the last paragraph machine to you someone want ours to come up with a plan for extracting are getting out of the poor yeah i mean not i was like arm they need to study the moon's surface and sounds like it will be really hard because i need to study the moons surgace build new equipment i mean it's not valuable because it's too expensive "
7504,420.2,Oliver,,,"i mean yeah cuz cuz you know water is valuable yeah okay water is valuable "
7506,420.2,Chris,,,"excuse me mr teacher i just thought about something from the story "
7508,420.2,Chris,,,"water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7510,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah that's what i was gonna say that was that was the answer that i sent for the question "
7513,420.2,Luis,,,"to breathe "
7518,420.2,Luis,,,"rocket fuel "
7520,420.2,Farrah,,,"rocket fuel "
7523,420.2,Farrah,,,"i don't i don't see what you're seeing "
7525,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay yeah yeah oh i see that i see "
7530,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i was just gonna say i was looking at the clock out it's time for the next class um but i did want to say thank you so much mr teacher for helping us think about like what what we needed to find an ma ma ma ma ma story cuz i thought that you know i had read the story pretty well but then because you kept on asking us to think about it and to look at the story i i feel like i kind of maybe get it a little bit more baby "
7533,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
7536,420.2,Jazmin,,,"hi hello how are you "
7538,420.2,Jazmin,,,"we're doing well thank you "
7540,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah it's a question but it's well so here's the thing i know a lot about space so i don't think i really have to be in this class because i already know all this stuff "
7542,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah that sounds like fun yeah "
7546,420.2,Farrah,,,"um so i think that the um the equipment was the microscope like in the reading it says you need a microscope you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7548,420.2,Farrah,,,"um well it's like i think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope "
7552,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah that doesn't make sense so they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon "
7557,420.2,Chris,,,"well so here's the thing like i kind of thought that like um well i've been to nasa with my dad and like we really like we had a really good time like walking around and like we saw all these like exhibits and stuff so i guess my guess is kind of like luis's like i think that they must have used like spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that "
7560,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i was just wondering if like if the answer was what well i was just a little bit confused like why my answer might not be right "
7562,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry it cut out for just a second i'm sorry "
7564,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so basically i was saying that um i was just wondering like why my answer maybe wasn't right like because i think we were just saying that the the the machine was gonna like see everything so i'm just trying to find out like like why my answer might not be right "
7567,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things "
7569,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the moon "
7571,420.2,Jazmin,,,"orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like i guess like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon "
7579,310.1,Jazmin,,"you did a great job being able to identify what that means ","yeah i think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope but they they might find it with something else with the machine i "
7583,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm so sorry we have to go to lunch now but before we did i just wanted to thank you for working with us and specifically i wanted to thank you for being so patient sometimes we our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful and very patient and also like even though our answers were kind of muddled at first like you helped us be very clear about what we were trying to say so thank you so much "
7586,310.1,Bennett,,,"okay let's bring up the student "
7590,310.1,Luis,,,"oh excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
7593,310.1,Chris,,,"uh huh it says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
7598,310.1,Chris,,,"what equipment they used to find it i don't remember "
7601,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay let me look i don't remember that's a small machine called a lunar orbiter that's the small machine it's the lunar orbiter student "
7603,310.1,Chris,,,"oh no i mean i've been a nasa and i saw the mars rover but i don't know what a lunar orbiter is "
7605,310.1,Luis,,,"okay well so i know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use and i know that there isn't gravity but i actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before so this is news to me "
7610,310.1,Jazmin,,,"but mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
7614,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong "
7618,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah "
7622,310.1,Luis,,,"hmm okay now that i've seen a picture of it um i think that let's see how would they detect the water um i feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it and if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it "
7625,310.1,Farrah,,,"well what i mean cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7630,310.1,Chris,,,"i was just gonna say since we're talking about the scientific tools that um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits that stuff "
7636,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i was just i was thinking that you know if i'm if if if the astronauts got like you know thirsty or something then they could just like drill a hole in the moon maybe and then they could drink the water like that maybe "
7639,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i was just looking at the clock and i i see about it's time for us to go to lunch so i just wanted to let you know before we call "
7642,310.1,All,,,"hi "
7647,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me a teacher i hadn't been on this class i already know all about space "
7650,310.1,Farrah,,,"off okay okay student and so do you mind to share with us what your response was "
7652,310.1,Farrah,,,"sure i sit on that scientists could use the microscope to find the water "
7655,310.1,,,,"i have a same thing "
7659,310.1,Oliver,,,"us to look at small stuff that's right so um have you used a microscope in your other science classes yeah yeah well you're stomping mr smith's clash "
7664,310.1,All,,,"um "
7666,310.1,,,,"yeah "
7668,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
7670,310.1,Chris,,,"nasa send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate "
7673,310.1,Farrah,,,"and lunar orbiter "
7677,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i guess i didn't know because you had student read it "
7684,310.1,Jazmin,,"so you class did a really good job at using your past knowledge on microscopes ","i don't understand what why is my answer wrong "
7686,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i said that i used to small machine "
7689,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think it was the one you had student read a lunar orbiter "
7692,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ice deposits "
7697,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think so "
7700,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sure okay this loan or what oh well land damone south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
7702,310.1,Jazmin,,,"look for ice deposits "
7706,310.1,Jazmin,,,"water "
7709,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
7711,310.1,Luis,,,"i said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit "
7715,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i guess i guess not i mean it and helps them breathe on on the mon "
7719,310.1,Luis,,,"and helps them breathe Lunar Orbiter. "
7723,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for taking my time to work with us "
7730,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh it means that like you got to say it so that i believe you "
7735,310.1,Oliver,,,"convince me that you gotta know more than me "
7737,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah "
7739,310.1,Chris,,,"if if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it and they like the try to get you to do with a big that's convincing "
7741,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess like when i am trying to advocate for our environment and i go out and i i pass out leaflets to try to tell people what they can do i try to convince them "
7745,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm well i convince class that i'm like i'm the best at minecraft ever i just want to remind you all saw that my dad is actually an astronaut "
7748,310.1,Luis,,,"i beat them and i say ah you can't do it as well as me and then i play the game and i get the most points and and i say you're a loser "
7750,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
7753,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i just i mean i do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water so that seems to be convincing the have water "
7757,310.1,Jazmin,,"good job so you redirected and rethought your answer and you looked back at the text on if there was convincing evidence that water can be valuable ","we can drink it "
7761,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i i know that um i know that the mo0ns not ready to live on so i don't think that i'm convinced that arm but we could we could get water from there because we can't live there "
7764,310.1,Oliver,,,"air "
7768,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it like like what "
7772,310.1,Chris,,,"i have yeah "
7774,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i said they could drink it "
7778,310.1,Chris,,,"what else must miss paul i also saw in this mo story that i'm water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7780,310.1,Luis,,,"because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and i'm "
7782,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
7786,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi it's good to see you hi "
7790,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i had kind of this question like i already know like all about space i know all this stuff so i was kind of wondering like i don't think i should be in this class "
7793,310.1,Luis,,,"okay um the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
7795,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that "
7797,310.1,Luis,,,"oh i didn't really read that closely because i thought i kind of knew this stuff "
7799,420.3,Luis,,"okay so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely so that we can learn more information about space okay ","okay "
7801,420.3,Farrah,,,"so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7804,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah absolutely um okay so in paragraph paragraph three "
7806,420.3,Farrah,,,"you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely after it talks about the water "
7809,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay so i think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you you like find something "
7815,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i think so so like my answer wasn't quite right but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water "
7819,430.3,Jazmin,,"but that's not what they used to discover it okay so what we need to do is we need to go back in the text and find what the scientists used to discover that there was water on the moon ","sure so basically what i said was that that nasa used a small machine and that's like the machine that they sent to the moon "
7823,430.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay so small machine um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
7826,430.3,Luis,,,"um so like the lunar orbiter i guess like okay so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like "
7830,430.3,Chris,,,"Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um, i went to nasa so like with my dad and we saw that like the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i guess i'm a little confused like is student wrong or like i'm not quite sure "
7833,430.3,Chris,,,"the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater "
7838,430.3,Jazmin,,,"so they used the lunar orbiter to investigate "
7841,430.3,Farrah,,,"they found lots of um well they found water they found amounts of water "
7848,430.3,Jazmin,,,"so they used the lunar orbiter to discover water and so we have to go in just a moment but before we went i just wanted to thank you for teaching the class and i especially wanted to thank you for like really spending time with us too and being really patient with our different answers like sometimes we give our science teacher he says we gave him stress hives and i'm really really patient and also like i think that you really helped us to like work as a class to something like don't get along and you really helped us to work strongly as a class so thank you so much "
7854,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah so here's the thing um i don't really need to be in this class because i know all about space so i don't think i really need to be here "
7856,430.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can do that "
7859,430.3,Farrah,,,"so we were just talking about our answers to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you can ask us anything you like "
7862,430.3,Farrah,,,"right "
7868,430.3,Chris,,,"i think that what they must have sent was um like oxygen tanks and masks and like suits and stuff like that because um they they have to like breathe in space like my dad took me to nasa and we saw like that they had to use all this equipment and everything so like they had to use it if they were going to space "
7876,430.3,Oliver,,,"yeah so basically um i think i had the same answer is student and we thought that it was the microscope that they had to send to basically like look at the water and see the water so um i guess what i'm trying to understand is like did is like um why my answer is wrong like efforts because we're all working together to get a better answer like maybe why is my answer wrong "
7882,430.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah um so they it was the they sent like a microscope and something else "
7887,430.3,Jazmin,,,"um let's see i guess um well they talk about so i think they sent a small machine "
7890,430.3,Jazmin,,,"so is that just what i was missing was just the name of it "
7892,430.3,Jazmin,,,"so yeah i think it was a small machine the lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon and then i guess it lands on the moon and then it would discover the water i think "
7897,430.3,Jazmin,,,"i just want to thank you we have to go to lunch now but i just take the moment you for working with us and for being so positive i think sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were very patient with us and you really took the time to listen to our answers and i just wanted to thank you for that "
7902,430.3,Luis,,,"hi yeah okay so basically what i was gonna say is that um you know i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
7905,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah i could do that "
7913,430.3,Jazmin,,,"okay um so for me i said that scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon to me i say that nasa sent a small machine okay i was kind of curious like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong "
7918,420.2,Jazmin,,"so what i'm sort of wondering could you be a little bit more specific perhaps in identifying what that small machine could possibly be so to be a little bit more specific you would then you know want to choose perhaps the lunar orbiter ","it says that the small machine this machine is the lunar orbiter "
7920,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it says in the reading that you need nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so the lunar orbiter must be this small machine "
7927,420.2,Chris,,"so to be a little bit more specific you would then you know want to choose perhaps the lunar orbiter ","Well, okay. So I went to nasa with my dad and when we went there I saw that scientists, a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like I i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what I mean, that's the tools that they're using "
7932,420.3,Chris,,"but if you were to look through the sort of the article a little bit more you know sort of try to pick out some keywords ","that's a good question i guess you might need other equipment yeah you couldn't just like use the suit and be like oh yeah here here's like the water you can use other stuff that's a great question "
7935,420.3,Farrah,,,"unfortunately we have to go on to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
7938,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool "
7940,420.3,Luis,,,"i yeah he works at that that's dennis space center i'm in mississippi and he kind of like commute so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like "
7942,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah we talk on skype all the time "
7944,420.3,Luis,,,"awesome "
7948,420.3,Oliver,,,"um ok so my answer was no you know i'm because i don't think it's ready yet "
7953,310.1,Oliver,,"okay well good job yes it was in the text it does state that ","oh yeah you're totally need it and like i i could see that like maybe it would be maybe valuable but i don't think it's like that convincing the evidence because it seems like it would cost a lot of money and take a lot of time to like we don't even really have spaceship that go to the moon very often "
7957,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and will and i was thinking like what you could do with all the water is like grow a garden all over the moon like you could make this moon garden "
7961,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah that's really cool "
7965,310.1,Farrah,,,"actually i was asking because i my opinion is that it's actually not very convincing evidence that kind of agree with with student so i don't know if you wanted someone who thought it was convincing is because i kind of think it's like not but i think that it will be valuable but not for a long time "
7967,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah "
7969,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i think in like sure it could be very valued it just seems like people you know like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see and i just think it will be valuable you know long time "
7971,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so actually um so what i was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know stuff like that um and then also like you know water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7977,310.1,Chris,,"yes that was within the actual document that you can split up water into oxygen and hydrogen that is very good student you were able to find that key evidence very quickly ","yeah i was just gonna say that so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we like you know that in the reading it says that "
7986,310.1,Luis,,,"um so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and so like in particular i really wanted to thank you for asking me so much about my dad and it was really fun to talk in this class and share with class about like some of my life and and it was really cool like you helped us to understand like that we needed to evidence from the text step we were eating and that that was really important and you really asked us to explain ideas like why we thought that something was you know valuable or not valuable and like student and deb have different ideas then like student and i and you really i'm like listen to our opinions so i i feel like really good about class and i'm really excited to like learn some more from you so thank you so much "
7989,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i just was i just wanted to say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all there is to know about space "
7993,310.1,Jazmin,,,"reach every reader okay the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8001,420.1,Oliver,,"so what i want you to do for just a couple minutes look back at that question and i want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words that you feel that are important to you or something that stands out to you ","i think we're good "
8005,420.1,Oliver,,,"um in the question or in the whole text Yeah. Um, okay. So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water. "
8007,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i circled equipment because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment "
8013,310.1,Farrah,,"very good job looking deep into your question and circling the keywords ","yes so what i did was i said equipment and discover "
8015,310.1,Farrah,,,"discover because they were asking like you know what i mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water "
8019,310.1,Farrah,,,"i just i just was wondering like i didn't i wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong "
8022,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm i'm mostly focused well i guess yeah i thought about discover just like student i circled equipment and water "
8027,310.1,Chris,,,"oh oh well that's a good question but i was gonna say first just real quick because i went to nasa i know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i saw that they weren't in the in the reading but if your question about like what do we like we use tablets and we use pencils and paper "
8035,310.1,Jazmin,,,"in the in the question "
8037,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i circled equipment and discover "
8040,310.1,Jazmin,,,"it's time for the next class so thank you so much for working with us "
8042,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut "
8049,310.1,Oliver,,"and i was very impressed about how class took time to look over and look into the text and had some really deep connections and that you really thought about the things that we were asking ","sure okay so it says um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable "
8054,420.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the question's asking and help us to go back to the text so first what i want you to do is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or words that you feel you don't understand okay ","i think i know the word but i just wanted to check evidence what does it mean "
8059,420.1,Farrah,,,"evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something so it's like proof "
8062,310.1,Jazmin,,"She used like a Luis use that his dad was an astronaut. Made a connection and we're studying about space and on the moon. You made a connection a detective. ","we're looking to see if the if the like okay so is there like good proof i guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and i think it is and i think you could even grow a garden on the moon "
8065,310.1,Jazmin,,,"because they talk about the water and they said like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water water to grow plants "
8067,310.1,Jazmin,,,"you can stay hydrated "
8070,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes so if there was water you could make a garden you could grow it using the water "
8073,310.1,Chris,,"i love that so you went back into the text when you said you didn't understand that word ","Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence. And I was thinking that, like, basically. Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. "
8076,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well cuz okay so i actually knew already because um well i guess they said it in the reading but they but like i knew that because i visited nasa and i know all about nasa and i could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship "
8079,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah true very true very good "
8084,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm so i'm so sorry but unfortunately we do have to go to watch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for that in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us use evidence from the text in our answers and you also helped us declare hi hi "
8087,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you how are you "
8091,310.1,Luis,,,"you know i think we did um yeah i enjoyed it but i just have a question i don't really think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space "
8093,310.1,Luis,,,"oh man i know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like you know what i mean like all kinds of stuff "
8098,310.1,Farrah,,,"we can work super fast okay so we actually just finished "
8103,310.1,Farrah,,,"so pearson was talking about how he went to nasa and he like got to go and visit with his dad and so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the like um like it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up which is pretty cool "
8107,310.1,Farrah,,,"i was wondering can i ask you a quick question "
8110,310.1,Farrah,,,"um so i just wanted to ask you um so it seems like my answers like not quite correct what i said about like the microscope i'm just trying to understand why "
8112,310.1,Farrah,,,"sure my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8118,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i can read it okay so um let's see our scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert are we reading paragraph one "
8121,310.1,Oliver,,,"you're right that was a different page sorry yeah you're right scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
8125,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so um so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
8130,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so i think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like stuff like that you know "
8133,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think they use the small machine machine and it's called a lunar orbiter i think that's what they used to discover the water "
8138,310.1,Jazmin,,,"sure okay number three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8140,310.1,Farrah,,,"a microscope "
8142,310.1,Farrah,,,"to look closely like to see something close "
8144,310.1,Farrah,,,"um like different than a microscope "
8146,310.1,Farrah,,,"um the like a magnifying glass "
8150,310.1,Chris,,,"um so i saw a microscope like in science class um like i've seen it in a couple places but i think we've all seen it in science class and also we've like you know we've seen it in movies and stuff like that "
8154,310.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah so i just unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially wanted to thank you for really asking us like to think about what we already know about space and like how that like really gets us excited to like work together and talk about it with each other and sometimes our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so patient and very very very thoughtful and how you asked us questions i just wanted to thank you "
8156,310.1,Farrah,,,"thank you "
8159,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah we can you yeah we can hear you hello "
8162,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm sure i can i think student has his hand raised "
8164,310.1,Luis,,,"oh no problem i just um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space so i don't really have like a lot more to cover "
8166,310.1,Luis,,,"um well there's like i know all about like rocket launches and i know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like i know that like space is a vacuum like all that kind of stuff "
8168,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah that sounds pretty good "
8170,310.1,Luis,,,"all right "
8173,310.1,Farrah,,,"yes so basically i said that um that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess what i mean is that like in paragraph three it talks about how you have to be able to use the microscope to even see the water "
8175,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i pretty much have the same place and the same idea um i think adding to farrahs answer like i think that you have to use the microscope to see it you can't like find it i guess unless you can see it "
8179,310.1,Oliver,,,"Um, yeah. So should I go back and read? "
8183,310.1,Jazmin,,,"basically what i learned was that that they sent a small machine up to the moon "
8185,310.1,Jazmin,,,"it's in paragraph two and actually i have a question about that so i knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers and i'm wondering like what might be wrong about my answer "
8188,310.1,Jazmin,,,"like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used "
8190,310.1,Jazmin,,,"machine was the lunar orbiter "
8192,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so basically i was gonna say kind of like i guess kind of like what student said before like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff so like i guess i'm wondering like is that i guess that's not the answer but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water "
8196,310.1,Chris,,,"okay yeah that sounds great "
8198,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah awesome "
8200,310.1,Oliver,,,"on yeah we get that we checked and kind of read through everything "
8202,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah "
8205,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess we were listening to as you were saying this stuff with with student so i guess the the difference is like what's the best answer and like i guess you like you said you have to you have to find the water before you can use the microscope to see the water so they couldn't have used the microscope to discover the water unless they unless they knew it was there "
8208,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah no i agree and i think that makes sense to me "
8213,420.1,Jazmin,,"so then that is why sometimes when we're looking at questions we got to be really careful because sometimes they'll try to trick you by throwing in a little something that could be the answer but you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give by throwing in a little something that could be the answer but you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give now student what's your question ","so actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment but i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us and also sometimes we don't necessarily get along as a class but you really encourage us to like work with each other and listen to each other's answers and then come to like a better answer ourselves so it just to thank you for doing that "
8215,420.1,Jazmin,,,"reach every reader sounds good okay "
8219,420.1,Luis,,,"um well it's actually more like a comment i i already know all about space so i don't think i have to be in this class "
8221,420.1,Luis,,,"well cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer um so you wanted to talk to us so i feel like i kind of know everything "
8223,420.1,Luis,,,"that's a good point okay i'll stick around "
8226,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay so basically my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
8230,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah because we could okay so we should look for i should look for more equipment "
8232,420.2,Farrah,,"i think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer we'd have a complete full answer to that question ","okay i'll take a look "
8235,420.2,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so basically what i was thinking is like that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
8238,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah okay what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
8243,420.1,Chris,,"It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers. We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response. Does that make sense. ","so yeah so like the equipment not the not about so what should be the answer right "
8245,420.2,Chris,,"usually it's best when we answer a question if we just stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now ","cool okay "
8249,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i said that nasa sent a small machine and but i was wondering like why my answer was wrong because it seems like the right answer "
8252,420.2,Jazmin,,"how do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response because there are lots of small machines in the world right ","yeah "
8255,420.2,Jazmin,,"if we go back into the text we can see the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer ","I think I know I think I was just, I know what this machine was so is the answer. The Lunar Orbiter. "
8258,420.2,Jazmin,,,"when i looked at it i sadi it investigated because it's small machine that's what discovered it because it was investigating "
8262,510.1,Chris,,"you built off your answer i appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing ","yeah i just i did check on the the text and what i saw was you know when i was looking at it i guess i was wondering like but i've been the nasa so i know that like your scientists and astronauts use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits i guess i was wondering like why that's not the answer "
8267,510.1,Chris,,,"Yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover, oh! what equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8270,510.1,Chris,,"okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components ","that equipment is discovering the water on the moon "
8279,510.1,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i circled the same thing as student scientists found craters full of water on the moon nasa sent a small machine scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and all kinds of other stuff hi how are you doing today "
8282,510.1,Luis,,,"we're doing well we're trying to figure out the answer to this question yeah and i i have a question i'm just wondering i already know all about space like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help with anything "
8284,510.1,Luis,,,"okay well that sounds okay i guess i can hang around for that "
8291,510.1,Jazmin,,,"um i can answer well basically in paragraph two it says nasa send to small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
8293,510.1,Jazmin,,,"do you want me to read anymore "
8297,510.1,Jazmin,,,"well they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them "
8300,510.1,Farrah,,,"yes so i was kind of wondering like why my answer is is really right or my it might be wrong i don't really understand "
8302,510.1,Farrah,,,"i think so like do i need to i need them they need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way "
8304,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay "
8308,510.1,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so like basically i think luis's thing about like well like he said before like um scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like i i've been to nasa with my dad and like it was definitely um they had like all that equipment they have like the shuttle they had the boots and like the oxygen tanks and all this stuff like um do you think that like i guess i'm wondering like why that might not be right "
8310,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah like why that's not like the answer "
8312,510.1,Chris,,,"okay that makes sense "
8315,510.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so actually we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today it was really nice to meet you and it was also really nice like you're very patient with each of us and you really listen to what we had to say and really like made us feel like we were being heard when you are talking to us so we really appreciate it thank you so much "
8319,510.1,Luis,,,"i'm good i'm good i'm scares me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
8322,510.1,Luis,,,"okay "
8331,310.1,Luis,,"and so i love that class are all thinking about the story and are using the text to help support your answers using the text to help support your answers ","um it's asking what equipment do they use to discover water on the moon "
8333,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay oh yeah because we will use equipment in pe class "
8335,310.1,Jazmin,,,"we also use it in science class to "
8338,310.1,Chris,,,"i think discover is like when you find something "
8348,310.1,Farrah,,,"i use the microscope and my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong so no one's answer is wrong it's just that some answers are "
8351,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i was gonna say about the microscope and i'm so when i thought i thought was the right answer because they talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph "
8354,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay "
8361,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i got my answer from paragraph to i don't know what's wrong with mine "
8368,420.2,Jazmin,,"and so your answer you said nasa sent a small machine so i would like for you to tell a little bit more about the small machine so looking in the text what could we add to expand and give more details what top of small machine was it to expand and give more details what top of small machine was it ","i'm looking "
8370,420.2,Chris,,,"you know what a teacher i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
8372,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah it's really cool there i had a great time with my dad "
8374,420.2,Jazmin,,,"ok i see it says that nasa scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter "
8378,420.2,Jazmin,,,"investigated "
8381,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm all right there says and i was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
8383,420.2,Luis,,,"crater "
8388,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh it set of eyes deposits were really small "
8394,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch well "
8396,420.2,Oliver,,,"i was just gonna say thanks for taking my time to work with us and we'll have to see you next time "
8399,420.2,All,,,"okay bye "
8405,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good okay i think i got this all figured out so i got it i understand now "
8410,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay so um we were reading that up first the sentence in a second paragraph and so now i think the answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposit "
8420,420.2,Luis,,"i just i would like to build more upon your answer ","asked about because that's what it says on a story okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate and then i added ice deposits from the next sentence you see how i thought "
8428,420.3,Jazmin,,"so i would like for you to read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon luis's answer that he gave us ","to confuse the lunar orbiter the right answer because they don't talk about the learner or pioneer in the third paragraph "
8436,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay this is kind of like with this is where i got my answer from "
8439,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh "
8445,420.3,Farrah,,,"all it showed us the water they found is microscopic being you want people to see if you were looking straight at okay so you can't see it you need a scientific tool called microscope to look through the closely so you need it to look at the water okay so you need the microscope to look at the water and we know that the water is what oh microscopic "
8447,420.3,Farrah,,,"that is really really really really really really really really really really small "
8454,420.3,Oliver,,,"to investigate ice "
8459,420.3,Chris,,,"it was in the form of ice you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 yeah okay "
8465,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i'm trying to think i'm still kind of confused "
8469,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay well i'm trying to put all of the words from paragraph to paragraph three together and i i'm confused i don't know how to do that "
8474,510.1,Jazmin,,"sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer ","the lunar "
8476,510.1,Luis,,,"investigate ice deposits "
8484,420.3,Oliver,,"sometimes we have to realize that when we're looking for answers just because it's in the paragraph that doesn't mean the information is needed to answer this question ","i was microscopic "
8490,420.3,Oliver,,,"orbiter was arm ah the lunar orbiter was investigating "
8494,420.3,Oliver,,,"microscopic "
8497,420.3,Chris,,,"me on the moon so we're going to try to put all of our pieces together now to answer our question "
8502,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it investigated "
8504,420.3,Luis,,,"microscopic ice on the moon "
8508,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh wow okay teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but wow i really really appreciate how you you help us understand all the words in the question and to use all the evidence from that story and our answer and you you made me me feel really valued and and when i had an idea to share and you listen to it and you told me how how my idea was good or maybe not good but still yeah this was for working with us "
8511,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi "
8514,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water "
8516,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it's called the lunar orbiter "
8519,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah this is student i just wanted to say um i don't think that i have to be in this class because i kind of know like all this stuff about space already i don't really think i needed this stuff "
8522,420.3,Luis,,,"so okay yeah "
8524,420.3,Luis,,,"um so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely like if if something's really small then you like look at it that way "
8527,420.3,Luis,,,"um well i guess i don't really know exactly how it's used on the moon but i'm kind of imagining like you know like maybe people look through it "
8529,420.3,Farrah,,,"um sure um i actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon but it seems like that answers not right i'm a little confused about why "
8532,420.3,Farrah,,,"the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8535,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it's called a lunar orbiter "
8537,420.3,Farrah,,,"i'm interested in the microscope "
8539,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah we all have it on our tablets "
8542,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i can do it "
8545,420.3,,,,"i'm student that okay the third paragraph "
8547,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay um third paragraph that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it even if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8549,420.3,Farrah,,,"like that the microscope um i guess that it's something that like you would use to study something up close "
8552,420.3,Farrah,,,"it's really small "
8555,420.3,Farrah,,,"no i guess not a lot cuz it um yeah i guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see "
8557,420.3,Chris,,,"oh yeah it's student i don't really have a question about the microscope but i have another question um should i save it "
8559,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah definitely "
8563,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so i was just wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at like all the spacesuits and like all this stuff and like i definitely saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that like student was saying so like do you think they use those things "
8566,410.2,Chris,,"But I don't think that they necessarily, this articles necessarily focusing on those things just because it's focusing more on the moon's climate, rather than specific equipment on the moon. ","i'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading i didn't know that before today "
8571,410.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i sort of knew but actually i just had to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to tell you that it was really cool like having you here because you really listened to our answers and you help us listen to each other's answers and and that was really cool because sometimes we don't listen to each other very well and it was awesome that we were able to do that today so thank you so much "
8574,410.2,All,,,"hi good "
8577,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah i can't "
8579,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah well i was gonna say like i already kind of know all about ease so i don't think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this "
8581,410.2,Luis,,,"oh man i know all sorts of stuff i know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space it's a vacuum so you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and i know that like "
8584,410.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah "
8586,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay um let's see so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest "
8590,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look ice deposits in a large polar crater "
8592,410.2,Luis,,,"um i know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon and i'm like it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is "
8600,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i don't really know very much about like this is the first time i like learning about it "
8603,410.2,Farrah,,,"lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar "
8605,410.2,Farrah,,,"it's like i think it's like a big hole like on the moon "
8608,410.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i can imagine i guess i'm still kind of use like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find "
8611,410.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah ok so the paragraph let's see they say in the last paragraph paragraph three and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely "
8616,410.2,Oliver,,,"um well it looks like the microscope is there to study the water um and like look at it really closely i guess i kind of think the same thing i student like how could they find the water if they can't see it "
8620,410.1,Chris,,"microscope is used to discover water but the article is thinking more in general of what equipment would be used along with the microscope ","okay i have been to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so "
8622,410.1,Chris,,,"what i'm thinking about "
8624,410.1,Chris,,,"no that's just what i kind of knew "
8635,410.1,Jazmin,,,"number two which is which one do you mean number "
8637,410.1,,,,"oh we can possibly answer that but unfortunately we have to go to my next thank you so much for working with it thank you "
8642,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
8645,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i think i got this all figured out now so i think all good "
8648,410.1,Luis,,,"i yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
8651,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon "
8656,410.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so i said that yes the evidence is convincing and that's because astronauts wanna and they can stay hydrated and and you can't survive without water "
8662,430.2,Luis,,"And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen. So instead, let's focus on your opinion. So is there. Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. ","um um yeah i mean i think so cuz you can take the water and you can like what i was saying you can split it into oxygen and hydrogen like you know what i mean like you can do like some really cool stuff with it so yeah i think it's definitely value "
8666,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's really good that they don't have to carry it in the ship's it "
8668,430.2,Chris,,,"the astronaut and like the spaceship "
8672,430.2,Chris,,,"um well i guess i just kind of know that you know what i mean like that that waters really heavy and it it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water and it makes spaceships really "
8674,430.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways "
8676,430.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah yeah for example future astronauts drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft "
8684,430.2,Oliver,,,"um okay so basically my thinking is that like i don't think it's it's very like convincing evidence that it's valuable because the water is not ready yet and we don't have like the like you know the equipment to like take the ice and make it into water like i think it would be maybe like in the future but it's not like useful now "
8687,310.1,Jazmin,,"i really think that you did a really good job identifying and separating the idea of what is valuable now versus later ","and it's just another piece about like i guess like the when student was saying this stuff about the water play you know what i mean like this this this do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our our speech like rp "
8689,420.2,Chris,,"So you don't want to have an opinion. Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true. Yes, Chris. ","i i was i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
8691,420.2,Chris,,,"oh it's okay i read that there could be a piece on them like 2020 or "
8696,420.2,Chris,,,"oh some some article in a magazine yeah i don't know if it's true either because it seems like that would be really hard to do but i think if they had a face they could use the water to survive in the base "
8706,420.2,Farrah,,,"so i just would surely we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that you use evidence in our answers because sometimes we just kind of like say our answers but from what we think that we don't use evidence and you really make sure that we were using the evidence but like beyond that like you really asked us about like how we got to our answers and you listen to us as we explained our ideas and i think that class here for leave value and like even beyond that like you like we're really clear with us like what we needed to work on and like let us know like you know you need to do this and think about this with your answer i think that was really helpful because i think sometimes we get confused about what we should be answering like from the text or like from our background knowledge so it was so much fun working with thank you so much "
8708,420.2,Luis,,,"i have a question um i already kind of know a lot about space already so i think i need to be in this class i don't need help with any of this stuff "
8714,410.2,Luis,,"But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes. So let's look at the question again. I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. So your answer doesn't really relate to that question. Do you understand that. ","yeah i think so i think so "
8716,410.2,Luis,,"so what do you think may be a better answer as far as because again your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space but as far as discovering water oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that ","wow i guess i didn't really read it that well closely so maybe i didn't i didn't i didn't really read it "
8718,420.3,Luis,,"so maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay "
8729,420.3,Chris,,"So, specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. So your answer needs to have something specific from the text about how scientists discover water on the moon. So if you'll go back in and try to find a specific so if you'll just go back in the text and try to find some specifics on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay yeah i can do that sounds good yeah "
8732,420.2,Oliver,,"alright so talk about what you found not what student found so just go in and maybe read it and just again we're looking for what equipment the scientists use to find water and talk about yourself not another student that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read your question i know exactly what you're talking about when we answer and talk about yourself not another student ","okay "
8734,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah "
8738,420.2,Farrah,,,"i'm wondering though because we had to work on it together is my answer is my answer wrong "
8740,420.2,Farrah,,,"no it's student um i was just wondering like if if my answer is wrong like why it might be wrong "
8742,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh okay great "
8746,420.2,Farrah,,"maybe you can just go back over the texts and try to find a way to relate your answer back to the question you answer the question but maybe instead of saying you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely relate it back to water just to make your answer just even more solid that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read your question i know exactly what you're talking about when we answer ","okay yeah "
8750,420.2,Chris,,,"um okay so this is the thing that i'm kind of wondering about like basically i'm wondering like when i went to nasa with my dad like we went and we saw like all these space suits and all that stuff like the oxygen tanks that student was talking about so like did they have to use like this space suits and like the oxygen tanks to like go and like study the water like i'm just a little confused "
8756,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah that makes sense "
8759,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah it does "
8762,420.2,Oliver,,,"um so we have to go to lunch now but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for a second for for working with us especially like you were very patient with our answers and you really listened to our answers and also we were able to listen to each other better because you were really listening to our answers and i just really appreciate it and wanted to make sure you knew that thanks "
8766,420.2,Luis,,,"hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
8771,420.2,Luis,,,"uh huh "
8773,420.2,Luis,,,"um okay the equipment they use to discover the water "
8775,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay it's like when you got a space you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star and you're like oh wow you know like i discovered her new star i discovered a new planet like that "
8778,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah no no no no you're right yeah oxygen tanks we don't we don't discover water with the tanks we just we don't need them to breathe on the moon "
8782,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answers wrong "
8791,430.2,Jazmin,,"what i would like you to do though is instead of just saying nasa sent a small machine we need to make that answer specific by using the name of the machine ","If they just said, okay, a small machine. I mean, I guess, I guess no. Um, okay. So if you wanted to know the small, um, I guess, to tell you something about it. "
8793,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah tell me something about it and what else what identifies that machine ","um what it looks like or what it size "
8795,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah my name "
8798,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah your name so probably the machines name as well ","yeah yeah "
8801,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so i just have to add more at the name and stuff to it "
8804,430.2,Jazmin,,"yes just make it more specific and tie in the question so instead just go in and answer what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon ","Okay. "
8806,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i think i got it "
8809,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits "
8816,430.2,Chris,,,"like you said to student the name of the equipment the name of the equipment that they used oh yeah i didn't write the name of the equipment "
8822,310.1,Chris,,"You do a great job of talking about the question. So you obviously understand the question. As far as that goes. . ","OK, OK, OK, I can do that. "
8824,310.1,Oliver,,,"hey mr martin i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did when i say thanks for taking time to work with us what we'll have to see you after lunch "
8826,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
8831,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
8833,310.1,Luis,,,"i think i got it this time "
8841,430.2,Luis,,"so you're picking up on key parts of the text that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's important So I really like to do is the race format. So we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence so right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen but i would like you to restate the question and then answer the question because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable ","Okay. okay so i gotta say yes or no um and then i write then i so i gotta put a couple a sentence before before i write before my answer so i just got to like add a couple more sentences first that says yes or no "
8844,420.2,Luis,,"yes so what you'll do is for example you are going to restate the question so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","yeah i "
8849,420.2,Luis,,"would say there is convinced so you're answering the question and you're reciting that question there is convincing evidence that let me see you again sorry there is convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so there you restated the question you answered the question then you would say in the text what it says water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and then you would explain why that's important ","i gotta write all of that stuff that's a lot "
8851,420.2,Luis,,,"okay "
8857,420.2,Jazmin,,"great yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water you answered the question and you provided evidence you also explained your evidence the only thing i would like is just the restate the question ","yeah yeah okay okay yeah cuz i did say yes "
8860,420.2,Jazmin,,"right if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon can you class and then you're off you're saying yes you're just also bringing the question into it ","okay okay all right "
8862,420.2,Farrah,,,"mr teacher i'm still confused "
8869,420.2,Oliver,,,"Okay, I'll read it, but I guess that's why I was confused because I felt like you know I did better this time. And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six. yeah me too i mean i did read it this time and and and and and number six is how that it'll take a lot of time and money so that sounds to me like you know it's not right so that means no "
8874,420.2,Oliver,,,"your said to student that he has to restate the question and an answer the question and give evidence okay so i guess i can restate the question but i feel like i answered the question "
8877,420.2,Farrah,,"and then you need evidence to support your answer and then you found the evidence from number six that's perfect just provide that evidence and then explain found the evidence from number six that's perfect just provide that evidence and then explain ","okay okay so so i'm not wrong my answer is not wrong "
8880,420.2,Chris,,,"okay okay um okay yeah mr teacher i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
8889,420.2,Chris,,"really what we're looking for is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable yeah so that that's a good train of thought so now if we'll just restate the question answer the question ","Okay so you can't tell that I need more evidence or I have enough evidence right cuz I pulled it from the story. "
8891,420.2,Chris,,,"but i "
8893,420.2,Chris,,"i would say that you do need more evidence your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard but i would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good ","okay ok "
8900,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok ok ok ok i think i'm thinking about it i on i just have to add more to my story um but i i also just looked at the clock and it's it's time for the next class um but i do want to appreciate that i feel like you did you you made me feel valued in and how i was thinking about the question and i think i do understand that i just need more specifically to add more evidence um yeah i think are sorry student and i was just i felt kind of good to cuz i feel like i know that what i need to work on as to add more evidence to and to i guess um i'll say more about the question itself as aren't right "
8903,420.2,,,,"okay great oh thanks mr teacher this was really good okay we'll see you next time bye thank you bye "
8905,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i know like all about space so like i don't think i need any help like i don't think i need to be in this class "
8910,420.2,Jazmin,,,"let's see okay the question is what equipment do you use to discover water on the moon "
8913,420.1,Farrah,,"okay great thank you so does class have any keywords that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for ","um i just wanted to check what what is a keyword "
8915,420.1,Farrah,,"a keyword is an important word that is going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question ","oh okay gotcha "
8918,510.1,Farrah,,"so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment ","um so okay so that's really interesting so like the arm so like the key the keyword would be like what what like equipment like equipment is that a keyword "
8921,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah um i would say like like a tool or like yeah like like a tool "
8925,420.3,Chris,,"a tool absolutely that is perfect so if you class could take a second to look back in the texts and find different equipment or tools what equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text ","So I actually had kind of a question. I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA. And when we went. We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that. So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools? but i was wondering but do you think they they use them but did they did they not use them to to measure things with the microscope like the astronauts i'm like i guess it's not in the in the reading and i was wondering about that "
8929,420.3,Jazmin,,"i want you class to first think about equipment or like student said tools that would be used and then let's think about how they would be linked to discovering water on the moon so once you to narrow down tools that would be used to discover water on the moon helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon but let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools oh we've already get some ideas student what do you see what do you think ","what i think is so it's like what i said was like the small machine and then when i was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine it's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one two that you would have to use right like to get there "
8933,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i can do it this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
8935,420.3,Farrah,,,"so it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits but they they go searching for it like they're the thing that finds it right "
8937,420.3,Farrah,,,"i'm actually i'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this but we have to go to lunch so before we go though i just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and i think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting like thank you so much "
8944,420.3,Luis,,,"me "
8946,420.3,Luis,,,"just shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
8949,420.3,Luis,,,"sure okay it says oh what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8953,420.3,Farrah,,,"a tool "
8956,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah so um one on are playing a video game when i use my xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool "
8962,420.3,Luis,,,"okay well i was gonna say that to death so um ok ok so when we go to pe sometimes it's not a tool but sometimes a pe teacher when we're playing basketball you'll be like okay class go get the equipment and we have to go get the basketballs "
8965,420.3,Jazmin,,,"find water "
8971,420.3,Jazmin,,"to find water that's absolutely right so i want you class to take a second to look back in the text and i want you to circle the words that are equipment ","circled to but the one i circled i think is right so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
8974,420.3,Jazmin,,,"the small machine and the scientific tool "
8978,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay this isn't a small machine coated lunar orbiter to investigate "
8983,420.3,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter "
8989,420.3,Farrah,,,"it makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water so why why i don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped "
8993,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8999,420.3,Chris,,,"oh um you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on yeah also student i think i think i guess we didn't read that fully i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
9011,420.3,Oliver,,"when we're given a question we have to look at the keywords but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific you were on the right track with the word equipment and looking for keywords that related but we need to make sure that it it fully answers the question so another suggestion is once you have found the keywords reread the question to see if these keywords answer the question Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text. ","um no i'm sorry to interrupt but if i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we got a gold "
9013,420.3,All,,,"thanks okay see you later "
9016,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in that spot i already know all about space "
9022,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
9028,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay i think it's saying like i'm like um what what kind of things did the astronauts use to find water on the moon "
9035,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay well there's another word story it's a tool a scientific tool so that's how i know the microscope is right cuz that equipment but but i think it's machine because that's what i had and that's equivalent to so i don't know what my answer is wrong "
9045,420.3,Chris,,,"i wasn't in my answer but i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
9053,420.3,Luis,,,"okay i'm not a lot of different equipment "
9066,410.2,Oliver,,"i'm concerned because oxygen tanks did not help the scientists find water ","girl yeah it's in paragraph three it's that one is the last one the last one and this is where i got my answer me too "
9068,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
9070,410.2,Oliver,,,"um "
9073,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me yeah "
9078,410.2,Jazmin,,,"orbiter i have a day yeah that was my answer "
9088,410.2,Chris,,,"no no i was just i was thinking okay i was on a piece of equipment he said the microscope and then student said a different one the small machine and since it says you want me you would need the microscope but not that you do need oh "
9093,410.2,Chris,,,"okay okay um this is this is this is hard to kind of figure out cuz cuz i like i can hear both of their ideas and i think i feel like the keyword is like you would need which says that they they didn't use it "
9099,410.2,Chris,,,"okay okay okay that was good thanks miss pickett it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say that i appreciate it how you you really like asked class questions about their answers so we got we got to kind of think about why we made our answers um and and like how you ask student to like find his answer in the story and um yeah i think i think i'm thinking about now looking at the story and really trying to find more of the words just looking at more of the words in the story to see if that if that will work for the question "
9102,410.2,All,,,"Bye bye. "
9104,410.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing well glad to see you "
9106,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so basically um here's the thing i know like a lot about space and i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff about space "
9109,410.2,Luis,,,"okay um paragraph two nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
9115,420.3,Jazmin,,"all right stop right there for me student excellent job thank you i want class to take a moment and circle the most important word that they found in that paragraph ","no i'm ready to answer "
9119,420.3,Farrah,,,"so with that i circled was ice ice deposits and and i circled it because you know you had one because they say in there that the ice deposits are very small and so like you have to you have to use the microscope to see the ice deposits and ice water "
9122,420.3,Oliver,,,"um so i circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits "
9125,420.3,Chris,,,"um yeah so i kind of went in i was looking at like um i guess lunar orbiter "
9128,420.3,Chris,,,"well it just kind of looked like the you know man like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine you know they said like what equipment i just i don't know it seemed like the most machine or equipment looking word "
9132,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i circled the same thing small machine i'm talking about the lunar orbiter "
9136,420.3,Luis,,,"well okay so i didn't really read it that closely "
9139,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah so i just didn't really know what to like what to circle i just figured yeah but i know in the lunar orbiter is "
9141,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass but it's like you look at smaller things "
9144,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it said that "
9146,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah we said that basically that it was the lunar orbiter and it something that went to the moon and it was something like like that was the craft or the spaceship that like went up to the moon and landed and like found the water "
9150,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i agree with student i'm because i'm not really sure like well student had a question about it yeah so my question was like how do you like i'm not quite sure why it sounds like maybe the lunar orbiter is the answer but i'm not really sure why the microscopes not the answer you know "
9152,420.3,Farrah,,,"um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
9155,420.3,Farrah,,,"equipment "
9160,420.3,Luis,,,"okay yes i think that the most important word is discover because like finding it okay and student you had your hand up what would you like to add yeah i agree with student i i think i'm around now to thinking that the lunar orbiter is the thing that discovered the water "
9167,420.3,Farrah,,,"um well it's basically it's the lunar orbiter i think i think that's a lot more clear now we actually have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and especially i wanted to thank you for really like working patiently with each of us and like drawing out the answers kind of piece by piece and letting us do our own kind of like thinking as we went along and then like connecting with each other's thinking was really cool since because we don't always get along as a class so that was pretty cool thank you so much "
9170,420.3,Luis,,,"um thanks teacher "
9173,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
9175,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so i know that astronauts can't breathe and space so they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff "
9179,420.3,Luis,,,"Mm hmm. Um, maybe they use like I'm a shovel to dig it up. "
9186,420.1,Farrah,,"and i want you to either circle or star the word that you think is most important in that question ","okay i think the most important word is equipment "
9188,420.1,Farrah,,,"um because it's like the first noun in the question "
9191,420.1,Chris,,,"Yeah okay, I'm Chris. I think the most important word is water. "
9193,420.1,Chris,,,"the whole the whole story is called water on the moon so "
9197,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay i can do that it's me student okay so um so like there's water on the moon they're looking for the water and then they find some water on but it's not a lot of water so then they have to use a microscope to see the water "
9201,420.1,Jazmin,,,"teacher "
9203,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i thought i did that so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9205,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
9208,420.2,Chris,,"and we know that a microscope isn't the only tool that's used so can you give me a little bit more detail in your answer like what was the name of the small machine that was used okay see if you can find it ","if it's jazmin's i saw that one the name of its lunar orbiter "
9212,420.2,Chris,,,"you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
9216,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay well you said that it was what student and student said but i i don't understand why me and student are wrong "
9219,420.2,Farrah,,,"cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me "
9221,420.2,Oliver,,,"i thought it was something that would find some water but i feel like that's not it now "
9225,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh oh ok ok so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story "
9228,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um yeah it's cause it's cards it comes first in the story "
9230,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay okay well it's time for us to go um so i want to take thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time "
9232,420.2,Oliver,,,"bye bye "
9236,420.2,Luis,,,"think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
9238,420.2,Luis,,,"okay so i read the story and i looked for the evidence and i pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain "
9242,310.1,Luis,,"that is true your response is very good because it uses pieces of text evidence ","okay wow i mean i know that we can use oxygen to breathe i don't remember what what you can use hydrogen for "
9244,310.1,Jazmin,,,"we use it for drinking that was my answer "
9251,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so i see the thing that i said about how you could drink it um but then in the paragraph five that you said there was a thing about how you can make fuel so the spacecraft can move "
9256,310.1,Jazmin,,,"no okay it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel um that's what it says "
9259,310.1,Jazmin,,"that is that is a great piece of text evidence that you found ","i guess it would be like how student said where you do split it "
9261,310.1,Jazmin,,,"good split it in two parts "
9263,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so i see what you're saying but i'm still kind of confused "
9266,310.1,Farrah,,,"well cuz i found a different answer and so if if they're right that it could be valuable but what the story says that i'm okay so i said no not for a long time because then the next paragraph it says that it will take a lot of time and energy so it it sounds like they don't actually have the time or the money to do it "
9270,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
9273,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay okay okay well i have that same answer as student because i read that class para i i think i think yeah yeah "
9275,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay cause on the thing that student said about drinking it i mean like class needs to drink water and then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space "
9278,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um so i was thinking about what class said and i'm oh yeah i would say the thing about us breathing the oxygen to "
9280,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i think so too "
9282,310.1,Farrah,,,"no no i would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story "
9284,310.1,Chris,,,"and well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
9287,310.1,Chris,,,"that they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home "
9292,310.1,Chris,,,"um if we call refill on the moon people wouldn't get stranded on the moon "
9294,310.1,Chris,,,"we wouldn't run out of gas "
9296,310.1,Jazmin,,,"no we'll just get more gas "
9301,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah okay thanks so much mr teacher i'm a class i do feel like you helped me i'm looking keep looking up a question more cuz me and student had a good answer but i think we missed some of the other evidence and the story to build our answer so um thanks for helping us think about reading my question and all the words in a question and i'm looking for all of the best story "
9303,310.1,Oliver,,,"thanks mr teacher we'll see you next time "
9307,310.1,Luis,,,"um don't excuse me but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
9309,310.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can stick around for that right "
9314,420.1,Oliver,,"but what i want to do before we start is take a minute and look back at question number one you class are going to be looking for keywords in the question important words that you could look for back in your text that way we can answer the question ","okay so i found the keyword i thought equipment was really important "
9317,420.1,Chris,,,"um yeah i i thought water was the important word "
9322,420.1,Jazmin,,,"so for me i thought discover was maybe the most important keywords and so i thought is like you think the equipment that then you're like discovering using the equipment so i thought discover "
9328,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i was just gonna say i had changed my answer "
9330,420.1,Farrah,,,"thank you "
9334,420.3,Chris,,"okay so if we are looking in paragraph number three look and reread that real quick and remember we are looking for the words equipment and discover let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph ","they said that the waters microscopic and so i thought like if that was a keyword than that but you said that will actually okay you said that that wasn't like all over the text so actually what i was looking at is that they said you need the water they found that was it the water they found because i was thinking discover like that keyword and and i thought found was the word "
9338,420.3,Farrah,,,"in my in my revised response yeah so i said the lunar orbiter was how they discovered the little bits of water "
9340,420.3,Farrah,,,"so i saw it in paragraph two and that was yeah that was right "
9342,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah i just wanted to check actually that okay is my new answer okay it's the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic "
9346,420.1,Chris,,"and your answer is closer to a correct answer but what were what was the keywords in number one what were the keywords ","um okay it wasn't water it was equipment and discover right Oh. No, it doesn't. So that actually makes sense. So I didn't really answer the question, I just was I did. I understand. Oh, that's exciting. I really understand "
9348,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with thank you so much "
9350,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah hi so i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good "
9352,420.1,Luis,,,"ok "
9357,420.1,Farrah,,,"i thought was like my keyword was convincing and then valuable "
9360,420.1,Chris,,,"um well i said evidence as as well so like i guess it goes together like convincing evidence "
9364,310.1,Jazmin,,"yeah exactly that was a great thought process putting convincing evidence and valuable together ","water is a valuable resource "
9367,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well actually i was just saying i'm still kind of confused "
9372,420.2,Jazmin,,"so the best place to start is the keywords in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer ","did i give like convincing evidence in my answer "
9374,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah cuz i said that yes that there's convincing evidence and i said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water "
9381,310.1,Luis,,"yes and that is correct and i like that you found that because you used that text heading to help lead you in the right direction ","um yeah so for me like okay so i was looking at the text this time because you were saying we should do that like we should read it closely and i thought that like convincing evidence is like the fact that i even it's all the paragraphs like it says in paragraph four water on the moon could be valuable useful in lots of ways could be astronauts could drink it and then also in paragraph five it says moon water could be useful in other ways it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen "
9387,310.1,Oliver,,"that is correct and i like the way that you've gone back and put the keywords from the question into your answer ","um yeah so i was just gonna say that i read that there was that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
9392,420.2,Oliver,,"okay um i have not heard that but let's think about this text though okay so you and student and student student did you have a question your hand was up just a second ago ","i was actually no i think i forgot what i was gonna say So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you and like specifically i wanted to thank you for a couple things like you help us understand like how to look for keywords and how to make sure that we were like "
9395,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me "
9397,420.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
9401,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah definitely because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks "
9405,420.2,Luis,,,"um let me see "
9415,420.2,Jazmin,,,"Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong, cuz I did pull from that I said a small machine. And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know? "
9417,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter "
9420,420.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you "
9424,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah cuz i found that in the in the story like it was really cool that they have all these craters and like and and they thought the moon was a desert but then the craters like it's got all this water in it "
9427,420.2,Chris,,,"want me to read read where i got my answer from or you want me to read where student got her answer from "
9430,420.2,Chris,,,"my answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says scientists have evidence the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters so that's that's where i got my part but i do hear what you said about like why what did they use to find the polar craters i guess "
9432,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i read the whole thing and and i wanted to tell you when you were talking student about you know the oxygen tanks that i went to nasa with my dad and so i know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
9434,420.2,Chris,,,"so yeah i think i might have seen that at nasa i just realized that cool "
9437,420.2,Farrah,,,"it was in paragraph three when it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
9439,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i have the same answer as student and i remember when i was looking in the story it was saying the water they found is microscopic i'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so i figure they must have brought a microscope to to see the water "
9442,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch so i want to say thank you i really appreciate how you gave like all of us like a chance to kind of talk you know and to share our ideas so that was that was pretty cool okay bye "
9445,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
9447,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me and i shouldn't be and this class um i already know all about space "
9449,420.2,Luis,,,"mhmm "
9453,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah sure okay so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon and they they have to wear as spacesuits because they can't breathe on the moon and they go up in their space shuttle that's how you get from you know like from from the earth to the moon those are some facts about space that i know "
9455,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah they're astronauts "
9458,420.2,Oliver,,,"i think the equipment was a microscope i had a microscope too "
9460,420.2,Oliver,,,"well a microscope is a machine "
9462,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that's close to my idea cuz i said in my answer i said that nasa since the small machine but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9466,420.2,Farrah,,"that is correct but if you want it to be more specific in a good answer you could have said nasa sent a small machine and it is called a lunar orbiter so student you were on the right track ","yeah sure okay like in the third paragraph they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic and then it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i was thinking you know like a scientific tool is kind of same thing you know as equipment so that's how i came up with that answer "
9469,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i know that the question was asking for water and i know that we have to find equipment so i was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it you need to have a tool called a microscope so kind of like what student was saying about how microscope is a tool i was thinking you know like how you said um like is equipment and the paragraph says that they found the water and that was what the question was asking about finding water yeah that's what i have "
9472,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah sure cuz question was asking you know them finding the water like like how student said so i was looking at the text okay where do they find the water and it says in paragraph one that at first they didn't think that there was any water and they realized that they were wrong and they found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater so like that's where i found my answer "
9474,420.2,Chris,,,"i highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water but i didn't see discovering there so i just i found that found and water and so that's how i use that you know i also want to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
9476,420.2,Chris,,,"like those oxygen tanks so that they breathe and like there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death you know "
9482,420.2,Chris,,,"like in paragraph two nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter lunar orbiter okay that's the one that student said i think and they say that's like four glasses glasses is is an object but that's not that's not so i mean it's the same one that student said right the small machine called the lunar orbiter right "
9487,420.2,Oliver,,"and then to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name and what is that machine called ","i definitely well i i know it's called a lunar orbiter cuz i'm student just set it and student said it too and you said it but i'm sorry to interrupt you i know it's it's it's time first of all to lunch i know this was really short and i really appreciate how you really took some time to help us really kind of think about the words in the question and and look for other words and the story too bye "
9491,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah basically i was just gonna say like i kind of know all ready all about space so i don't think i need to be in this room "
9494,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i can do that "
9506,420.1,Luis,,"and i want you class to first start with looking back in the question i want you to either underline highlight or circle keywords in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question so take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and i want you to circle the keywords in this question word in our question that we need to use to help us answer this question so take about 30 seconds to look back over the question and i want you to circle the keywords in this question ","yeah so i underlined let's see when i looked at it i underlined equipment and i'm um i underlined equipment that was the main word that i underline ok "
9509,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah absolutely okay so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined and discover and i was just gonna say like i was kind of wondering if i was to kind of use like what my answer was wrong "
9513,420.1,Chris,,,"so we actually had a kind of a decision about my so i underlined up with ben and water and student underlying discovery "
9516,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and so basically i repeat visits as he like the question say like what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be an important thing to look for "
9523,420.2,Luis,,"that question by using the two words that you class underlined as keywords so student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks how could you be more specific to the passage ","um you mean like to the reading "
9527,410.1,Luis,,"but if you were to underline the words equipment and discover how what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon oxygen tanks are pieces of equipment but they don't really go with the water on the moon ","so so i "
9533,410.1,Luis,,,"guess more specific well i guess like i guess i'm not totally sure like what what to look for because i thought like the equipment was anything that they you know anything that they use to like find the water so like if they were on the moon they'd have to use like suits and masks and stuff um but like you know what i mean like i'm not quite sure like what else like to say "
9537,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah it was um in paragraph two it's in the first sentence "
9546,410.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i guess i'm still because like oh you know like i think that the microscope was what they use like it feels like i guess i don't know does it seem like that was what they used to find the water because they said in the in the writing that you couldn't see the water unless you use the microscope so i was thinking like that's what they used to discover and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much okay "
9558,420.1,Luis,,"what words can we underline in that question to help us answer the question ","so i put in for my answer i underlined equipment "
9560,420.1,Luis,,,"um well maybe discover "
9564,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so the underlying reach every reader equipment and discover "
9571,420.2,Jazmin,,"So I want you guys to look at the answer that you put for this question. I want you to read over your answer and I want you to think to yourself, how could you be more specific, when answering this question to take a couple seconds to look at your spot. ","well i guess i was just gonna ask if if if we should all answer but it sounds like we should actually under sure like which is why my answers wrong and i realized that should be more specific but like you said totally sure like how i should be more specific "
9577,310.1,Jazmin,,"you're right nasa did send a small machine but to give a more specific and best answer you could have put nasa sent a small machine and gave the name Answer and asking why ","it makes sense so he needs to say like like he might be more specific about like what it is "
9582,520.1,Farrah,,"so next time you have a question you can underline your keywords to help you be more specific ","i'm i'm not totally sure i think i feel like our answer is right each "
9587,410.2,Farrah,,"okay you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that is a tool that they use but the question asked about discovering water on the moon ","well i guess when i think about discovering the pot i think like they used the microscope because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water unless they look through my school so i thought like that's how they discuss "
9591,410.2,Chris,,,"well i i went to nasa with my dad and i know that um you know scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks and so i guess like should i should i add that to my answer "
9595,420.2,,,"But yes, it's looking for something specific. So that's when you would want to refer back to the text. So when it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. that is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools like you said a mask ","So is the tool. I guess I'm wondering, like, is it like we're still or it sounds like the other one that just was still "
9601,510.1,Oliver,,"so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer ","um yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially want to do that like that thank you for helping us really focus on the word discover and like really focusing on like how important that word is and like also like you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and like make sure that we were on that like we were looking at the text for what we were saying um i really appreciate that was really fun working with so thank you so much "
9603,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just thinking and i wanted to share that basically like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class i don't need any help "
9609,510.1,Luis,,,"know to do that yeah "
9613,510.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so basically what i was thinking about was that um you know like that the microscope was was the tool and the reason why i thought that and i think it's like pretty pretty important is like so like is it's in the text because it says like you know we use a microscope or you couldn't see the water "
9619,510.1,Jazmin,,,"well i was just when you say i wasn't sure why why my answer was bob do you mean like i just wasn't quite sure "
9629,420.1,Farrah,,"what are the some of the main main words in that sentence so just for a second here go back to the question maybe underline what you think the main parts of that question is what you need to get out of it ","i underlined it "
9636,420.1,,,,"um it's like really small "
9638,420.1,Oliver,,,"and you need a microscope to see the water "
9646,420.1,Chris,,,"and i see and i guess like well okay so i that's a question i have and i think that student had the same question yeah i was wondering like that okay so here's what i thought like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and suits and stuff like that like luis's answer so i was thinking that like i'm wondering why that wasn't the answer "
9653,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i was this i said yes nasa sent a small machine "
9655,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah it was just or big "
9663,420.1,Luis,,,"the next class has to come in but i just wanted to thank you so much for being with us before we have to be to thank you so much for everything um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut i just wanted class didn't know that "
9666,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
9673,420.1,Luis,,,"oh so like i gotta do like from not my like knowledge but like from the passage um well yeah i saw you that i knew were kind of cool like i saw that i'm like there was the lunar orbiter which is a really cool spacecraft and then there was also like a talked about microscopes but i don't think microscopes are the answer "
9676,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well actually it's a really good question i think that why like here's my thinking on this like i think that they asking the question they're like what equipment it scientists use discover water on the moon and i'm thinking well maybe they studied the water with the microscope but they discovered it right with the learner or so that's what i was thinking like as we as we look "
9682,310.1,Oliver,,"okay i can see how you got there i can see that so good job reading into that good job they're reading into that ","um so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small "
9684,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
9686,310.1,Chris,,,"well i guess i'm not sure like which equipment exactly because you could do a scanner or like something like that you know what i mean like i'm assuming they're like probes stuff like that so maybe you didn't need the microscope i'm not sure "
9694,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i will i will just be about like i was wondering if this was maybe the answer is nasa use a small machine to get to the water this is that a good answer Like you have to say what it is, so that not just small machine, you have to say they like to say like what equipment so like the lunar orbiter like nasa use the lunar orbiter to get to the one "
9701,310.1,Chris,,,"so in part three it says which part that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth "
9704,310.1,Chris,,,"gotcha you need a scientific microscope to look really close "
9708,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i guess like the passage is saying like you have to use the microscope i guess is that right "
9715,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i'm so sorry but unfortunately that's the end of our time but before we go we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular we really wanted to thank you are like making sure that we use like the stuff from the text and we didn't just make up like our own thoughts on what was happening and you also really helped us to clarify like you asked us a couple times like what we were thinking and it was really interesting to like think about like why did we come to dance you know and then when you did that it really helped us to understand like okay like that's what you're looking for us to teach this and there's like you know what i mean like it's hard to know like what the teacher wants us to do and i feel like it was really clear so thank you so much "
9717,310.1,All,,,"bye "
9719,310.1,Bennett,,,"um well my my answer came from the same from paragraph three where i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely "
9721,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me "
9724,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry i shouldn't be in this class i know a lot about space "
9726,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
9729,310.1,Farrah,,,"um a space shuttle "
9731,310.1,Farrah,,,"reads text to herself quickly nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
9735,510.1,Chris,,"see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer ","what student said "
9737,510.1,Chris,,,"oh whoa whoa to find the water the craters i figured they use their eyes cuz it said there was a lot of water there "
9744,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah but my answer is in paragraph one it's not in paragraph three Okay. okay reads paragraph three to himself in a whisper okay but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9747,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh oh okay "
9749,510.1,Chris,,,"rereads to himself oh no it says the water they found was microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you're looking straight at it oh okay "
9752,510.1,Chris,,,"the machine the microscope "
9754,510.1,Chris,,,"well yeah i think i think if it if you can see with your eyes and then chapter three or the part three yeah that's you got to you got to use a microscope "
9757,510.1,Luis,,,"they use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there "
9760,510.1,Luis,,,"um is it the microscope i'm not sure "
9765,510.1,Luis,,,"okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits ina large polar crater ah oh yeah so that's what's going to find the water in the craters you know i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff ok the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposit in the polar craters "
9771,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah well i guess i mean i hear what they're saying but i guess i don't know why i don't know how how we got this answer about the small machine to find the ice deposits i was looking for the keywords and the question "
9778,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate this is the one that student just read right that's lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists think about one ton of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold on total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one person might drink in a day I thought it was equipment and discovering water. "
9784,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i mean i guess i guess they use the lunar orbiter to go to the south pole and then they found more water on once they got to the south pole so um yeah i guess that that will be it oh i'm looking at the clock and it that it's time for us to go to lunch i know we just met um and it was a really short time but i do really appreciate how you you you kept asking us questions and asking us to read back the paragraphs to to help to help us understand the text "
9786,510.1,Oliver,,,"thank you okay okay bye class say bye bye "
9790,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know like all about space already "
9792,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i guess so "
9794,510.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well we're excited to work with you "
9800,420.1,Farrah,,"so if you could find the question on your paper and circle the key points or circle like one or two words in the question that could lead us in the text to find the correct answer ","yeah okay so what i circled in the question was i said let's see i said equipment and discover "
9802,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so basically i circled the same thing as student "
9804,420.1,Oliver,,,"i said equipment and discover "
9808,420.1,Chris,,,"Yes, so for me I circle. let's see i circled scientists and water "
9812,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yes so basically i circled i kind of circled much the same thing i circled discover and equipment i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong "
9814,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay "
9816,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so for me i circled on equipment and scientists "
9821,420.3,Farrah,,"so look back in your passage and see if you want to change your answer from the beginning using those keywords that you circled look back in the passage i'll give you about two minutes ","so i when i went to circle the keywords i basically ended up with the same answer and that's because i was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water and i still think it's the microscope so i thought extra hard about it but i still have the same answer "
9824,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah basically the same as student and for me like i was thinking about science equipment and discover and so i also think that like it has to do especially with the microscope "
9827,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i could try to see like i'm not quite sure "
9831,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i was gonna say they use the small machine to get to the moon and they use the small machine to find the water "
9834,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well i was just gonna say that okay so i went to nasa with my dad and when he and i went to nasa together we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks so i was kind of wondering about that "
9837,420.3,Chris,,,"well like it wasn't in the in the meeting but i was thinking like they had to use it you know so like i was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment "
9840,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so i was gonna say us with the machine was and i was gonna say the machine is the lunar orbiter "
9843,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah because you said look for this specific machine and so when i went back and look for the specific machine that was the equipment itself lunar orbiter and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just wanted to thank you for working with us it's really fun to work with so thank you so much "
9846,420.3,Jazmin,,,"we're doing good "
9848,420.3,Luis,,,"up yeah i was just excited i wanted to tell class make sure class knew that actually my dad is an astronaut "
9850,420.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah i totally well "
9855,420.3,Farrah,,,"ok so my answer was basically no like i don't think it's very convincing but not for a long time "
9862,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay so i had basically i said that know that it's not ready yet and i was looking in paragraph it's paragraph under the water is a valuable resource and it basically was saying that like in paragraph six it says like um that scientists need to come up with a plan for getting the water and then making this plan will take a lot of time and money and i guess i was just thinking that like basically it's not ready yet to get the water from them like you'd have to do a lot of other stuff to get the water "
9867,310.1,Jazmin,,"yes that is true i like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and i do agree with you ","yes okay see i said that yes that the water would be valuable and the reason that i said that so astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and so what i was looking at basically i wasn't a paragraph four and they were saying that basically the astronauts could read the water you know what i mean and also was gonna say like something that i thought was really cool is that you could use the water and you could grow a garden and you can have all these plants and things like that with the water that's up there "
9870,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so for me basically what i said i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where i got that from was let's see where did i oh oh okay in paragraph five purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket "
9878,310.1,Chris,,"yes very good i am very glad that you went back in the text and were able to find support for your answer ","oh i was just going to share my answer okay so water is heavy so it's good they don't you know have to carry it in the ships anymore and i think for me like where i i saw it like what is it it says in paragraph or the waters happy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft and that would be a big deal to have that and then i also said like student water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and also into oxygen and you can use both of those things Thank you. "
9881,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah we saw the answers i think that well do you have any thoughts um yeah i mean basically my thinking is that it's not that it will be useful like in the future but i think there's just so many problems on the way costs too much money and like we don't right now like how much like to do in space like i don't know i guess i'm still kind of wondering you know what i mean "
9889,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular. i wanted to really thank you for like taking the time to make sure that we were circling keywords and making sure that we were like using our keywords you know me and like you're even more than that that we were like that we were using evidence like that's a really big deal because sometimes we don't always like base our answers on the text that you really like wanted to make sure that we were using evidence so i think class went back and and like really closely with you'd like everything they needed to do you know we take the quiz this was really cool so like thank you so much for working with us and it was really cool that just like you were really made us feel valued and i guess thank you so much "
9893,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
9896,310.1,Farrah,,,"yes we do "
9900,420.3,Oliver,,"i want you to think about what equipment was used and if you see any equipment mentioned if you can use your pencil and underline it okay so i'm going to give you a few seconds to do that ","paragraph five is that the one from the second reading about waters of valuable resource "
9903,420.3,Oliver,,,"gotcha just wanted to check "
9908,420.3,Chris,,,"um okay so i underlined um let's see machine lunar orbiter i guess glasses but i don't think they mean it that way those things "
9911,420.3,Farrah,,,"i said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two i'm still confused like why are my answers wrong "
9914,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so imperative to well i underline the same thing like small machine i underlined lunar orbiter because i figured that was something that you know that's that's i know about that crap um yeah that's what i put but i also like wrote down like some other stuff because there's lots of other equipment that they used "
9918,420.3,Farrah,,,"it was the only equipment in paragraph two "
9920,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah basically that was on the same because it was all the equipment that i could see "
9923,420.3,Farrah,,,"still confused because i i i guess why the microscope is it you know what i mean is it an answer too because it says what equipment is used to discover water like they said that you have to use the microscope to see so how did they discover what if they couldn't see "
9925,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter "
9930,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so i got my answer from paragraph three and i basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water if you were going to like discover it how could you discover it without without seeing "
9934,420.3,Luis,,,"ah yeah okay so i got my answer from like i know about like space and stuff so i already kind of knew the answer to this question i don't think i really need to be in this class because i don't really need help with this stuff you know "
9938,420.3,Chris,,,"um well i mean i guess i don't i don't know i don't really have anything to say about it like i think it was like i think in the in the in the text it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water um and like that made me think like that's you know what i mean like that was what they had to find "
9940,420.3,Chris,,,"i'm not sure "
9942,420.3,Chris,,,"oh okay yeah i guess not "
9945,420.3,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so i actually was kind of agreeing with student like my dad took me to nasa and we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have like um like boots and oxygen tanks and all the stuff you know what i mean like they needed all that stuff to go up into space so i guess like i kind of thought maybe that was missing "
9949,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well i guess well i guess what i thought was that it was this small machine that they sent was how they discovered the water i'm not really sure about chris's answer but um like student and oliver's like is my answer wrong was it not the small machine that discovered the water "
9954,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i guess actually okay so when when we talk about it together like i guess you need the lunar orbiter but um i guess it kind of still think it's like i kind of still think it's the it's the microscope because like student was saying like you have to see the water to know that it's there so like maybe the microscope was on the lunar orbiter "
9959,420.3,Farrah,,,"um yeah okay so i agree i think that um like i think that that probably that's true that like the microscope was maybe attached to the lunar orbiter or something cuz they had to discover the water but they say that the water is um that it's basically like they like to use the word microscopic like it's so small that you can't even see it "
9963,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well i guess i'm not totally sure i mean i guess maybe maybe that's the case like maybe the lunar orbiter could have like a microscope attached i think that could be possible "
9967,420.3,Luis,,,"well i guess like i'm kind of thinking i don't know like i mean i guess yeah i see that they could probably use the the lunar orbiter to go up there um i guess it's not really it doesn't really say if they're astronauts are not like if they're astronauts up there then that would be one thing but i don't really think there are "
9972,420.3,Chris,,,"um so like i'm kind of just i'm kind of thinking i mean i guess i'm kind of thinking that if it was a like an unmanned craft like like a like a probe that they sent up with the lunar orbiter was like didn't have any astronauts then then i guess they don't need the the gloves and the stuff so yeah they could use the microscope like on the orbiter and like control it with a computer or a robot "
9981,420.3,Oliver,,,"um i'm not quite sure what wait when you say what did we use like what did we use in class Um, well, actually, um, I would say that what seemed to help us find our answer was all like listening to each other. um and actually we have to we have to actually go to lunch but before we go i did want to thank you for that specifically because i think that we all did like have a chance like to work with each other and to like really like listen to each other carefully and closely and really hear what we were saying to each other so that was pretty cool and i really really appreciate that you did that because we don't always get to listen to each other and kind of learn from each other's like thinking so thank you so much "
9984,420.3,Farrah,,,"so i was thinking about like what equipment like i know about microscopes from like science class and so i was thinking like you know if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope you know what i mean "
9986,420.3,Luis,,,"um wow it's kind of more of a statement um i think i should be in this class because i know like all this stuff about space like i practically know everything about space "
9991,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah yeah so i was seeking about oxygen tanks because like well okay so i was seeing whenever i see like movies with astronauts or whenever i think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever i think like the astronauts would have to have you know what i mean like if they were going up into space you have to have that "
9995,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so when i look and small machine she basically i was looking in paragraph two and i was in the first sentence it seemed like that's what they sent they sent a small machine to go look at the water so that's why "
9999,420.3,Chris,,,"i was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying okay so there's ice deposits in the polar crater and i was thinking that like ice is is basically frozen water and i like i kind of know that i'm from science class and um it made me think like well that's where the water it you know "
10003,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so what i was thinking was when i was looking through the reading i was seeing like so in the in the question in the question it says what equipment did scientists use and it made me think like look for equipment so then i went i looked for equipment i saw microscopes and i totally know about microscopes "
10005,420.3,Farrah,,,"um yeah i guess i'm still wondering like cuz you know we're in the small class to try to help our answers like i guess i'm wondering like why my answer's wrong "
10015,420.3,Chris,,,"um yeah so i guess my my question was so like i went to nasa with my dad and i guess kind of like what he was saying like you know like scientists use all this other equipment like oxygen tanks and mass and suits i guess i was wondering like on the lunar orbiter like why that ones the answer and not like other "
10023,420.3,Oliver,,,"thank you so much for working with us it's time for the next class so we have to go "
10026,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i think but i think student has his hand up should you call on him first or i guess student "
10028,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay let's see so paragraph two the name of small machine was the lunar orbiter "
10030,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah it's kind of more of like a comment i guess than anything like i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all about space already and like i feel like i kind of know all this stuff so i don't really need any help "
10034,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess so i guess so i guess i just like i kind of know all this stuff you know "
10038,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i'm looking right now did you want me to give the answer "
10041,420.3,Luis,,,"okay um i guess in paragraph two um let's see i guess it could be the lunar orbiter "
10047,430.3,Chris,,"i just want to make sure we understand can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water can you go ahead and look there and give me a response ","okay um the water they found is the water the found is microscopic like so i guess so was the water like are they talking about the water molecules are like the water i'm kind of confused "
10050,430.3,Chris,,,"microscopic's kind of like really small "
10053,430.3,Chris,,,"so like a small amount of water "
10056,430.3,Farrah,,,"oh "
10058,430.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i have a question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer might might not be right like in terms of the question "
10062,430.3,Farrah,,,"gotcha so did they discover it with the microscope "
10064,430.3,Farrah,,,"okay so you just needed to see "
10066,430.3,Farrah,,,"okay "
10068,430.3,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so um i was just went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so did they use that stuff to find to discover the water "
10070,430.3,Chris,,,"gotcha okay so so was like like they may be need that stuff but they didn't like use it necessarily this time "
10072,430.3,Chris,,,"okay okay "
10075,430.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so it looks like um student and i circled at the beginning we circled the microscope because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small but um i'm guessing that they probably used other stuff as well it sounds like they they used this on the lunar orbiter to go also and like discover the water "
10078,430.3,Oliver,,,"so um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to really thank you for like getting us to try to listen to each other's opinions and also really listening to our responses and to making sure that each of us had time to work with you today that was a big deal that we each had time to have a chance to work with you thank you so much "
10082,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay so here's the thing i kind of know all about space so i don't really know like i don't think i have to be in this class i don't really need any help "
10089,430.3,Farrah,,,"okay um let's see the moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
10092,430.3,Oliver,,,"um okay um second paragraph and number two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
10097,430.3,Farrah,,,"so let's see paragraph three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely Yes. So, okay. I was just wondering, as we were reading it through like because I know we're in this group for for help. Like, I was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong. "
10101,430.3,Jazmin,,,"basically i wasn't quite sure about microscopic i think i know what it means but i wasn't totally sure "
10103,430.3,Jazmin,,,"it means something that is small "
10106,430.3,Jazmin,,,"It's the microscope. That was Farrah's answer. "
10111,430.3,Chris,,,"you yeah i didn't actually so i didn't really see anything in here but i kind of i did have a question that came up from reading and it was like i went to nasa with my dad and there was like like we we saw all these spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all the stuff that the astronauts had to use like did they not have to did they not need those things is that whether or not in the reading "
10117,420.3,Farrah,,"now the next step i'd like for us to go through is which of these three paragraphs actually addresses the question all right take a moment look through and see just which one actually addresses the question ","okay so to me i thought that um well i think it's to paragraph three because they're talking about the water that they found and they're talking about how you'd be able to see it like how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it "
10122,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so like i don't really think that it's the microscope i think that it's the machine the lunar orbiter and the reason that i think that is that it it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question like discover what it does "
10132,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really like helping us kind of work together as a class and really focusing on like having us explorer answers together as a class and like not sort of just like giving us the answers like sometimes teachers just kind of give us the answer and we don't really we don't really think about like what we're supposed to be thinking about and we did a lot of thinking today i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool "
10135,420.3,Farrah,,,"we're excited to work with you "
10145,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah that sounds great and i think that we all feel really confident now that you said that thank you so much alright "
10148,420.3,Luis,,,"oh no that's okay i was more of a comment really i was just gonna say like i don't think i have to be on this class cuz like i kind of already know all about space "
10150,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah "
10155,420.3,Farrah,,,"sure no problem ok so my answer was you need to see typical color microscope to look really close "
10159,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i have a good idea "
10162,420.3,Farrah,,,"good okay so when i look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope really close "
10164,420.3,Farrah,,,"it means really small "
10170,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah that's right my name is student "
10172,420.3,Farrah,,,"go ahead i was just gonna student and i have the same answer i think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong "
10182,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so when i was looking i realized that i think the answer is the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer to me "
10189,420.3,Oliver,,,"um so i think that i understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the lunar orbiter but i think i'm still not quite sure why and i'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much for working with us we really enjoyed working with thank you "
10192,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah so i was just say um let's see i think it was talking about like the before lunch i was talking about like craters well so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon and that that was like you know what i mean like they found all this water "
10197,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so when i was reading i thought that okay so one of the keywords in the question was what so i said okay so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding and then when i was looking at the meeting i saw that there was all this water that it was mostly located in the craters so i thought yeah that's where they'll find it "
10201,420.3,Chris,,,"um let's paragraph one "
10205,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have however a usable that there was no water on and we can imagine that i read the rest it so you have plenty of time yeah "
10213,420.3,Chris,,,"um no i guess it's not "
10216,420.3,Chris,,,"no because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water "
10223,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i i think i've got this all figured out so i think i'm good i was just gonna say i think i can go back to my seat "
10234,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i was just gonna say that i was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like i think they understand like so in this being the right answer and i understand that like the nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to discover the water like that that seems like the right answer right so i understand that but i think what i was confused by was that there were like i guess i'm wondering like why like why that was the right answer and like student and oliver's the answer was like about the microscope like is the or even like this stuff about like the spacesuits and the masks that is it just the lunar orbiter part of the answer or should you answer like with all the thing "
10242,420.3,Jazmin,,,"Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So does that make sense in that makes sense to me but like i think that yeah okay so it's the orbiter was like that thing actually found the water and then they studied the water later but first you have to find is that right "
10247,420.3,Luis,,,"so i think it was a trick question because i did not find it and i think that was the thing right like it wasn't there i think i just brought that in from outside you know what i mean like it wasn't in the text there was nothing about like face masks and stuff like that like i think pretty much like i got that from like what i already know yeah "
10259,430.3,Farrah,,"I'll just kind of rush through and pull information from other bits of what I've already read about music, or in this case about science into what we're already reading. but not necessarily applicable to this specific text so maybe in the future use that information but just make sure that you take it maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that ","i'm sure thing so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us to really make sure that we were using evidence from the text in our answers and you really asked us like about our thinking and you really like had us kind of like prove what we were saying by also like explaining what we were thinking and let us take time you like really let us take time to explain our ideas like sometimes we interrupt each other but like you're really made sure that class was listened to and like i think class thought really value and like finally you really explain what we needed to work and you gave us ideas about what what we needed to do to like improve our answers so i think like every single one of us even if we're not like totally on the answer or totally understanding class knows like what we need to work on to get to the right answer and like that's really cool because that doesn't happen all the time so just wanted to say thank you bye bye hi how are you today "
10261,430.3,Farrah,,,"we're doing well "
10263,430.3,Luis,,,"oh um so i have a question i have a question "
10265,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i already know like all about space so like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this class "
10267,430.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can do that "
10271,430.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i have a quick question um so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question how did scientists or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we each had our answers um what would you like us to do do you want us to keep discussing our answers um what would you like "
10273,430.3,Oliver,,,"okay we can do that "
10275,430.3,Farrah,,,"okay so my my question was when i was looking at the text again and we were when we were talking about it um i still think my answer is right like i think that my answer about the microscope is right so i really don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10277,420.2,Farrah,,"we just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what nasa did to find water on the moon ","okay "
10281,420.2,Jazmin,,,"who would you like to go it's student and then student have their hand raised "
10284,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so basically what what we were discussing we didn't agree but i thought that the answer was the small machine which when i was looking was saying that was a was the lunar orbiter um yeah was the lunar orbiter and so with the small machine i think that's what they used to discover the one and that's the answer but i think that student and student thought something else "
10287,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so i'm like here's the thing i basically like my dad took me to nasa and when we went to nasa we went and saw like all of this like um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like student was talking about so like i was just thinking like i think that's missing from the text like i think that's important to have those things you know like how could they go up there without oxygen tanks they had to use that to discover the water "
10293,410.2,Oliver,,"but since they sent a small machine i don't know that we would have needed the equipment for actual people like oxygen things to check that out ","oh yeah um well actually at the end maybe i'm thinking a little differently um like i was thinking so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water is that the idea "
10297,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay gotcha um well we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to thank you for being so patient with each of our answers and for making sure that you were able to listen to each of our answers because sometimes we don't always each like get called on in class and it's really nice that we each had a chance to talk this time so thank you so much for working with us "
10300,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i kind of know like all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to be in this class "
10303,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah i could do that that sounds cool "
10309,420.3,Farrah,,"and while each of you had really good thought processes i want you to take another look at the article and i want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important ","okay so in in the text i picked out the word microscope microscopic and let's see what else yeah microscope and microscopic "
10311,420.3,Farrah,,,"um well i chose them because i think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use and i think that that tells us why it's the equipment because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope so i'm thinking like you know you can't find it if you can't see it "
10313,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong and when i looked at it so the word that i circled i circled keywords in the question i circled equipment and then discover then i looked at the text i also circled in paragraph two investigate "
10317,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah yeah absolutely i always like to talk so i basically um yeah so what i was looking at when i was looking at the reading was i basically was saying like i said equipment too and then i said like what else did i put on yeah but i basically circled equipment and that was it "
10321,420.3,Chris,,,"Yeah I okay so I went to NASA with like that. And when we were there. We saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that. So I was wondering, like, is that part of you know what I mean is that part of how they found the found the water? "
10326,420.2,Farrah,,"i definitely think that those pieces of equipment could be important but i think that we're looking for a little bit more specific piece of equipment that helped us discover water i want you to help each other understand the text and so now that we know the keywords that class thinks i want you class to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water ","so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you "
10329,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i kind of i think i got this all figured out so um yeah i think i'm all good "
10337,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like a complete sentence and like like draw from the from the text right like from the things that we circled or underlined and like say this is why i think that's right so if i was gonna say my answer like i guess well i guess can i still say microscope or i guess it's the lunar orbiter isn't "
10339,310.1,Oliver,,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as Farrah. Your thought process is a lot deeper as well. ","yeah i'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words you know "
10342,310.1,Chris,,,"i wasn't really answering the question so i ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter "
10345,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so basically the first thing i was gonna say is that i'm still a little bit confused and i think what i'm confused about is how like how we can make sure that our answers are complete i think i understand what student did but i'm not quite sure how to make my answer more complete i said nasa sent a small machine then i could add lunar orbiter but i'm not sure how to do more than that "
10349,420.2,Jazmin,,"one thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question as if you were teaching about the question so if somebody was new to reading this passage just like you class were how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you class are reading ","oh that's really interesting i just want to make sure that they they answered the question so that whatever they said like i would want to make sure that it was like it answered the question about equipment and discovering water "
10352,420.2,Oliver,,"sure so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student if you can answer the question and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer ","um so i was just gonna share and i thought this was kind of interesting based on what we're talking about that i read somewhere that there could possibly be a base on the moon like a settlement by by 2024 like that's what nasa was trying to do "
10358,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i don't think it's actually i guess i guess i don't really have a question because i understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not it didn't say those tricky in the in the reading it didn't say that they discovered it using the microscope they studied using a microscope so is that right is that the right way to look at it "
10368,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using the words from the question like the word discover in what we were looking at and not just that but like you have this use evidence in our interests and you also like you asked us a lot about like you help us to clarify what we were trying to say because you asked us like why did we say this or what were we thinking even me and so i think we all really valued in a minute we all you know like like you really were listening to us and it was pretty cool and so thank you so much for coming and you also like beginning explain like what we needed to work on and like how we could improve our answer so i think we learned a lot thank you so much how are you doing "
10370,420.2,Luis,,,"i have a question i already know like all this stuff about space already um like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't really need any help "
10373,420.2,Farrah,,,"we can go one at a time and give you our answers again "
10377,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah i circled the same thing as student um so scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon "
10384,420.2,Farrah,,,"I agree. i think so I would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope. You wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope. "
10387,420.2,Farrah,,,"but i know that we're here in the class to sort of help with our answers but i am not really sure why my answer is wrong it seems it is the microscope "
10391,420.2,Oliver,,,"Um okay, so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye. You have to see it through the microscope. "
10393,420.2,Oliver,,,"because it's so small like the the particles of water are so are so tiny "
10397,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and i think i guess i'm confused like why is my answer wrong "
10400,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i guess what i'm trying to find it says that in paragraph two that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10406,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw like all like spacesuits and and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that people had to use so i guess i'm kind of confused like did they not have to use those things like was that like did they not not need them "
10417,410.3,Oliver,,"but specifically this paragraph address is just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student but specifically this paragraph addresses just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student they do need a lot of equipment to get there you know a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters but this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process ","um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to um i just wanted to thank you for a second for working with us today you were very patient with us and you were very positive the whole way through and we i think we really feel like you were very positive listening to our answers and talking to us today and it's really nice when a teacher listens so thank you so much "
10420,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like um i think i have to be in this room because i already like all out space oh "
10424,410.3,Luis,,,"so i said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
10429,410.3,Luis,,,"so i thought well in terms of the question i was thinking like what did they use to discover the water and i was like well i know that they use like they have to have oxygen tanks and they have to have that kind of stuff in order to breathe so i was like oh yeah okay so that was something that happened to us like even if it's in the reading or not i was like oh yeah well that's gotta be part of the answer "
10432,420.3,Luis,,"However, you really have to go to the text and find specific equipment that is mentioned in the text. so student if you would right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned and if you don't what is mentioned ","okay yeah i guess they don't really talk about like oxygen tanks they talk about lunar orbiter and microscopes "
10441,310.1,Farrah,,"that's great you have mentioned two pieces of equipment that are specifically referenced in the text the lunar orbiter and the microscope ","so i was i'm still i'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong but i can't tell you what i was thinking so basically when i looked at the text like i saw i think it's in paragraph three they were talking about how it's like microscope and he said you couldn't even see it unless you would look through the mircoscope so i was thinking like you know how did they find the microscope if they decide how could they find the water if they if they couldn't even see you know what i mean oh ok so the microscope has to be the answer "
10449,310.1,Farrah,,,"interesting um i'm not sure i have to look at again okay so it looks like well i don't see anything about scientists so i'm guessing no so my question like how did they find it if they didn't use the microscope "
10460,420.3,Chris,,"So I want you to look for that Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon. ","yeah i was i was actually gonna say i'm thinking about what student was saying that like i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like scientists use a lot of like masks at suits like student was saying and so i guess i was wondering like i guess that doesn't if i'm remembering from what you said to student it's not in the reading so it's not in the answer but it seems like that was an important thing to have thing to have like an even if it's not masters i guess i'm confused yeah "
10467,420.2,Chris,,"in the text you need to look for specific equipment referenced in a chapter so student what was your answer to that question did you find specific equipment that was referenced in the text itself because we must always refer to the text ","no i didn't find equipment what i i was looking at was the water so i said that scientists breeders full of water "
10470,420.2,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
10473,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i think that like i got everything pretty much figured out so i think i'm all good "
10476,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i read it carefully this time "
10478,420.2,Luis,,,"i said on water can be split into two parts oxygen and hydrogen "
10483,310.1,Luis,,"okay and i do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specifically mentioned it does in fact say that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen ","i was thinking looking at the meeting because i made sure to look this up and i said like they said i'm that like you can well you could do all the steps of oxygen can like astronauts can breathe it and like hydrogen and oxygen can be used to make rocket fuel you know what i mean like that would seem very valuable to me "
10487,420.2,Luis,,"but that detail you just added is critical that's why it's valuable the fact that when i break it down the oxygen hydrogen astronauts can breathe the oxygen and they can use the oxygen and hydrogen as fuel so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer ","oh thank you "
10489,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i said yes and i said the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
10493,310.1,Jazmin,,"absolutely and that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water ","okay let's really see cuz i'm like i was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right but actually that makes a lot of sense "
10497,310.1,Jazmin,,,"What he said you could you could, but it's super heavy so it takes it takes up all this room like a rocket ship. exactly it seems like it would be really good to have it with your phone right beacuse then you wouldn't have to take as much with you "
10505,310.1,Chris,,,"OK, so my answer was that water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships. "
10514,310.1,Chris,,,"as well so i read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base and i guess if that was true then like it would be really important to have like not only water but like the other stuff so like what he was saying like with the rocket fuel so i'm thinking like the oxygen and hydrogen on that you can make from water like that would be useful as well "
10520,310.1,Oliver,,,"so my answer was i said no because it's not ready yet "
10523,310.1,Oliver,,,"like the water first off like the water is ice so you know what i mean like you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing they said like later on in it they talked about how that the it would take a lot of time and money to like make it happen and so i thought like you know like maybe someday it might be valuable but like it doesn't seem like it's very convincing right now that there's very good "
10532,310.1,Oliver,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch again we have to watch this but um i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today and like in particular there was all these things that you were doing with us that i think really helped us along as like students so like not only did you make sure that we used evidence from the text but you also really asked us lots of questions about like our thinking and you listen like really closely as we explained how we got to our answer you took all this time for us to explain our ideas and like i don't think class ever felt rushed like you know class like yeah i think class felt like they had time to do everything and like not only that but like we also felt really value so we all got to really feel like you know like like like i think like we all had good ideas even if we weren't right and then finally you like helped us to explain what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas on like how we could improve our answers but then you let us improve the answers so it was pretty cool working with thank you so much for being here today "
10536,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher "
10538,310.1,Luis,,,"um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
10540,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
10543,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i saw that they used to small machine "
10545,310.1,Jazmin,,,"no "
10548,310.1,Farrah,,,"have i said that they use the microscope "
10550,310.1,Farrah,,,"is when you can look at things that are like really really small "
10552,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah just like an aunt or something like that "
10554,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm walking yeah yeah like in science class we look at like these little bitty um oh i don't remember the names of it but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny teeny thing "
10556,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba "
10560,310.1,,,,"um i i mean i guess i can see it on the microscope we "
10564,310.1,Jazmin,,,"excuse me i see i see more words in the sentence but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10567,430.2,Jazmin,,"you're answer isn't specific enough about what the details of the small machine so there was a small machine used but what exactly was that small machine used for ","yeah is they said he was caught the lunar orbiter "
10570,430.2,Jazmin,,,"they said it lands at the south pole and looks for ice to pass it and a large polar crater "
10576,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah i see what you're saying um i guess we wouldn't look for a big pond of water with a microscope because we can see that When I read it. i sort of put the craters were full of water "
10579,430.2,Chris,,,"i don't know you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots "
10582,430.2,Jazmin,,,"oh well definitely thinking about the craters i'm student i don't remember what did you say about the craters oh "
10585,430.2,All,,,"No. "
10590,430.2,Luis,,,"face masks they use masks true to green "
10593,430.2,Luis,,,"cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here so we can't breathe that era there "
10599,430.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt you miss i burnt i think i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so thanks for working with us "
10601,430.2,All,,,"okay bye "
10605,430.2,Luis,,,"um let me see but i did want you to i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut okay let's see what i said water can be split into two parts "
10607,430.2,Luis,,,"hydrogen and oxygen "
10614,430.2,Luis,,,"um okay so f fair water is h2o all you're saying hydrogen and oxygen mm hmm and you said that student said oxygen tank okay "
10622,430.2,Luis,,,"okay so so i was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to student and you're talking about them needing to drink on okay so i mean that makes me think you know like water is important to breathe them to drink wait but that's we don't we don't breathe water um okay um no we don't breathe water but we do breathe oxygen okay okay so if water gets like split up into on hydrogen and oxygen then okay help me out student okay so we can drink the water and we can break the water okay so then that's as that the answer was ms abernathy "
10629,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well i was thinking about the water can use you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
10631,430.2,Jazmin,,,"of plants "
10634,430.2,Jazmin,,,"it doesn't have enough water to grow things "
10639,430.2,Jazmin,,,"Oxygen. It doesn't have oxygen. "
10641,430.2,Jazmin,,,"no that could be something valuable "
10650,430.2,Chris,,,"Okay, yeah, I remember where that was cuz i encircled it before okay so miss abernathy i was thinking and okay so water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen the oxygen a brief um what what do we use the hydrogen for "
10653,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay um so in paragraph three is where it talked about this the microscope and "
10658,430.2,Farrah,,,"No, no. "
10660,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah my mom always makes me carry the groceries inside and my arms are always like hurting so much "
10662,430.2,Farrah,,,"ah i think it's got to be pretty big yeah maybe "
10664,430.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah to go to space i figure you got to have a lot of stuff "
10668,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay okay thinking about that they wouldn't might not have enough space because i got a bunch of stuff "
10672,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay one word or can be useful and other ways okay um water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen and i swear i swear i'm password student said astronauts could breathe oxygen can we say that one already the oxygen "
10674,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay so so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that i should not breathe oxygen and that's important "
10679,430.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt miss abernathy but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for helping us keep thinking more and more and more about the thinking and really making us have to keep on talking to each other and thinking about our ideas "
10683,430.2,Farrah,,,"how are you "
10686,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so here's the thing i know all about space like i don't think i really need any help i don't really need to be in this class "
10688,430.2,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can stick around "
10692,430.2,Oliver,,,"that sounds great "
10694,430.2,Farrah,,,"so a microscope is like something that you like you use to see something that's really small "
10697,430.2,Farrah,,,"like well we use it in like science class yeah like to like look at samples of stuff "
10703,430.2,Chris,,,"um yeah i can do that um okay let's see so um i guess in the i guess in paragraph one it says that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um and then like in paragraph two it it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
10706,430.2,Chris,,,"um i guess it could be a couple like it could be any size because depending on like how how big it is like it could be bigger or it could be small "
10713,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so i guess what i saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there i guess that's kind of what i saw "
10717,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well because it sounds like i guess it sounds like there's a little less water but there's not that much water but there's just a little bit of water Actually, I have a question. So if it sounds like then that we needed to use the microscope, but so is my answer wrong. Like, did they not use the small machine? "
10721,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this machine and it was like the lunar orbiter was looking for ice "
10726,430.2,Chris,,,"i guess not i guess they must have used all of them like different like the microscop and the lunar orbiter Um, yeah. I have a question, like so. My dad took me to NASA. And we saw that like astronauts have to use like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like, um, do they, do they like, do they have to use that stuff, didn't they have to use that to discover the water? "
10728,430.2,Chris,,,"oh okay yeah i guess they don't really i guess they don't really say "
10731,410.2,Oliver,,"mr student talks about how they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts but it doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks do they do use them yes but not in this text ","um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for hor having us listen to each other's answers closely because we don't always really like have a chance to listen to each other really closely and it was really nice the way that you like had us listen to each other and try to learn from each other so just like thank you so much because that doesn't always happen thank you "
10734,410.2,Farrah,,,"thank you yeah we can hear you "
10738,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah um but i have a quick question "
10740,410.2,Luis,,,"okay so i can know like all about space and um i don't think i really need help like i don't think i really need to be in this class "
10743,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay i see that "
10745,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so basically you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely "
10750,410.2,Jazmin,,,"so i think that it was the small machine that they sent that's what they used "
10753,410.2,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter in paragraph twol "
10757,410.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i'm actually wondering like why is my answer wrong "
10761,410.2,Farrah,,,"gotcha so they used "
10763,410.2,Oliver,,,"so they used lunar orbiter "
10767,410.2,Chris,,,"yes they use the lunar orbiter to discover it and then they use the microscope to study i think is that right okay that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense um yeah but i'm okay i have a question "
10769,410.2,Chris,,,"okay so i went to nasa and with my dad and i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff to go up into space like they didn't did they not use that stuff to to discover the water "
10775,410.2,Chris,,,"well they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space "
10778,410.2,Chris,,,"no no that that was the the lunar orbiter "
10785,410.1,Jazmin,,"it's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples that's what the question was asking ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you you were so clear with helping us to understand like what we were looking for and we were able to really listen to each other's answers really closely and you made sure that that class had a chance to talk which was awesome because we don't always get a chance to talk during class so thank you so much because i think we all really learned a lot from from each other thanks to you too thank you so much "
10787,410.1,Oliver,,,"hi how are you doing today "
10789,410.1,Oliver,,,"great excited to work with you "
10791,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i don't think that i need to be in this class because i know like everything that there is to know about space all that stuff already "
10794,410.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah i can do that "
10799,410.1,Farrah,,,"sure we can do that um okay so i said you need a microscope to do the water "
10803,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i can do that let's see um i said the water they found is microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a special tool called a microscope to look really close "
10806,410.1,Chris,,,"you'd need spacesuits and like stuff for astronauts like i've been to nasa so i know that you have to use all that stuff "
10811,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i said the small machine but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong "
10815,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so in paragraph two and it says nasa send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10817,410.1,Jazmin,,,"like is it i mean i guess it's to find the water to like you know what i mean like to go get the water "
10820,410.1,Chris,,,"well i guess i still am thinking like i went to nasa so i know that the scientists like us all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff "
10827,410.1,Oliver,,,"mmm hmm actually we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us "
10831,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah you know ah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
10838,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah okay so i said no no not for a long time "
10842,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah so like you know like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable i don't think it will be valuable like now cuz you know cuz we don't we don't know how to i guess we know how would you i mean like it would be really hard to use it so i don't think it's valuable right now "
10847,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet you know what i mean like that we can't we can't just use the water because it's all ice you know "
10850,410.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so i would say water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships "
10852,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water and i was thinking basically what you could do is you could use the water to grow things you could have a garden on the moon in the craters "
10854,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah like water can be split into two parts it can be you know hydrogen and oxygen "
10858,410.1,Luis,,,"on yeah yeah i can do that okay so let's see um in paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways and water can be broken down to two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
10861,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i think like okay you could use it or okay well you could breathe it um and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel "
10863,410.1,Luis,,,"as well rocket fuel "
10865,410.1,Chris,,,"on yeah i guess i just wanted to say this like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important "
10876,420.3,Oliver,,"See all these are good points because this allows us to go back into this paragraph and look at the clues that they have left in this article to help us find an answer to this discussion to this discussion question. ","and we unfortunately have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really listening for answers and really making us feel like "
10878,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i i know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff "
10880,420.3,Luis,,,"okay that sounds cool "
10883,420.3,Farrah,,,"whoa i guess i kind of like um no i just saw the microscope "
10886,420.3,Jazmin,,,"basically what i thought is its a small machine "
10890,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay it's called the number 2 paragraph 2 so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10893,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i guess they used the microscope and the lunar orbiter is that right "
10895,420.3,Farrah,,,"i have a quick question "
10897,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i i was just wondering like is my is my was my answer right or was it wrong "
10899,420.3,Farrah,,,"gotcha "
10901,420.3,Chris,,,"yes so i was just wondering like so like here's what i know is that like i went to nasa with my dad and he like we went we looked all over the place and i know that that like you have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and stuff like that but is that is that not part of the answer "
10903,420.2,Chris,,"um well the question asked according to the text so we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions so we had to find evidence so you might be right from what you know from your dad going to nasa we have to use the text in order to answer the question ","oh so it's like whatever's in the reading ok that makes sense "
10906,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm still kind of wondering about the like so did they did they not have to use like did the astronauts have to use um did they not leave the the lunar orbiter did they stay in the in the lunar orbiter like how did they use the microscope "
10908,420.2,Luis,,,"oh okay "
10910,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i just wanted to thank you for working with us today thank you very much for especially for like really just like helping us to understand and be really kind in how thoughtful you are with sort of like talking to us today so thank you so much "
10916,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
10922,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh i don't know "
10934,420.2,Chris,,,"yes had to be from the craters the craters for the water "
10938,420.2,Farrah,,,"teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
10940,420.2,Farrah,,,"i mean this is me student i looked at over and i don't understand why why the microscope is raw "
10948,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay "
10956,520.1,Oliver,,"so now that you've figured out the full answer what will you do next time when you're looking back in the text ","look at the story again to find a full answer Okay, well thanks teacher, um, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us. "
10961,520.1,Luis,,,"um well i was just excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
10979,520.1,Oliver,,,"microscope "
10985,520.1,Jazmin,,,"i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10994,520.1,Jazmin,,,"see if you can look the shark oh i see if i'm a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11001,520.1,Jazmin,,"so now that we have talked about this how has this changed your thinking alright so next time go back and look in the story to find your answer ","i still think it's interesting story um i guess i just needed more words in my answer "
11003,520.1,Oliver,,,"okay oh thank you so much teacher for really helping us by by telling us the things that we did do well and then i'm like helping us to look back at the story again to find our answer "
11008,520.1,Luis,,,"i thought it was pretty easy excuse me i'm shouldn't be and this class i already know a lot about space "
11010,520.1,Luis,,,"well i said that um you know that they could use um maybe that's uh "
11013,520.1,Luis,,,"I'm oxygen tanks. "
11016,520.1,Luis,,,"Okay. "
11018,520.1,Oliver,,,"well i probably use the microscope arm because it says that thing they let me see what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
11020,310.1,Oliver,,"so you found that directly in the text that's really good ","yeah so i don't know why why i'm here honestly cause i gave an answer from the text "
11026,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i don't understand why my answers wrong um cuz i pull mine from the text to "
11028,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so so how come i'm in this class "
11031,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
11034,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i had the same answer is def so um i know the teacher said that that we we like you said we've got to elaborate on our answers but i used i used all of the like the words from the text and she said we have to use evidence from the text and i did that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean it's right there so i don't i don't know why why i'm in this class either "
11038,310.1,Farrah,,,"and i repeat it i'm nasa to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits this is deposits are very small scientists that have that window of the top layer of a moon surface into about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink and "
11045,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay so you're saying i'm over answers okay but we just had to write more "
11048,310.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to i know a lot about equipment but i didn't see that part "
11052,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch and i know it was really sharp but i do appreciate how you told us that we have we just have to look and look again and look even closer at the story to find more information i guess so thank you "
11055,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay class say hi "
11060,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
11063,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so um i said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
11066,310.1,Luis,,,"i think they use both parts "
11070,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah right "
11073,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful i did too "
11075,310.1,Chris,,,"i did "
11077,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so i said all that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
11080,310.1,Chris,,,"i don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff "
11082,310.1,Jazmin,,,"hmm okay let's see i wrote yes i astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water "
11084,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so it me and student had some good ideas then how come we're in this class "
11086,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right "
11088,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so then mine is good "
11090,310.1,Chris,,,"i don't have to change mine either "
11092,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay i'm still confused "
11094,310.1,Farrah,,,"i had a different answer from from them but if they're all right then the my answers right too "
11097,310.1,Farrah,,,"i said no not for a long time "
11099,310.1,Farrah,,,"because the story says that it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money um and they'd have to build new equipment and do you think this will be a good investment so i said no "
11103,310.1,Farrah,,,"i mean yeah that makes that makes sense what the said exactly "
11105,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i i said it wasn't ready yet so i said no too "
11111,310.1,Chris,,,"You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
11113,310.1,Chris,,,"right it's all so maybe they if they have a base then they could have water there "
11116,310.1,Oliver,,,"so that we all did really well i thought that i thought that i'm wrong since you said that they were right okay "
11118,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call but i wanted to say thanks for asking asking class about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea so you know i felt valued "
11120,310.1,Oliver,,,"thanks okay bye bye okay "
11123,310.1,Luis,,,"i feel good i'm excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11127,310.1,Luis,,"but I do love that you brought your outside knowledge into the conversation. ","yeah "
11133,310.1,Farrah,,,"thanks to "
11138,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i mean i just happen to have the same answer as it wasn't i didn't i didn't copy offer anything extra she said horse first i'm sorry i was like oh well that's the same thing i found in a story to "
11144,420.2,Oliver,,"understand maybe next time if you have the same idea someone you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up ","hi i'm so on while i'm looking it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on i mean i guess are you saying that i should i shut off i could say but sometimes above that one to the waters founders microscopic "
11147,420.2,Jazmin,,"you could say that to like you can bring an example of ","I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
11155,420.2,Jazmin,,"i would have loved if you just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does just said what the machine was or just talked more about what the machine does ","okay "
11158,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess i'm just thinking okay so then what what are the words that i was supposed to add like i'm masses i should put the whole sentence matheson to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11164,420.2,Jazmin,,"They use it so that they can see what's going on on the moon that might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple like nasa said the lunar orbiter to investigate ","i think so i think i think you're saying that um but i should say more stuff um but my my answer is too short and i needed to say more more stuff like that "
11166,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah like we should fill in the blanks just to make our sentence a little meteor ","okay i guess "
11170,420.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment mike oxygen tanks masks and suits to "
11174,420.3,Chris,,"we're looking for what's actually mentioned in the text like the microscope or the lunar orbiter so you can talk about your background knowledge just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way i know that you understand what we're talking about ","was my answer right "
11181,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay well i'm oh sorry student i just looked at four o'clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for giving us specific suggestions and hopeful ideas on how each of us can improve our answers okay "
11184,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11186,420.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah okay i guess that's fine okay "
11190,420.3,Jazmin,,,"the teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now "
11192,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah we put them down on our tablets to you "
11195,420.3,Jazmin,,,"do you want to hear mine "
11198,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay i said that nasa a small machine "
11202,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh the lunar obiter Okay. I can do that. "
11204,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh well i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11206,420.3,Farrah,,,"i said you need a scientific microscope to look really closely "
11209,420.3,Farrah,,,"you yeah to look at really small thing "
11212,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry teacher but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers "
11214,420.3,Oliver,,,"i circled the same thing with student so i guess i am right too "
11217,420.3,Oliver,,,"well i noticed that he said the water that they follow those microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it "
11220,420.3,Oliver,,,"It can you say that again you're talking kind of fast. "
11224,420.2,Oliver,,"you can always write that even scientists use a microscope ","Okay, I got it now. "
11226,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i was just i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
11229,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah so they use on a breathe because while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces "
11232,420.2,Luis,,,"actually i wrote about the oxygen tanks too because that equipment and the question as our equipment and so i said you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank "
11234,420.2,Luis,,,"so i'm right too it could be oxygen tanks or microscopes or lunar orbiter "
11238,420.2,Oliver,,,"i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye "
11240,420.2,All,,,"high "
11242,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11246,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i also know about space as i went to nasa with my dad "
11250,420.2,Luis,,,"i think the most important equipment was the microscope "
11253,420.2,Luis,,,"i've got my tone "
11258,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh i don't remember what i said in the text but that was kind of my answer so i don't have to say my my answers wrong "
11264,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i just want you to go a little further in your explanation and use some evidence from what you read about ","i have to i have to write more stuff in my answer "
11266,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff ","okay "
11268,420.2,Luis,,,"a hack "
11273,420.2,Luis,,,"Um, yeah i mean we're we're reading about the mon and so i i wrote about em and an astronaut equipment and so i'm like well this is some equipment i know they need on the moon "
11276,410.3,Luis,,"but in your answer i also would have liked to see you mention the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon ","yeah i guess so "
11279,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer "
11284,420.2,Chris,,"but when you're answering the discussion questions for the text that we read just try and incorporate something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks does that make sense ","yeah i think you're saying like okay i gotta i gotta use more more stuff in the text and use what i already know "
11288,510.1,Oliver,,"yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for class not just student so when you're answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading ","yeah yeah i felt like i did that you know i mean i looked at the question and the question asked about equipment and and asked about like what equipment that they use to discover water and so when i was walking in the in the story and i saw that on microsoft is equipment and we're using a microscope to look at the water so i felt like i get all the right thing i don't know why white minus wrong "
11296,410.3,Oliver,,"uh huh yeah and they definitely do need to use a microscope but the big idea of the story is the lunar orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon uh huh yeah and they definitely do need to use a microscope but the big idea of the story is the lunar orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon but i also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part ","i'm a big idea not just one part okay okay well i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but um i i do appreciate that you helped us all kind of look more at the text to try to use more evidence and our answer so thanks for that okay bye "
11299,410.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11305,310.1,Farrah,,"for our first question you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and i wanted to say that that was really good and that i liked that you used the specific name of the tool that scientists used ","well i thought that was the correct tool because it says in the third paragraph that they used it to look really closely at the water and the question is asking about looking at water "
11308,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay let me see sorry my my tablets not loading oh give me a second "
11312,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay okay so you said the second paragraph "
11314,310.1,Farrah,,,"nasa sent a small machine to the moon to investigate "
11320,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11323,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct but i want you to elaborate a little bit more so yes nasa sent a small machine but what was that small machine called ","i guess it was what student just read right the lunar orbiter "
11326,420.2,Jazmin,,"right so when we use the term lunar orbiter we're using evidence to support our response and so that's something you want to make sure you're doing because it shows that ","yeah it makes sense to use that i have to use it okay "
11328,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah sure "
11335,420.2,Chris,,,"and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah "
11343,420.2,Chris,,"he already knows a lot about space and he learned the astronauts use these specific things so that's great to keep in mind when you're reading the text. but you also want to make sure that when you're answering the question you're specifically using evidence and examples that the text gives you so it's awesome to make connections with your background knowledge but in order to answer a question you want to make sure that it comes from the text ","yeah yeah yeah okay but my question did come from the text i mean my answer did "
11349,420.2,Chris,,"however again when you look at that question it asks what equipment found those craters of water so that would be similar to student where you just want to make sure that you're using a specific piece of evidence to support what you said when you said that there's craters of water ","i mean i guess i can see it for student because she just had to add more the specific name but they didn't say like the more specific name of the craters in the in the story "
11352,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay "
11356,420.2,Oliver,,,"correct "
11360,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok so when i was reading it and i'm in the last paragraph it says i'm making this plan will take a lot of time and money do you think about you decide and so i'm like well if it's gonna take a lot of time and i mean it's not ready yet "
11364,310.1,Oliver,,"right i definitely appreciate that you were able to find exactly where in the text you found your answer ","so why could it be yes i'm thinking "
11366,310.1,Luis,,,"okay um while he's thinking i got this figured out this time so now i'm all good "
11369,310.1,Luis,,,"okay because i i get it now that i'm supposed to like you know read the question and then read it and then find the evidence so yeah i think i'm good here "
11371,310.1,Luis,,,"straight from the text "
11375,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh okay oh okay all right while student is thinking um i had a similar answer to student and so i think i'm still kind of confused "
11378,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right "
11384,310.1,Farrah,,,"and so it said okay they would need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that sounds like it would take a lot of money which if it's not ready then it's not valuable right "
11389,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah. "
11391,420.1,Farrah,,"you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future. ","okay "
11394,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i think i didn't really look at that word could be so yeah that makes sense "
11396,420.1,Chris,,,"talking about the future i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
11398,420.1,Chris,,,"me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to nasa so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon and then what their plans are in the future "
11407,420.2,Chris,,"and what you could do with that so in your response you could have added something like in another article i read it said that there could be a base on the moon and then connect to the article we're reading now so do you have any idea of how you could do that ","okay okay so there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so then they won't have to carry the water in the ships anymore so how's that "
11409,420.2,Chris,,"pretty good i would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon ","yeah yeah yeah okay okay "
11411,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah yeah yeah i think "
11413,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well okay i think i did what what student and student didn't do is i answered the question i said yes and then i also did the thing where i i i pulled the evidence from the text so i guess i don't know why mine is wrong "
11419,420.2,Jazmin,,"that is a very good response and i like that you provided a use for the water that was evidence that you pulled from the text i would probably just expand your response so you could ","Okay yeah yeah yeah I have an idea. "
11423,420.2,Jazmin,,,"you want me to share now okay okay um so yes astronauts could drink the water and because it's heavy they won't have to carry it on the ship they can drink it from the moon "
11426,530.1,Jazmin,,"how did your thinking change there what did you do differently ","well i i use two sentences i use my sentence and then kind of student sentence and then i set it up because in there too "
11429,530.1,Farrah,,,"well it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say i appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers yeah me too bye bye "
11431,530.1,Luis,,,"hi "
11433,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11436,530.1,Farrah,,,"uh-huh yeah i have it on my tablet right here yeah it's on our tablets on our desk "
11441,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah the equipment was the microscope "
11444,530.1,Jazmin,,,"oh but miss teacher i didn't have the microscope i said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two "
11448,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um i mean i think so but i okay i'm going to listen more and then i'll see if i have a question "
11454,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um "
11457,530.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i still don't understand why my answer is wrong because i i looked in paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11460,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um ok "
11465,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um i mean i i did read the third paragraph but i didn't think that the microscope was the right answer because it said it said you that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it is that you would need a scientific tool so that means you would need a microscope to look really closely but it doesn't say that they had a microscope to look really closely and so that's why i thought it was the lunar orbiter in paragraph two because they said that that was that they sent that to look for the ice in the craters "
11468,530.1,Chris,,,"it's not so much confused but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11472,530.1,Luis,,,"okay well i don't know why mine was wrong because i mean i know i know a lot about space and so i know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon they can't breathe "
11474,530.1,Luis,,,"umm huh "
11477,530.1,Luis,,,"okay okay yeah "
11479,530.1,Luis,,,"um cuz yeah well i mean yeah cuz well when you said okay you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe so yeah yeah okay "
11482,530.1,Oliver,,,"well i mean i i circled the same thing as student um so i guess i mean i don't know why i'm in this class if we're right then what's wrong with with my answer "
11485,430.2,Oliver,,"you just um didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own you just said you circled the same thing as student so i really wanted to hear in your own thoughts not in farrah's thoughts um what you found in the passage and how you did it ","oh ok ok well yeah i mean i just found i read the whole thing and then in the last sentence of the last paragraph i saw where they said a scientific tool called a microscope so i was like okay yeah that's that's equipment and we use that equipment in science class and they're looking at the water "
11489,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay okay okay miss teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it's what's a short time and we just met but i i did appreciate how you you helped all of us kind of talk about and ask questions from you and i heard how you told student that his answer was cool but it didn't come from the question and so i'm going to think about that when we go to lunch "
11492,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11495,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay i said ah scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
11498,430.2,Luis,,,"um well i mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks you know "
11502,430.2,Jazmin,,,"um my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
11506,430.2,Jazmin,,,"um nasa since a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok it investigated "
11509,430.2,Jazmin,,,"um it investigated um the lunar orbiter um to investigate to look for ice deposits "
11511,430.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah yeah "
11513,430.2,Jazmin,,,"oh i did it that was the right answer i did it "
11515,430.2,Jazmin,,,"student okay go me "
11518,430.2,Chris,,,"uh huh okay so i said or something different i said umm that scientists found craters full water on the moon "
11522,430.2,Chris,,,"what equipment did they use oh it's what student just said "
11526,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh well i i i had some equipment but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11530,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but if jazmin's right and she has a different answer than me um i don't know why why is mine wrong "
11534,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh no i can see it um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon well i mean it says that they look at the water with a microscope that's equipment um "
11536,430.2,Farrah,,,"because the water was really small "
11541,430.2,Oliver,,,"um okay well i i had the same answer as student cuz i i said the thing the same thing about how they went um so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz cuz okay well that's the only that's the only paragraph that says says water and has an equipment in it "
11544,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa so i know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11548,430.2,Chris,,,"oh no no um ok so the only things that i saw was the microscope that student and student said and the lunar orbiter that student said so i don't know which one is the right "
11551,430.2,Chris,,,"okay so i said that they found a lot of water in the craters yeah "
11555,430.2,Chris,,,"you can't really find water using the microscope it's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope yeah "
11558,430.2,Chris,,,"well how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope "
11561,430.2,Jazmin,,,"Well, that's why I thought that maybe my answer was the right one. Because, um, cuz the the Lunar Orbiter, I think, that they sent to investigate. Um, I think maybe. "
11567,430.2,Oliver,,,"I'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. So I wanted to say goodbye and thanks for for for working with us you know um yeah that was kind of fun like i i see how we have to keep going back you kept saying okay go back to the text "
11574,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay it was in the last paragraph "
11577,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
11583,310.1,Oliver,,"and you were able to find that in the text good job ","well the question was asking about where they discovered the water and that was the only part where they had equipment and water and finding it so i looked for all the keywords and that's what's this the section of the story with the keywords "
11586,310.1,Jazmin,,,"teacher i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
11590,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay i see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two yeah I saw lunar orbiter. "
11592,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
11598,310.1,Oliver,,"great job pulling that out of the text ","ice ice is also water. "
11603,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon "
11608,310.1,Chris,,,"in the first paragraph i was looking for like the keywords like how student was saying you know and i'm looking for like finding water on the moon in this sentence had like a bunch of those words scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so that's got like all of the things about finding water on the moon "
11612,510.1,Chris,,"great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find your answer ","is the one that Oliver said. "
11616,510.1,Chris,,,"i do know that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11620,510.1,Chris,,,"use to like breathe or walk or you know to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool i guess they don't use them to find water "
11623,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for the next class "
11625,510.1,Oliver,,,"you're welcome bye "
11628,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i said nasa sent small machine "
11630,510.1,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
11635,510.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11637,510.1,Jazmin,,,"a lunar orbiter "
11643,510.1,Jazmin,,,"it looks i used to pause it in a large polar crater Okay well. i had always seen those two machines that the equipment was the microscope or that the machine the small machine called a lunar orbiter and i guess i was thinking about looking for ice deposits is the same as like trying to discover water cuz ice is just frozen water "
11648,510.1,Jazmin,,,"why why what's wrong with my answer then if i had the right answer "
11652,420.2,Farrah,,"well i just wanted you to be more specific and answer the full question you said that nasa used a small machine i wanted you to tell me what the machine was called and why it was used to find water on the moon okay okay so when you're answering so next time when we have questions make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can ","yeah i think there's still evidence in the text at the microscope "
11656,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay well i added like a longer answer than jazmin's one and i and i said the name of the equipment in mind so so why is mine wrong "
11661,420.2,Farrah,,,"how it's used to find water and it's not used to find water on the moon "
11664,420.2,Farrah,,"you explained to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does but i wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon ","oh so i have to add that to my to my answer "
11668,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so i know about space and i know that they can't breathe up in space and like student said you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use yeah yeah and i heard there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
11674,420.2,Luis,,,"wow okay i guess i guess they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to breathe air "
11676,420.2,Luis,,,"right "
11681,420.2,Luis,,,"if they're on the moon then i have to student you can't you can't be walking on the moon without an oxygen tank you can't breathe "
11684,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh okay teacher i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for kind of valuing all of us like i felt valued too and my answer and i'm thinking about what hearing what like i'm student needed to work on is kind of giving me an idea on how i can improve my answer to "
11687,420.2,All,,,"we are good "
11690,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah no problem um so basically i was just saying that like i kind of know like all about space so i don't think i really need to be in this "
11692,420.2,Luis,,,"well i can stick around "
11702,420.2,Chris,,"I think you maybe could have gone in more depth to it, but like as a start like is a very good start. Good job. Farrah. But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it. Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way. I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box. You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box. ","yeah what does that mean exactly "
11704,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i was just wondering what's wrong with my answer like i was trying to figure out why what i said was wrong "
11706,430.2,Jazmin,,"um well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying nasa send a small machine but um you could have talked about what that machine was and how it but um yeah so you weren't you weren't wrong oh it's just i'm a little too broad ","i need to say something specific because i i needed to be like a big it's a small machine and like what it's called or like what it does is that what i need to say "
11708,430.2,Jazmin,,,"no that makes sense so like i should just say like in detail like what it was "
11714,430.2,Luis,,,"Okay, well that that makes sense. Like so, like you say like more details. So like if I was gonna say equipment like I need to come up with like a few different pieces of it.Is that right? "
11717,430.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah i was just gonna say goodbye to nasa so with with my dad and i saw that they use like all kinds of equipment like shooting baskets oxygen tanks all that kind of stuff "
11721,430.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah absolutely so i saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship if they had to do like you know what i mean like a spot and you also saw that they had these really cool like they like the food that they eat is crazy like they eat this food they like so they like put water in and then it kind of comes out like like tires "
11724,430.2,Jazmin,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular they really wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from the text in our answers and like make sure that we didn't just like talking you know let me just say the thing that you had to back it up with evidence and also just wanted to thank you for like listening to our different interests and our stories because i think we were really interested in sharing our stories so thank you so much "
11730,430.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11745,420.2,Chris,,"To maybe not like bulk it up, but to add a little more background knowledge to it um was you could say why the water on the moon is important and how it can help. Pretty key to all this um. so um yeah just maybe next time just try think of like so yeah just maybe next time just try think of a reason why the thing that they found is important ","i was i was trying to think about the question because this the first question what equipment that scientists use to find water on the moon and i feel like i did answer it because i talked about where they found the water "
11750,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
11755,420.2,Jazmin,,"A suggestion I had written down when I looked at all the responses um I saw it, you could instead of saying NASA sent a small machine, you could say. so maybe like adding a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence ","so nasa to smell machine "
11760,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it was a long sentence but i wrote most of it "
11766,420.2,Chris,,"can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um. ","sorry you were talking about equipment i remember something so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11773,430.2,Luis,,"um you could just kind of expand more because you said use a lot of the equipment and then you only said oxygen tanks you can maybe mentioned like the soup thing where because that's also equipment because they needed to be up there on ","okay okay i can add a couple more names of equipment "
11775,430.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later "
11777,430.2,Oliver,,,"we'll see you later bye "
11779,430.2,Bennett,,,"okay i'm sending you in your chat "
11783,430.2,Luis,,,"yes i don't mean to interrupt you but i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
11785,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah i think i got all of this figured out so i'm all good now "
11788,430.2,Luis,,,"ok ok ok "
11790,430.2,Luis,,,"sorry "
11795,430.2,Farrah,,,"in the story at the end of the story they talked about how it would take a lot of time and money for the thing to be made and it said well do you think that'll be a worth while investment or something like that do you think there will be a good investment and so i'm thinking no it's going to take that long "
11800,310.1,Farrah,,"For your answer, which is really good so i'm keep Keep up the good job of looking at the evidence on before they even asked that question. You know, someone could have given like a shorter and simple answer, I guess, but your answer was still very good so good job on us man, thank you very much, no problem, no problem so i'm dead, you said. ","yeah i read it last story "
11802,420.2,Farrah,,"can you tell me in your own words why it's not ready using using what's in the passage but in your own words ","i'm okay okay so it says that they need to come up with a plan and making the plan that's going to take a lot of time and money and they have to build new equipment so it's that's not ready at all because that'll take a long time "
11804,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i'm still kind of confused "
11806,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well cuz you said that so the answer was a good answer but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and i wrote like a lot of words because you told us to expand our answers but they're different "
11825,310.1,Chris,,"i mean i as i said last time adding an extra sentence to it can only help it sometimes and never make it worse i like how you added evidence that you have to stay hydrated because you can't survive without water so i like how you paid attention to that and you paid a lot of attention to details um so i like how you paid attention to that and you're you paid a lot to attention you paid a lot of ","i think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more details to our writing yes yes what else i read that there could be a moon base or a base on the moon by 2024 "
11828,310.1,Chris,,,"i'd love to go to that place it would be real cool "
11834,420.2,Luis,,"Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen. ","okay well i know you can breathe oxygen and so maybe they could make like a breathing room or something and then hydrogen oh okay it says oxygen hydrogen can also be used as rocket fuel "
11838,420.2,Luis,,,"the story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel "
11841,420.2,Luis,,,"for you fuel which is what the as on student said that in 2024 they could have a gas station so being able to split up the hydrogen and oxygen efficiently would be very important so you can have the breathing room and then the gas station that's cool down for that "
11847,420.2,Oliver,,"um because again as i said adding extra sentences can go from making a sentence slightly like vague and not as detailed to something very detailed and ","well we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz i i like how you you explain what we needed to work on adding more details but also how you asked about our thinking that led to our answers because sometimes teacher just tell us what they think we were thinking about and you asked us what we were thinking about "
11852,420.2,Oliver,,,"bye "
11860,420.2,Luis,,,"okay so hi so we're going to go ahead and repeat our answers for you so you have all that okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close arm yeah and i circled basically the same thing as student um i my answer was scientists found craters water on the moon and basically what i said was i was saying that nasa send a small machine yeah and what i said basically was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know all kinds of stuff like that "
11866,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh that that's a good question so okay so my reasoning was basically that okay i agree that you need a scientific tool called a microscope like that's the equipment that the scientists use that the scientists you and i think that if you can't like okay they said in the reading that the a to where did they say it exactly they said that oh yeah okay in paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i know that you need a microscope to study the water "
11868,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like i i kind of already know like all about space and i don't really feel like i even need to be in this class "
11871,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i know all about it my dad's an astronaut "
11876,420.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you i was wondering like why my answer was like why my answer was right "
11878,420.2,Jazmin,,"it was right but i wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used ","so this small machine was called the lunar orbiter "
11880,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i think that makes a lot more sense thank you "
11884,420.2,Chris,,,"well i was just gonna say that i never like student sets up that way basically um you know scientists like well they basically like i went to nasa so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and master too so i was wondering like why that you know i mean like where does that fit in if it's not in the meeting but we know that they "
11886,420.2,Chris,,,"yo yeah yeah i love space "
11888,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah i know like all kinds of stuff about that and i like i really know about "
11891,420.2,Farrah,,,"it's just a few of us i don't think class like student and student are really obsessed with space and i think they're the ones that "
11894,420.2,Farrah,,,"i think space is fine but actually i really am interested in space but for me i like science fiction "
11901,420.2,Farrah,,"i wish your answers had a little bit more detail ","um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to use evidence from the text and like making sure that we were you were using that and then like the way when you were talking to student like you know you were basically able to like say to him like you know like what were you thinking like what was your thinking in your answer and i thought that was really cool i think you did something like that with student and that's really cool to be like asking them to think about like what you mean like what they were thinking about to thank you so much and it was really nice to meet you bye "
11904,420.2,Luis,,,"get so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to be in this class because i know that you're helping class who needed help because i already know all about space "
11906,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah "
11910,420.2,Farrah,,,"is it okay if i go first "
11912,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i said and we can just go around so i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close "
11914,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay "
11918,420.2,Oliver,,,"so my answer was that i circled the same as student "
11922,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay so here's what i thought was i was looking for equipment right because it said what equipment did the scientists use and i thought well microscope is a piece of equipment i thought that maybe like the lunar orbiter maybe it wasn't a piece of equipment because it's a machine so i was thinking equipment was more like a tool like a hammer or like a microscope "
11926,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah that's what i knew about equipment "
11928,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah "
11931,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess i was kind of confused about why my answer was wrong "
11938,410.1,Jazmin,,"If you read the question carefully, you would have noticed the keywords equipment scientist and discover you use the Lunar. ","was my answer is it is so i said nasa centers small machine but was that not quite the the answer small machine oh okay that makes sense so i gotta say like what exactly is okay that makes sense "
11940,410.1,Chris,,,"sure so my response was basically that scientists craters full water on the moon "
11944,410.1,Chris,,,"oh ok so my answer was right i just said that basically there was too much water okay "
11951,410.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah i'm okay yes so i was just thinking and wondering cuz my dad took me to nasa and when i was there i saw that scientists and astronauts us all kinds of like suits and oxygen tanks and equipment other kinds so i guess i was thinking like i guess what i was wondering was like didn't they need that did they leave that out of the reading because that seems really important "
11954,410.1,Chris,,,"gotcha Okay, thank you. "
11956,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so what i said was that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks mass and stuff kind of like what harris was saying "
11960,410.1,Luis,,,"gotcha so what's the background knowledge like is incorrect. "
11964,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm just gonna say unfortunately we have to go to my next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
11971,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so for me i would change my answer initially i said that like you know the the scientists use the small machine but i would make sure that i will use my evidence and say that completely answer so i would say nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find water on the moon is that right "
11977,410.1,Chris,,,"so i would change my answer what i would say as i would say like um so i said initially scientists craters on the water and i would say instead that scientists found craters with small pieces of ice in that on the moon "
11979,410.1,Luis,,,"and um so actually for me i was just gonna say that i think that i've got everything all figured out now so i was gonna say i think about good can i go back to my desk "
11987,410.1,Luis,,,"um so well i guess i would change my answer to um i don't know a machine so lunar orbiter. "
11990,410.1,Luis,,,"um i would say the lunar orbiter went to the moon "
11997,410.1,Oliver,,,"um okay so basically what i said okay so initially what i had said was that i circled the same as student student she has some really good ideas but also i thought the same thing as her which is that the microscope was the tool that they looked really closely and how they found the water and it sounds like there was the other things that they used to find the water and i'm still a little confused about if they use the microscope or if they use the space suits but it sounds like the answer to this question from our conversation is the lunar orbiter but i think that in the text it still says they use the microscope so it makes me think like put the microscope beyond like a second answer "
12001,410.2,Oliver,,"but the microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope ","gotcha so um I I read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024. do you think that they did that because they found water "
12006,410.2,Farrah,,,"yes so it seems like for me okay so originally i said that that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and what i meant by that when i was thinking about my answer like i meant that because it says in the in the text that the water is just like little microscopic ice crystals so i thought how can you find if you can see that so i guess the lunar orbiter like that that that makes sense that that's the machine at a sense and it was looking like maybe the lunar orbiter had a microscope on it like how could you find the microscopic water if you couldn't see it "
12019,410.2,Jazmin,,,"so actually fortunately it's time for us to the lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to help you for a while i wanted to thank you for helping us understand some of the misconceptions that we like you really helped us to understand like you know the meaning of the kind of words especially around discover like when you were saying like what we needed to focus on the question i think that was really like helpful because like words like discover yeah like i think class like thought that that was really helpful because it helps us to figure out like what to look for you know what i mean like it's not always obvious like what we should be looking for in you know in the thing so i think it really helped us to understand like the word we should look for and you also encouraged us to make sure that we use evidence so you know what i mean like we we couldn't give an answer that didn't have evidence from the text and i think that was really good practice for us to thank you so much "
12023,410.2,Farrah,,,"yes we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers awesome basically ok so my answer what do you want to give us to give it one by one or do you want to call on us how would you like "
12029,410.2,Luis,,,"sounds good okay you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close and i basically circle the same thing as student scientist scientists don't printers for water and i said a small machine and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks stuff like that "
12036,420.2,Farrah,,"i think you did a really great job pulling from the text but i also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response so maybe what you found from the text along with what you thought about it does that sound good ","yeah so like what my opinion on what i thought Okay I can do that. "
12039,420.2,Oliver,,"but like i said to her maybe personalize it a little bit add your own views sound good ","okay yeah "
12043,430.2,Chris,,"and then student so what you said related to the text really well you had some of your personal views along with some thoughts that came from the text so it was a great response but we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote so do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly ","reach every rader yeah i can totally do that "
12047,310.1,Jazmin,,"and student i think you had some great vocab ","actually my my answer was well "
12050,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i was just trying to figure out like why my answer was wrong "
12055,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah basically i saw that in paragraph two nasa send a small machine or better to investigate "
12059,310.1,Luis,,,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that like i already know all about space like i don't think i need any help "
12061,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
12063,310.1,Chris,,,"oh i was just gonna say i know because i've been to nasa that up you know scientists like us a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks stuff like that you know what i mean "
12067,420.2,Jazmin,,"thank you so student like we were saying i think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond okay ","okay "
12071,420.3,Luis,,"but in this particular text we're learning about one specific thing so maybe next time if we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion we'd have a stronger response is that okay ","um yeah i guess i'm trying to figure out which the thing is because there's so many pieces that go into the spaceship you know so i'm i'm trying to figure out like which one it is "
12074,420.3,Luis,,,"Yeah, okay. "
12077,420.3,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately it's time much so we have to go but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular i really wanted to thank you for drawing our attention to you know to me and asking us to share our thoughts like i was really glad to be able to share my thoughts out so thank you so much for working "
12082,420.3,Oliver,,,"what you'd like us to say them or or do you remember that "
12085,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space "
12087,420.3,Luis,,,"no not yet but i will "
12093,420.3,Luis,,,"um so i didn't really need to read it because i already knew the answer because i know a lot about space so i knew already that that scientists had to use that "
12098,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so basically what i was thinking that it was in the second paragraph and they were talking about the end of the machine "
12101,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand "
12104,420.2,Jazmin,,"your answer is not necessarily wrong i just think we could expand on it further so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now ","well it says that its looking for ice sheets is that what it's supposed to be "
12110,430.2,Jazmin,,"adding more information would make your answer a little bit more what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more on task what's the word i'm looking for specific and a little bit more you know on task what you said is good but it's a little it's a wide range for an answer so this kind of pinpoints more so if you were to be a little bit more specific so that's a great answer but next time just try to lead read a little bit further just for a little bit more information okay ","oh ok so i saw that i'm excited the first paragraph it they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water you know "
12113,430.2,Jazmin,,,"oh well that's where they discovered the water "
12119,410.1,Oliver,,"that is true that is where they discovered the water but the question was the equipment that they used we're talking about the equipment so you did name where we found it but the question is more focused on the equipment ","student is usually right and i also thought that too "
12124,410.1,Farrah,,,"so i was looking for and the only equipment that i could find it pretty three paragraphs with me and i thought it was a like you know how are our test as like the kind of trick questions and it says what and you have to find that exact i was like what and i thought oh the bikers right so even though i wasn't quite sure about like how it works i figured the microscope had to be "
12128,310.1,Chris,,"i liked that you looked through multiple paragraphs to find that answer ","um i i actually saw like a spaceship one time "
12133,520.1,Farrah,,"so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make your answer better ","unfortunately we have to go too much but thank you so much for people it was really fun thank you so much bye "
12137,520.1,Luis,,,"oh well i just was off i was gonna say that like i think i got everything figured out now so i think i'm all good to go "
12141,520.1,Luis,,,"okay "
12146,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i use it sure cuz when i think of equipment i just think of like a wrench or hamper you know like that equipment right so a microscope like maybe like fancy equipment but it still don't see any other equipment you know look that up "
12150,520.1,Farrah,,,"Oh. like a robot "
12154,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh no no sorry i was thinking about like what would be like oh so the lunar orbiter is like you would use and i guess they had a robot but no they just use the lunar orbiter "
12159,520.1,,,,"i think samantha's right "
12162,520.1,,,,"um well i think it was next to the robot part "
12166,520.1,,,,"yeah okay i see it "
12172,520.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess it's just what is the leader is that like you that's equipment like it too "
12177,520.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
12184,520.1,Oliver,,,"okay so when i was looking at it you know more seriously i saw that that they had like that they were using the microscope to look at the release small like particles of water and so that's kind of like why i thought that might have been cool as well and then i actually do understand like how student was say like that the lunar orbiter is also a piece of equipment because just like semana like i only saw the microscope i didn't think that the lunar orbiter was really like equipment the same way that like you know she was saying you know like a screwdriver or like you know something like that seems different so i kind of had the same thing she did "
12186,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah i guess so i i think like i read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know like i don't know like it made me think that this is something that could make that possible "
12192,420.3,Luis,,"Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me. ","oh i maybe i kind of feel like i don't know i feel like the stuff well i kind of feel like i don't really understand why they wouldn't like if they have all those astronauts they would have to use oxygen so i think my answer was still pretty right "
12198,420.3,Oliver,,"but your answer doesn't reflect on our text and the main point here is that we're trying to find in the text what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them to help you better understand the text ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for really hoping to sort of value the answers that we had and then like helping a lot of us sort of work through like our fusion and like also you really had us focus on using evidence which was pretty cool because that made sure that we were able to tell you like why we thought what we were thinking and like why we had our answer which was pretty cool so thank you so much it was really fun "
12202,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12221,420.3,Jazmin,,"But you use great academic knowledge.nd great academic vocab in your response. so that was good but next time i want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water ","okay i guess i thought that what i wrote i was what they used to discover the water Okay, I'm looking. the water they found was microscopic The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely. NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater. these ice deposits are very small scientists said the one top of the top layer of the surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one one person might drink in a day I'll let me read it again. teacher i think my answer from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
12226,420.2,Jazmin,,"you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use or the equipment they use so you noticed that it was a small machine which was very good and which was also stated in the text it shows that you used your context from the text which is very good you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use but so far so good ","okay okay "
12229,420.2,Farrah,,,"is i guess the one that student said the nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
12231,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i mean i see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater but i guess i didn't i didn't it doesn't look like they found water in there "
12236,420.2,Oliver,,"student you realized that student had a good answer and you agreed with her but next time i would like you to either add on to something she says based on the text or you can make up your own answer so you're adding on to the discussion or adding your own opinion to it so you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it ","but but i mean i had the same answer you just asked her how first so when it was my turn it was just the same thing "
12240,420.2,Oliver,,"for next time i would just like you to add on so you see how she said they use a microscope to look closer at the water you could have added on to say if you saw another equipment in the text or if you disagree or anything just add on to the discussion so we're not all saying the same things Or if  you disagree or anything. Just adding on to the discussion. So we're not all saying the same things. ","okay "
12242,420.2,Chris,,,"went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12251,420.3,Oliver,,"It was talking about how they didn't find a lot of water that they had to use a microscope to like look at the water that they did find so for next time. I just want you to read closer and if you don't understand the first time just reread as much as you need, or ask a pair or a teacher. but you used great academic vocab in your response next time i just want you to get a closer look into the text and think deeper about the question ","okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch but and i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think about how i should kind of give my own ideas i mean it's not like i copied off student but maybe you how i always want to add on a new idea or more more things if somebody else has the same idea as me "
12255,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm gap so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to even be in this room because i already know all about space and all this kind of stuff ready "
12263,420.3,Farrah,,,"So, like how they found even I mean like today yeah cuz I thought the. the microscope you through the microscope really close "
12265,420.2,Farrah,,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response. ","okay "
12269,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well i guess what i was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because i was thinking like if you're gonna see the water like the ice crystals they're really small and so i was thinking like that's the only way to see that "
12277,430.2,Jazmin,,"So I see where you agreed with Farrah. My suggestion would be to Either if you're gonna if you're gonna agree, I need you to add something was almost there but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra ","like like i guess i wasn't sure in this class you're helping us because we weren't quite right it is still kind of confused like why my answer was wrong "
12279,420.2,Jazmin,,"it actually wasn't wrong and i see where you answered your question i just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start and you were almost there you just needed to name the equipment so you you were on the right track ","i know the equipment can i say it "
12281,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so the small machine it was the lunar oriber right "
12284,420.2,Jazmin,,"yes that is correct so you just needed you were on the right track you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response make sure you're as specific as possible but you had a great start ","in that makes sense that it was like i just tend to be more specific like see what it what "
12286,420.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you that makes a lot of sense "
12290,420.2,Chris,,,"so i was also going to say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that "
12295,420.3,Chris,,"and for your response Chris, I would just like to ask you to just look a little closer into second paragraph. To see the exact equipment they used. ","gotcha okay yeah I can look close. "
12305,420.2,Chris,,"I just want you to look into it and find the evidence to support your answer. ","okay yeah i can look more closely and see what what else is going on because yeah i was just connecting to what i already do but i think i see what you're saying like i need to i need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well right now ok cool thank you "
12307,420.2,Luis,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you "
12312,520.1,Luis,,"ok so now that i have given you class some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed and how you will apply what you learned in your next task so i'm gonna give you class a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question ","um well i was gonna say i'm excited to share because i think i got it all figured out so i'm all good "
12319,510.1,Luis,,"What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question. ","so i thought like i was thinking about what you were saying and you were telling me like i needed to look more closely at the reading and not just not just use my background knowledge so you know like it was an interesting question you know like what equipment do they use and so i was saying like oh they use like oxygen tanks and stuff which i do but then when i look at paragraph two i realized that the equipment maybe that they were really focused on was the lunar orbit and and then in paragraph three was the microscope so it looks like maybe i can read more closely in the um you know what i mean like in the reading to understand like what i'm trying to answer "
12323,520.1,Jazmin,,"we're just going to go around student what do you think first you're going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for your next assignment or task ","so for me what i noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete so like what i needed to do was make sure that well a that i was like saying like you know not just this small machine but like what this machine was and if i didn't say that theni didn't really answer the question because they were asking like what equipment and i just said small machine i didn't say like lunar orbiter you know what i mean "
12326,420.2,Jazmin,,"exactly great observation and another thing is if anything you can always use direct evidence from the text to answer your question as long as you use the quotation mark for the evidence but good job yeah exactly ","can i ask a quick question "
12329,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so i guess i was partially still a little confused only on one section and so i understand why this woman she like the lunar orbiter was what they used to discover the water and i was wondering like if they use the microscope as well you know like student and oliver's answer like it seems like that might be an answer and i guess i was confused like why that might not be the right answer "
12332,420.2,Jazmin,,,"makes perfect sense thank you so much okay that makes sense i'm not confused "
12336,420.2,Chris,,,"um i think for me like what i noticed is like kind of similar to like i i bring a lot of my like background knowledge because i know all about this stuff but i wasn't reading as closely about the question because i was saying like you're saying this craters full of water moon and they use oxygen tanks and stuff like that but they didn't i didn't say really the answer i said like that they found the craters and then they use this other stuff but i didn't really say like what it meant that they fought with just what you've been pointing out to class so i think that that's why my answer was incomplete "
12342,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm so actually i understood a lot so i was thinking about it and then when you were talking to student and jasper it really made me think that like i'm i understand now that like when i said that they use the microscope just like the statement survey and i said i realized that they did use it but first they had to find it so i didn't read the question as closely as i could but what you pointed out was that i needed to read it closely and understand what they were asking "
12349,420.2,Oliver,,,"so i i read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024 and it was just making me think like the questions always make me think of other things so i was wondering like when when should i bring in that like that knowledge and question like you know what i mean like because that seems like that would use a lot of equipment but i guess i guess it's not answering the question is that right "
12352,420.1,Oliver,,"But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely. ","Okay. "
12360,520.1,Farrah,,"and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future ","so i started by saying that it was the microscope that they found the water with because i was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it they couldn't find it but when i read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water then they studied it using the microphone so that's that's pretty cool and where it makes me think like going forward is that i need to think really closely about what it's asking because sometimes like when we take our our leap test it always is hard for me to know like some of the tricky answers like they asked like what's the best answer and i think i'm understanding that there's like you can still see an answer and it still is connected but like what's the best answer and it seems like the best answer was the lunar orbiter like you were saying the student because that's the best answer that says like how did they find it like maybe they proved it with the microscope and they sort of found it but like what did they do to even find that it was there like they didn't have a microscope like i thought there was an astronaut but with a magnifying glass on the moon but that's not at all what it was like they had a little machine so i think what i would do is read really closely and try to understand like what what they're asking "
12366,520.1,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for a couple things that are really important in this class so like one thing that was really important as you help us understand our use evidence better so you really helped us to use evidence like in our answers so that we weren't just using background knowledge and also you have this there you know by by asking us what we were thinking that led to our answers you helped us understand like what we were doing right and maybe what we could do better and you also were so patient you let us explain our ideas and like you didn't interrupt this what we were trying to to understand and that made us feel really valued right class "
12371,520.1,Farrah,,,"i felt really valued so i just wanted to share that that was something that up and then finally you also like give us your concerns so you let us know like exactly what we could work on which helped us because rather than saying like oh you need to just work on your answer you were like we think about like what you're saying think about what's be asked and then give your answer so that like helped us to have a much better set of answers thank you so much that was really fun working with you "
12373,520.1,Luis,,,"i'm good "
12376,520.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12378,520.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah yeah ok "
12385,520.1,Farrah,,,"yeah we talked about we use a microscope in science class "
12394,420.2,Jazmin,,"okay so one thing is we need to make sure that we are answering the question fully so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon so what you want to say in your response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment ","well i don't understand why my answers wrong because i did use one of the equipment "
12398,430.2,Jazmin,,"you did you said i remember your response you said that nasa sent a small machine which is good that you mentioned nasa but you said small machine and we want to be a little bit more specific we want to be specific on our answer and pulling things from the text ","so after i have to write more stuff "
12408,430.2,Oliver,,"You said that scientists use a lot of equipment which is good. You, you talked about how they use equipment. But you said that they use oxygen tanks and oxygen tanks were not mentioned in the text. so if you class are having trouble thinking of an answer you know that you can go back to the text and look at the text and i don't want you to just say that you have the same answer even if your answer is going to be the same as the person next to you i still want you to say an answer because i want class to be giving an answer ","okay it does it was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and i circled the last sentence too "
12410,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay "
12417,420.2,Farrah,,"tool a microscope to look really closely that's a good response but we just need to add a little bit more talking about and being specific you want to say that they used it to find the water because the whole purpose of the text is finding water on the moon we want to be using that good language and good vocabulary that we're learning from the text ","So, i guess kind of like student i have to add more words "
12420,420.2,Farrah,,,"or i have to change my answer "
12422,420.2,Chris,,"You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text. ","reach every readers i went to nasa "
12426,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah with my dad i went to nasa so i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah they they they need a lot of equipment to go to the moon "
12436,410.1,Oliver,,"But you didn't talk about the equipment. the question asked for you to talk about the equipment ","um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really do appreciate how you helped us to think about using more evidence from the text in our answers bye "
12442,410.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about space "
12459,410.3,Jazmin,,"so for the three of you student student and student when you go back and read i want you to go back and reread the passage with the question in mind Farrah you mentioned a microscope which is mentioned in the passage which is good, you just need to reread the question again and take it a step farther because i'm concerned that you didn't fully understand what the question was asking. so i want you to go back and reread and be more specific because we want specific answers you didn't mention what type of machine you just wrote a small machine and that's not very specific and student you said that the scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks so oxygen tanks weren't mentioned in the passage ","excuse me teacher i was looking and i still don't understand why my answer's wrong "
12472,420.2,Chris,,"you're right about that but it's not specific so rereading the question asking what equipment was used to discover water i want you to keep that question in mind and reread the passage to rework your answer so i want you to reread the question because i don't think you fully understood what the question was asking so i want you to reread the question because i don't think you fully understood what the question was asking because your answer didn't have anything to do with equipment it just said that water was found on the moon so it's good to reread the question and go back to find those words to help you get the answer that you need and as i talked to student she said microscope which was mentioned in the passage but for you my concern is that you didn't have really your own answer you just said that yours was the same as student so i would love if you go back reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because i want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12474,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
12477,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay well you told me that i have to be more specific so i have nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
12482,420.2,Oliver,,,"sorry to interrupt i was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later "
12491,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i think i got it now and i'm all good yeah "
12494,420.2,Luis,,,"ok "
12501,420.2,Farrah,,,"it's like facts "
12504,420.2,Chris,,,"valuable means like has a lot of value "
12506,420.2,Luis,,,"like it's worth a lot of money like money "
12512,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i think i did that so i don't know why my answers wrong "
12524,310.1,Chris,,"but i just want you to go back and look for more specific evidence because there is more stuff where you can be super super specific so reread the question and go back into the passage to find more specific evidence so you had said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen you are right that is from the passage so you did get that from the passage which is good ","I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
12527,310.1,Chris,,,"no no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to nasa and i read that maybe they could put some a base up there so it'll make things easier "
12529,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah "
12538,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go but i was listening to what you're telling class else and i think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer yeah I think I think I know that that's what I need to do. "
12542,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12545,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sure ok so i circle the last sentence in the text you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
12548,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does "
12550,310.1,Oliver,,,"the machine is the lunar orbiter "
12552,310.1,Chris,,,"in that paragraph two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
12554,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah because a machine is equipment "
12556,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
12558,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ok "
12560,310.1,Luis,,,"so i feel like the answer is lunar orbiter "
12562,310.1,Luis,,,"ok so it says that nasa's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit well i mean and you told us to look at this paragraph so "
12564,310.1,Luis,,,"it investigates "
12568,310.1,Farrah,,,"lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits in a large polar Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah, because ice is just frozen water. "
12571,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i wasn't thinking about that i was just looking for the word water and i didn't even think about the fact that oh yeah like you said today and ice and water is the same "
12575,420.2,Luis,,"So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine. But what does it do? To answer the question in context. ","it look and looks for ice deposits Frozen-- frozen water. Yeah, frozen water. "
12577,420.2,Luis,,,"ok so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit "
12579,420.2,Luis,,,"and ice deposits are frozen water "
12581,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah yeah "
12583,420.2,Chris,,,"i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and "
12590,420.2,Farrah,,,"i'll try ok so the lunar orbiter sends the lunar orbiter OK. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter-- OK, OK, OK. OK. The lunar orbiter-- the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits. "
12592,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok "
12594,420.2,Farrah,,,"they're very small oh ice ice deposits are frozen water "
12597,420.2,Farrah,,,"to find them to investigate to investigate "
12601,420.2,Oliver,,,"the ice deposits I don't have any questions but I did look at the clock and I see that it's time for us to go to lunch. "
12603,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh you're welcome i wanted to say thank you for really helping me to think more about how to find more evidence in the story to put in my answer so thank you for that "
12611,420.1,Jazmin,,"now before you share the answers with the class i want you to independently for one minute circle keywords or words that you think are important in the question i want you to circle them and then i want you in one minute to share back with me what you circled ","yeah "
12613,420.1,Farrah,,,"i circled equipment and water "
12616,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i circled water and moon i circled equipment "
12624,420.1,Luis,,,"because it's an action word What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space. "
12630,420.3,Oliver,,"so we're going to look at the reading and the first part and i want you to circle again independently equipment that you see listed in the reading ","i circled ah microscope "
12632,420.3,Farrah,,,"i circle microscope too so i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
12636,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i circled two i circled small machine and lunar orbiter "
12638,420.3,Luis,,,"i'll read it i'll read it ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
12642,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh maybe like ice that gets put down somewhere "
12647,420.3,Farrah,,,"ice is frozen water "
12652,420.3,Chris,,,"well i'm sorry to interrupt but it just made me think of something yeah so i went to nasa and so i saw that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and mask and suits "
12665,420.3,Jazmin,,,"Okay um so. i have a lunar orbiter as my answer okay yeah i didn't have that one i'll look at all the paragraph three again the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay so that's pretty much easy you know you use a microscope to look really closely okay and then for the lunar orbiter thing it says the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposits so they're both looking for things okay and well it says that the lunar orbiter okay so they both look for things and it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and the microscope looks really closely at water i mean i guess that's different except it's also the same "
12672,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so okay love to finish later "
12678,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12683,420.1,Farrah,,"so looking back at the first question i want you to independently for one minute i want you to circle any keywords or important words that you see in the question that you think are important i want to do that for one minute and then come back ","i circled equipment and water "
12685,420.1,Oliver,,,"i circled the same thing i circled equipment and water "
12688,420.1,Jazmin,,,"well okay i guess it's the same thing i circled equipment "
12690,420.1,Luis,,,"i circled equipment and the moon "
12692,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i forgot i thought that i only circled equipment but i actually circled equipment and scientists "
12701,420.3,Jazmin,,"and i want you to circle any important equipment that you see in the reading ","okay um so the first one that i see is the small machine teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
12720,420.3,Chris,,,"ok all what do you see ok well student i see a small machine that's equipment okay i'll circle that one ok class i'm going to circle small machine like student said they've got microscope in here that's equipment okay i'll circle that too reach every reader okay we're done yeah well, I mean, I think that microscope is like small. well a small machine could be small too ok then they're the same well they could be the same they could be the same Well, no, it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter. It said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits. you know what teacher i was i went to nasa and i know that scientists used a whole bunch of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12722,410.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear. We're looking at when they used to find the water. ","ice is frozen water "
12726,410.1,Oliver,,,"they're really small Oh, they're water. They're water. "
12729,410.1,Luis,,,"we use the microscope you know to look at really small things in science class "
12732,410.1,Farrah,,,"i wrote this one in my answer they're using the microscope to look really closely at the water "
12735,410.1,Oliver,,,"they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water "
12738,410.1,Oliver,,,"scientists used the lunar orbiter to find water on the moon "
12743,410.1,Oliver,,,"no no and i i was i just want to say aw thanks teacher it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to thank you for when you when you kind of helped us keep looking at the story and thinking about what the meanings of the words are i think that kind of helped me to think about the answer okay bye "
12746,410.1,Luis,,,"yes excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12748,410.1,Luis,,,"okay "
12750,410.1,Luis,,,"i guess "
12753,410.1,Luis,,,"um maybe i think "
12755,410.1,Farrah,,,"no i don't like "
12761,410.2,Farrah,,"one part you were missing though is what they were looking at what they were looking at so what were they looking at closely ","water "
12763,420.2,Farrah,,"Could really just push through your answer. That makes sense. ","so i just got to add at the water all my all my sentence "
12767,420.2,Farrah,,"just make sure when you're writing answers like this you need to be very clear about the what and the why so you had part of the what you just needed the second piece ","okay "
12769,420.2,Oliver,,,"uh huh "
12771,420.2,Oliver,,,"when she read her answer she had circled the last sentence i'm an animal story and i i circled the last sentence and the story to "
12777,420.2,Oliver,,,"on cars well though the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for like an equipment and and i saw the microscope and i know that that's equipment of course we use it in science class Um, well, I think I understand that. i think so "
12779,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh "
12783,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my my answers wrong "
12787,420.2,Jazmin,,"it's just we need more specifics right so when we're answering questions like this you need to have the specifics you don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read ","oh yeah "
12791,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um i guess i don't know what more just write more words "
12797,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter "
12803,420.2,Jazmin,,,"deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater "
12818,420.2,Jazmin,,"right so when we're answering questions like this you need to have the specifics you don't necessarily have to take the whole paragraph you read so student when you're looking at these answers you need to be able to look at the what they're asking for so you got the equipment next time just make sure if it has a name include the name look at the what they're asking for so you got that you got you got the equipment ","just at the name You say, i need more details Okay, okay. "
12820,420.2,Chris,,,"no problem i just wanted to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of other stuff to "
12825,420.2,Chris,,,"I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter. "
12827,420.2,Chris,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
12832,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt i'm teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it was a really short time but i did appreciate how are you you asked us to a look more at the text to add more evidence from the text tool to our answers thank you for that "
12834,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
12838,420.2,Farrah,,,"yes okay can you hear us "
12840,420.2,Farrah,,,"great we're excited to work with you today "
12843,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i should be and best class i already know all about space "
12846,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah sounds good "
12851,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i said nasa centers small machine "
12853,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i said because there's a sentence at the beginning of part two that says that "
12858,420.2,Jazmin,,"and that was great to use the reading to help us with our answer awesome so i see what you did but we need to be a little more detailed ","they needed it to investigate the craters "
12861,420.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah so i sent a microscope that was my answer um so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
12866,430.2,Farrah,,"but we it's not complete so there's a little bit more that we need to add to your answer to make it complete you're almost there but we just need to make it a little bit big we need to make it a little bit more detail ","yeah i just don't know what to add "
12868,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
12872,310.1,Jazmin,,"awesome so that's what it says in the text which is great that we used our resources ","they sent the small machine "
12874,310.1,Luis,,,"i know "
12876,310.1,Luis,,,"lunar orbiter "
12879,310.1,Luis,,,"no it's too small "
12886,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'll try okay um so for the equipment the scientists used the machine called the lunar orbiter and a microscope "
12890,310.1,Chris,,,"well so i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12893,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry yeah i mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope but i also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks so i think chris's right "
12895,310.1,Luis,,,"so we could say like all of the equipment for the answer "
12897,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits "
12900,410.1,Luis,,"so while oxygen tank and a mask and suits are part of the equipment they use for this question we're only focusing on what they use to discover water on the moon ","just the orbiter and the microscope "
12903,410.1,Oliver,,,"i'm really sorry but we have to go now "
12908,410.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me "
12910,410.1,Luis,,,"um i think i got this all figured out saw on god "
12915,410.1,Luis,,,"okay you want me to say it now okay um my answer is water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and that is right from the story "
12918,410.1,Luis,,,"paragraph five agile oxygen hydrogen can also be used "
12921,410.1,Luis,,,"like important "
12924,410.1,Luis,,,"okay "
12927,410.1,Jazmin,,,"oh well and they drink "
12930,410.1,Chris,,,"on it's heavy and that was my answer oh they don't have to carry the heavy water in the ships if it's already on the moon "
12933,410.1,Farrah,,,"i i'm kind of confused "
12935,410.1,Farrah,,,"well my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time "
12937,410.1,Farrah,,,"the water on the moon "
12939,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i don't think it's that valuable "
12944,430.3,Farrah,,"you don't think it's valuable so i see where you're coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot of time and money so student can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon ","okay oh okay um oh well this is interesting okay the moon can serve as a stop as crafts to refill their gas tanks "
12946,430.3,Farrah,,,"i don't i don't know "
12951,430.3,Farrah,,,"i'm having water on the moon, would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things. "
12956,430.3,Farrah,,,"well it could bring more astronauts they don't have to put the water on the ship "
12958,430.3,Oliver,,,"um well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
12960,430.3,Oliver,,,"i read it online and well if there's water on the moon it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years "
12966,430.3,Jazmin,,,"yes i think it's valuable because you can't survive without water and that's very valuable "
12969,430.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i i also think it's valuable because if you split the water like i said i'm astronauts can i can breathe the oxygen "
12971,430.3,Chris,,,"you yeah yeah it's valuable i think having more money the spacecraft's definitely valuable "
12974,430.3,Oliver,,,"um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for giving every one of us the space to share our responses and opinions it really felt like you cared what we had to say and some teachers don't make us feel like that so thank you so much "
12978,430.3,Luis,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12980,430.3,Luis,,,"all right okay "
12982,430.3,Farrah,,,"water "
12987,410.2,Oliver,,"i really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought the answer to the question was not what student thought ","yeah cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that i did have i circled the last sentence which says arm you need a scientific poll on a microscope to look really closely "
12989,410.2,Oliver,,,"i think it's the microscope but i guess since we're in this class it's not the microscope but i thought it was the microscope "
12991,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay "
12993,410.2,Oliver,,,"by water we're so small they have to use a microscope to see it "
12996,410.2,Chris,,,"what do they use to find the craters "
12998,410.2,Chris,,,"no i don't know i mean i know a lot about space but i don't know that "
13000,410.2,Jazmin,,,"well i put in my answer that nasa sent a small machine i don't know why my answer is wrong "
13003,410.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i read that part too "
13007,310.1,Luis,,"I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon. You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right? ","yeah yeah "
13009,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm on the thing that i'm like student said or maybe that you said are student your set i don't know um i think that that's probably the equipment the thing that they said "
13011,310.1,Jazmin,,,"it was lunar orbiter "
13013,310.1,Oliver,,,"i yeah yeah so that was it "
13015,310.1,Oliver,,,"um it's a center "
13017,310.1,Oliver,,,"so it flies flies through space "
13021,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and oh gosh i don't even remember what the question was now "
13024,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay student it says nasa send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so it was a small machine that investigates "
13026,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh ice deposit it's it's looking for ice deposit "
13031,310.1,Chris,,,"okay yeah yeah yeah i got it oh i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots um lots and lots of different equipment "
13033,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah "
13035,310.1,Chris,,,"hey i'm sorry no i will wait go ahead "
13037,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
13041,310.1,Oliver,,,"i don't have i don't have confusion but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch um i know this was short and we just met but i really appreciate how you help us look for evidence from the text in our answers "
13045,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13049,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so she went first i figure i don't have to say the exact same thing as her because i found that same answer "
13051,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sure i have the same answer as her because i i think it's the microscope "
13054,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah i do "
13057,310.1,Oliver,,,"uh huh because looks like the teacher went offline so we'll wait a moment "
13059,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sure so i was saying that i do think the microscope is right because it says i'm a water they found us microscopic blah blah blah blah you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13062,430.3,Jazmin,,"so i can see why you think that the microscope is important but i do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon if you want to look in paragraph two and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used ","teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13065,430.3,Oliver,,,"okay i see your machine called the lunar orbiter they don't say anything about that one off finding water "
13071,430.3,Oliver,,,"okay so i read a thing right and i'm i see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits i hold in total 32 ounces of water i mean they say but it could hold water but they don't actually talk about water in the first part "
13075,430.3,Jazmin,,,"thats why i think mine is right teacher because i mean they did use that one and i think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water "
13079,430.3,Jazmin,,,"Oh, oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter. "
13084,430.3,Luis,,,"i know a lot about space astronauts can't breathe up there so boom oxygen tanks "
13086,410.1,Luis,,"which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon. ","oh um yeah no i guess they don't use that to discover water "
13089,410.1,Luis,,,"Oh okay yeah I see Jazmin why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water. "
13094,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah the lunar orbiter yeah perfect and i looked for ice deposits "
13099,410.1,Chris,,,"was looking for the keywords like how you said to student you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph i saw that it was also talking about water on the moon "
13102,410.1,Chris,,"But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry. ","i was just gonna say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13107,510.1,Chris,,"But right now we're talking about this one question and my only suggestion my suggestion for you is. you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water ","Okay, so different a different key word from the question. "
13109,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later okay "
13112,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay bye bye "
13119,510.1,Chris,,,"here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon "
13122,510.1,Luis,,,"Excuse me. "
13124,510.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
13127,510.1,Luis,,,"um okay let me look again "
13131,510.1,Chris,,,"no not in that paragraph i don't see anything about equipment Yeah yeah "
13136,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay i'm saying small machine machine is like equipment lunar orbiter is to pass it on surface i'm just just a small machine "
13140,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah they called it the lunar orbiter that's great thank you Excuse me. "
13142,510.1,Jazmin,,,"that's what i have my i answer i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
13145,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said that nasa found a small machine and that's the same thing student just said and you said it was good "
13150,510.1,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits it in a large polar crater "
13152,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh ok "
13156,510.1,Oliver,,,"know you'll be used the um the microscope cause that was my answer was a microscope yeah "
13158,510.1,Oliver,,,"i'm yeah i'm okay and i said you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water yeah "
13166,510.1,Luis,,,"mmm hmm okay i was kind of spacing out for a second there um what you say def i said but they use a microscope to look really closely at the water well i mean you do use a microscope to look at things but i don't know why they would bring a microscope all the way up into space i mean they usually use a microscope when they get back down or on their space shuttle or something i think i don't know i don't know about that one Right. Oh, I'm, I'm all okay I don't know. "
13169,510.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13173,510.1,Luis,,,"well i didn't go to nasa but i did um i've seen that in box yeah "
13176,510.1,Chris,,,"and we didn't see the lunar orbiter but we did see something also be sent up to the moon i don't remember exactly the name of it um oh yeah i don't remember the name of it but it was something small that they sent up to the moon before "
13178,510.1,Chris,,,"i'm not clear on so which one is the right answer is usable microscope "
13185,510.1,All,,,"yeah "
13189,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for asking us some good questions that made us have to look back at the story to see if we can actually back up what we're saying like i saw that student couldn't find equipment and then i think for student to what what they were saying so that was that was really helpful thank you "
13192,510.1,Luis,,,"excuse me hi um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13194,510.1,Luis,,,"okay "
13197,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah and i want you answered our questions so i'm not even sure why why we're in this class "
13206,420.2,Farrah,,"so do you class see anything that could support your answers from the text ","yeah in in in paragraph three is where i got my answer and i think it's supportive in in paragraph three "
13212,420.2,Jazmin,,,"at the at the end of the paragraph um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah um but i i don't understand why my answer is wrong i'm student i think the answer is the small machine like that's the right answer i'm not sure why mine a while i am in this class but i know that the correct answer is the arm the small machine or the lunar orbiter the small machine called the lunar orbiter is the correct answer "
13215,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um cuz well we we got the answer sheet and so i know our answers didn't all get 100 on them and so that's why we got pulled into this class and so the teacher told us that was the answer so that's how come i know "
13217,420.2,Farrah,,,"fine if that's the right answer but still so how come my answer is not the right answer "
13220,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon and that's why i said i'm the small machine i that's why i picked the one from paragraph to because it says i'm that is going to investigate and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and to look for ice deposits that that means like to discover them to find them for the first time "
13222,420.2,Jazmin,,,"thanks "
13224,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that i guess i still don't know how come i'm in the class kiss my answer was right i got it from the right place "
13226,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i mean in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters so i don't think i'm wrong either "
13229,420.2,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits "
13232,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i mean i i support what's the microscope cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story "
13238,430.1,Jazmin,,"that is true they are using the microscope to look at the water however i like how student really looked at the question and she looked at the word discover and when we think of discover we think how did they find water on the moon ","paragraph to paragraph two, oh "
13246,430.1,Oliver,,,"okay well i guess i gotta look in paragraph two ice depository small on top of the top layers i was just like for glasses blah blah blah on your original land look for deposits okay i mean i guess i see at an end that where they say they're going to look for deposits yeah i mean i think i think i think um but it isn't paragraph two because they say that the lunar orbiter is gonna look for the ice deposits so yeah i think jazmin's right okay okay um okay well it's it's time for us to go to lunch um anyway i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate you having us to keep looking back i felt taxed and to think about the words and the question too i think about that helped me think about my answer something like i gosh i don't know "
13248,430.1,All,,,"okay bye "
13250,430.1,Luis,,,"good morning "
13254,430.1,Luis,,,"excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13266,430.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
13274,430.1,Farrah,,"your answer isn't addressing what equipment the scientists used to discover water so first let's maybe dissect the question a bit to really understand the question ","well i mean in my answer i i said a tool uh the microscope because i use that to look at the water "
13280,430.1,Chris,,,"okay so i saw the part where i found it in the story where i i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that was the equipment that i thought oh yeah i could see that because student said microscope for equipment and student said on the lunar orbiter for equipment "
13282,310.1,Chris,,"And thank you Jazmin for explaining your answer and using the text really well. ","and i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13290,310.1,Luis,,"answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's. ","I noticed that too. And that's why I oh I looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water yeah i didn't see that much "
13303,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um i don't think it's mine it's in paragraph two um it's ok i'm gonna look because i did see it oh yeah yeah you're right student it is um these eyes deposits are very small oh just like you said teacher oh scientists said that one of the yeah so so this paragraph's about the lunar orbiter yeah like i said so it's they use they use the lunar orbiter to find the ice deposits "
13307,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch well i really appreciate how you made class feel so valued with their answers and how like you know i heard you tell student and student that they did a good job finding evidence from the text and then i remember now that i i picked the microscope because i was thinking about how it was looking at the water but you said to discover means to find the water and so you helped me think about what some of the meanings of the words discovered mean too so oh thanks so much it was really nice having you "
13311,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13314,310.1,Luis,,,"i mean ask me anything i know i know everything that i need to know "
13325,310.1,Farrah,,,"i couldn't remember it but i have it on my tablet i have mine on my tablet too "
13330,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah i can share mine oh i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13332,310.1,Farrah,,,"i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13340,310.1,Farrah,,"so student i really liked in your answer that you mentioned the evidence from the reading you quoted the reading really well and i really liked that and you also found in the text where it talks about specific things that the question asks it talks about specific things that the question asks ","thank you "
13346,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i can read the question okay the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon "
13349,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah it's like something that you use to do something like in pe class coach always says okay go get the equipment and then we get like the balls and thing "
13356,310.1,Farrah,,,"i thought that that's why i thought my answer was right because in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic so that means that they found the water and and then they talk about the microscope in the next sentence "
13369,310.1,Chris,,"and i really like that you took us to a very specific part in the text ","yeah sure and you know i also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits It's in the first in the first paragraph "
13374,310.1,Jazmin,,,"And my answer came from the second paragraph. so i guess it's all over the story "
13378,310.1,Oliver,,,"i was just looking at that time so i'm sorry it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay "
13384,310.1,Chris,,,"i was just saying hi "
13386,310.1,Luis,,,"well i was gonna speak excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13389,310.1,Luis,,,"i mean well i know a lot about space "
13394,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah we have it on our tablet "
13399,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
13403,310.1,Oliver,,,"um ok equipment is ike what you use to do things so like in pe class coach always tells us go get the appointment and then we get like the balls and stuff "
13408,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ok i i used equipment in my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13413,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i was kinda gonna say the same thing as student because i used equipment and my answer too "
13422,310.1,Chris,,"a lot of people use a lot of good language in their responses um student and student you class really use a lot of nice language specific language from the texts that i really appreciate ","I can. "
13425,310.1,Chris,,,"it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so it wants us to enter what what did the equipment well i don't know how to say it in another way yeah what equipment do they use to find water on the moon i guess is another way "
13429,310.1,Chris,,,"oh that's good yeah yeah you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13437,420.2,Chris,,"but just some common mistakes i think are that some people just didn't use specific words from the text we want to really reference the text just so that we show that we found our evidence in the text you know i think it's important that when you say something you know you have evidence to back it up so in case somebody asked oh how do you know that how do you know this is true you can say oh i found it in this source or you can say you can quote the text um so would class maybe like to revise their answer and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word ","well i know mine has some evidence from the text yeah mine too i pulled mine right from the story too "
13441,420.2,Jazmin,,,"no i don't mind "
13449,420.2,Oliver,,,"it's the lunar orbiter oh sorry i'll raise my hand it's the lunar orbiter "
13454,420.2,Jazmin,,"so now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language student would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed ","ok um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter "
13458,310.1,Oliver,,"is really, really nice way to phrase that. ","good excuse me teacher i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining more that some of us needed to do a little bit more specifics from that text because i guess i didn't do that too like jamine so now i know "
13466,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher "
13468,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
13473,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah "
13486,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
13490,420.2,Jazmin,,"but what we want to do is we want to make sure that that you're using terms that are in the reading like just just like the ones that we just talked about like microscope like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading does that make sense ","i have to add more vocabulary "
13495,410.2,Jazmin,,"but i want to hear more specific answers like what kind of small machine that they sent we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading i just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading right ","see oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter so it's called a lunar orbiter "
13499,410.2,Jazmin,,,"oh that's it "
13504,410.2,Oliver,,,"that my answer i said that um the microscope already um ah but like just like sabrina did um and i guess the one that student said too "
13506,410.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa "
13510,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i know that scientists yeah me and my dad we went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so they use a lot of different equipment "
13522,410.2,Chris,,"But I want you to make sure that before you answer that you're looking at the reading you're reading all three of the paragraphs, you're definitely taking the time to look at the words that are being used. student i want you to be able to come up with your own answer in your own words ","yeah uh huh "
13526,410.2,Chris,,,"ok ok "
13530,430.1,Oliver,,"so you didn't quite answer the question there you did say a fair point but the question really was what type of equipment did they use to see the water what type of machines did they use so if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was a really short time um i appreciate how you encouraged me to use my own words and then i heard you tell some of the other class that they should make sure that they read the whole question "
13535,430.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13539,430.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah let's start with me "
13544,430.1,Luis,,,"i don't remember "
13556,420.2,Jazmin,,"try and highlight or underline some of the types of equipment that they use and then maybe we can try and adjust your answer again okay so i'm going to show you my example sentence right here this is how if it were me i would start this sentence but keep in mind there's a million ways to start the sentence i would say to discover water on the moon the scientist used blank ","oh i just underlined it that's the lunar orbiter machine oh that's "
13559,420.2,Farrah,,,"teacher well jazmin's looking i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13568,420.3,Jazmin,,"alright student will student you keep looking and try and find an answer for you read it again if you have to and highlight and underline keywords or examples you find and you look you can find at least two more tools that you can pull out and use in your response you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope you'd also need blank and you'd also need blank that would be a good start so again my suggestion is to think about the question in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading ","yeah i'm ready "
13570,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i was saying i wrote this intense now i found a more equipment name "
13578,420.2,Oliver,,"i didn't really see that you understood the reading well because your answer was i circled the same as student now i'm sure you did circle the same as student but i want you to come up with your own words and your own answers what types of equipment did you see in the reading so again the example sentence might help you ","yeah the microscope "
13582,420.2,Oliver,,,"was that was the one you were looking at the lunar orbiter "
13586,420.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13590,420.2,Chris,,,"that wasn't what they were asking i was trying to answer the question "
13592,420.2,Chris,,,"i would say that's equipment because we were talking about equipment but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm "
13595,420.2,Oliver,,,"upside interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go "
13603,420.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13605,420.2,Luis,,,"ok "
13614,420.3,Chris,,"i want you all to take 35 seconds and i want you to reread the reading but i want you while you're doing that to underline or highlight at least two types of equipment mentioned in the reading ","well i need a two on underline just equipment right "
13620,420.3,Farrah,,"i want you to underline at least two types of equipment that was used in discovering water on the moon okay ","yeah i saw in paragraph two there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
13623,420.2,Jazmin,,"perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me ","yeah let me try teacher i said the small machine couple lunar orbiter so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13627,420.2,Farrah,,,"i got an answer to "
13629,420.2,Farrah,,,"um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate "
13632,420.2,Jazmin,,"you said that nasa sent a small machine that's perfect nasa did send a small machine but i want you to add more i want you to build on that now you went back and you highlighted the lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one ","i highlighted the microscope to "
13634,420.2,Jazmin,,"perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them ","i need i need a minute "
13638,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i did the same ones that student did i highlighted the lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope "
13642,420.2,Chris,,,"well there's spacecraft i think spacecraft as equipment "
13647,420.2,Chris,,,"teacher i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13649,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm ready "
13660,420.2,Oliver,,,"the same ones i guess class else because also the only two that i saw full lunar orbiter and paragraph to another microscope i already had circled on my on my tablet awesome let's see. what's the question what equipment that scientists use their equipment that scientists use was a lunar orbiter and the microscope "
13662,420.2,Oliver,,,"teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for for helping us i'm really look for more details in the story because i thought i did find everything but that one you said to read and highlight i found more "
13665,420.2,Oliver,,,"see you "
13670,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good i'm ok i'm good too excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13672,420.2,Luis,,,"okay "
13679,420.2,Farrah,,,"i got my answer that they use the microscope my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13681,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i got a different answer "
13684,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i thought it was i thought it was a lunar orbiter i wrote down you know nasa sent a small machine "
13692,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay let me look again so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so investigate um so i was thinking about you know like when you watch the investigator shows where they're looking for clues so then i was like well investigate is when you're looking for something and i didn't choose the microscope because they were looking at the water not looking for the water so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13696,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh okay "
13699,420.2,Chris,,,"well yeah i had a completely different answer than them i said let me look at what i wrote down yeah scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
13707,410.2,Chris,,"but you didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name ","um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon but i didn't see the name of the machine "
13711,410.2,Luis,,,"okay okay yeah i can get that okay fine but me i mean i know my answer is right too because i talked about equipment and i know that it's appointment that scientists use because you know i read about space all the time "
13713,410.2,Luis,,,"oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
13718,410.1,Chris,,"alright student so when we look back at the question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon while it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon ","okay they do use oxygen tanks but they didn't use them to find the water okay okay okay i guess yeah i could go for that you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13726,410.1,Jazmin,,,"okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i could okay okay well so then what would be my how would i tried to change my answer to to make it like a complete answer "
13729,410.1,Jazmin,,,"uh huh "
13733,420.2,Oliver,,"That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it. So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect. ","okay i just have to put the name of it on there oh i crossed it out i guess they didn't need to cross it out oh okay wow okay oh man um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for keeping us to like look back at the question i kept hearing you say oh but student that's a good answer but it's not in the question that's true student but that's not in the question so i guess we have to we have to like read the question a little bit more closely next time "
13739,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say that i know all of this stuff so i don't think i need to be on this class i don't need any help "
13741,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay i can do that "
13745,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay yeah so my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
13751,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it. how do you find if you can't see right so when i was looking at the different types of reading i thought microscope was the best answer because you couldn't discover something unless you could see right and and we know we know that the water was microscope "
13755,310.1,Farrah,,"and I love, how you said that you look back at the reading to like determine which machine you thought would be the best one. ","that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because well i can look and see because i'm not really sure is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing i guess i could second look at "
13759,310.1,Farrah,,,"is the answer to the lunar orbiter "
13762,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i also got that answer from from what said and i said that it's the lunar orbiter "
13764,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i did the first time and then i heard her say lunar orbiter and now i know it's the lunar orbiter "
13767,410.2,Oliver,,"i love how you worked together with her and i think it's great to work with your classmates in class but for your answer i want to hear what you have to say ","okay um well i think it is the lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for you know what i mean like something that actually discovered the water was in the question and like found it and then you said they they they looked in the microscope after they found it so then it has to be the lunar orbiter that out "
13771,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i think i am just a little confused i was confused because i also thought it was the lunar orbiter like why my answer was wrong "
13774,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah my answer which really was nasa send a small machine "
13778,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yes so i was thinking that when i was reading like it was saying basically that like okay where does it say i can read it it says nasa sentence for me she called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i thought that was the answer the question was saying like what equipment that the scientists used to discover the water and so that makes me think what had to be the lunar orbiter right so i i was saying that it was the small machine that they you know they sent this fall machine it that was the the answer "
13783,420.2,Jazmin,,"i really like how you look back at the reading and really understood the question because you totally did my only suggestion for you like your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue otherwise your answer is perfect ","okay that makes perfect sense so like to make a complete answer it has to include the name of the thing yes awesome thank you "
13788,420.2,Chris,,,"um so okay so i was just you know i was a little bit confused because i was thinking like well okay i was thinking that i went to nasa so when i was there with my dad i aw that like they had stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and i was thinking like they have to have use those to discover the water so i guess i'm confused by that tonight and "
13793,410.1,Chris,,"In the question is asking what did they use to discover water on the moon, and while they use so much equipment up in the moon, I couldn't even tell you half the names of them, the article, the reading says that. ","oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there like maybe it was a like a nasa they call it an unmanned pro and that's like you know maybe that was it "
13796,410.1,Oliver,,,"i'm so i unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i really just wanted to thank you um this was a really interesting conversation so thank you so much for working with us bye "
13800,410.1,Luis,,,"so i just wanted to say that i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i need any help i don't need to be in this "
13802,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah i get i can stick around for that yeah for sure "
13806,410.1,Oliver,,,"awesome "
13809,410.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out "
13817,420.2,Farrah,,"well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and i think it's really important to work with your classmates but when answering your question on your own paper i really would love if you could explain your answer rather than say you didn't listen to someone else ","oh yeah i can do that so basically what we said was we thought that you would need a scientific tool called the microscope we thought that was the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water we agreed that it was the microphone right student yeah Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope? um yeah so basically we we picked microscope because i think he was that the waters microscope no not a telescope you need like a microscope to see microscopic water it says you can't see it unless you have a microscope or like i guess yeah so you need to be able to see it and basically if you can't see the order like how are the astronauts like finding like when you know what i mean like how are they supposed to discover the water if they can't even see it "
13823,410.3,Farrah,,"i totally understand where you're coming from and i think that's a great way that you class interpreted the reading but the question is what small machine discovered the water so if we look back at the reading the microscope is what they use to view the water not what found it ","um i guess but actually it's kind of music because like i still think like that question like yeah they could see the water and they could study the water but how could they do that if they couldn't find it "
13832,420.1,Oliver,,"what i suggest what you class do next time is look at the question and look at the reading for keywords ","yeah i can see make sense i guess yeah that makes sense we need to look kind of but i think that we okay so we were looking at the keywords right there yeah we were looking at the keywords and we were trying to find like okay so we were looking for equipment and we found other equipment in the reading but we still thought the microscope was was the answer because we thought it had to be the first equipment that they use other than like a spaceship "
13836,410.3,Oliver,,"and i'm glad that you guys didn't notice that when you guys read, but the microscope was to look at the water that was already discovered ","yeah okay so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover "
13839,410.3,Jazmin,,,"so i just had a question i was just like why my answer was wrong "
13842,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah what i said was that yes it's it is "
13845,420.2,Jazmin,,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect. ","oh oh so like that so they so this is the leader or better to discover or rather the scientists discovered water on the moon using the lunar orbiter right "
13847,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes "
13849,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so i was just the key because my dad and i went to nasa and i i know that they use like equipment like oxygen masks suits and stuff like that so i was just wondering like should that be in the reading "
13853,410.1,Chris,,"so you're definitely right about how nasa uses so much equipment to do so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water ","like okay i think that makes sense oh okay oh okay does that make sense like okay i think that makes sense "
13857,410.1,Luis,,,"um so was my answer right "
13859,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
13863,410.1,Luis,,"that is true and it's basically just what i told student that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water ","yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water "
13866,410.1,Luis,,"but when we look back at the question its assets only asking specifically what machine they used to find the water, not all the other machines. ","interesting "
13871,410.1,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular it was really interesting and helpful how you asked us about kind of like like how we got to the answer you know because it was helping us to understand ourselves how we got to the answer and then you helped us by like you really made us feel value because every answer that we had like even if it was like kind of wrong on you made sure that we knew that it was you know a still a valuable answer so thank you so much "
13876,410.1,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher i shouldn't be ms great i already know all about space "
13883,430.3,Luis,,"you bring up a really great point i saw that you used your background information when you answered that question so i love the fact that you knew about the oxygen tanks but i really wanted you to use some information from the text when answering this question ","Hmm, OK. OK, I'll "
13887,430.3,Farrah,,,"the water "
13891,420.2,Luis,,"okay great so next time when you're doing this maybe explain what the microscope was used for ","um well i see a couple of pieces of equipment and the text you you you're right there isn't anything about the oxygen but they have talked about a lunar orbiter and i talked about the the microscope like what student said "
13893,420.2,Luis,,,"um well it says that it landed on the moon um let me see what that means about finding water i'm not sure "
13898,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well still don't understand why my answers wrong "
13905,430.2,Jazmin,,"What this small machine was so you said exactly what the texts needed, which was NASA send a small machine. to the moon so that's correct but i wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon so do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information ","okay so i should look for what the machine did "
13907,420.2,Jazmin,,"and maybe add what the machine was called ","okay "
13912,420.2,Chris,,,"an instrument okay i guess it probably be something that you can say "
13919,420.2,Chris,,,"okay okay i'm gonna read it and see a small machine called investigate look for ice deposits in a large crater i suppose well the only other paragraph that talks about the waters paragraph three so what does it say in paragraph three that they use for an instrument to find water "
13921,420.2,Chris,,,"it's something you use to look at really small thing "
13925,420.2,Chris,,,"well it didn't really say it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely you know i went to nasa so i know that i just use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits right "
13932,410.3,Chris,,"you use those but i don't think they use those to necessarily find the water ","you put it doesn't i don't know i don't know how how they got bad answer from the question because the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon and you need a scientific to column microscope so it's the same answer is student ducks into that "
13937,410.3,Chris,,,"I think so. Cuz she explained more of it. That's what made her that that's what made it a better answer. "
13939,420.2,Chris,,"yes so she took the instrument she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water ","okay yeah i think so "
13942,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah cause i read the question i'm like here are some words you're saying is that one equipment the scientists use to find to discover water on the moon so i was like a microscope isn't equipment and this paragraph is talking about water so so that's why i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13947,510.1,Oliver,,"great so i really liked that response because you explained yourself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response ","oh thanks okay good job "
13949,510.1,Luis,,,"okay so i i read the whole thing again and i think the answer is about the lunar orbiter because i know that um i think student said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ice and ice just frozen water and so that's why i think that's "
13958,510.1,Oliver,,,"thanks thanks a lot hey i'm on excuse me teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to her site thanks for helping us know that we needed to use more evidence because i heard your toll student and student that they had to pull from the story and all that for the rest of us that we should try to find more stuff in the story to us in our answer so thanks for that by "
13965,510.1,Chris,,,"it's asking for the name of equipment "
13968,510.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13970,510.1,Luis,,,"oh okay "
13974,420.3,Luis,,"right so i think that you and student and student all did this you used all of your background knowledge when answering this question which is great in this text it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer ","okay "
13979,420.3,Farrah,,,"ok so i found a small machine i found the lunar orbiter "
13982,310.1,Jazmin,,"good so student and student you both found specific information for the text so that is great ","well i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
13990,310.1,Oliver,,"to answer the question fully you would need to describe the exact small machine that found the water i love how you got the answer by using evidence from the text ","ok ok okay but they also a microscope is a small machine and it does say that they looked for oh they looked at the water using a microscope so that that should count "
13997,310.1,Chris,,,"Ok, ok. as we're talking about equipment i was thinking so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
14005,310.1,Oliver,,,"reach every reader ok ok so it looks like it's time for the next class so we'll see you later teacher "
14015,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good yeah okay sure, and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. um it wants us to say. if water is valuable or not "
14021,420.3,Farrah,,"so let's all look back at the reading and see if we can find any important context clues that might tell us right away what the answer is ","okay um the um the first like title it says water is a valuable resource "
14024,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay well i mean i see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource but then in the story it says something different all right yeah yeah like okay i have the same answer as student because when i read the like a sixth paragraph it says it says that it's gonna be really expensive "
14029,310.1,Jazmin,,"right so you again you're using some evidence from the text which is great ","ok okay well i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
14034,420.2,Jazmin,,"And I don't think that that answer was based on evidence from the text, but I think it was based on your background knowledge which is great to use when answering questions, but for this specific question. i think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable ","well i'm still kind of confused because i found this this one right in the story so how come it's not evidence "
14037,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four for example future astronauts could drink this water "
14042,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think so "
14044,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well would i i think i'd still keep the first sentence right "
14048,420.2,Chris,,,"um i guess the sentence after it astronauts could drink the water water is heavy takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft that's what i put in my answer um i did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah "
14053,420.2,Chris,,,"so how come i'm here because i used the evidence from the text and including the part that you told student she should put in her answer "
14058,420.2,Chris,,"the water is heavy and it does take up room on the spaceship but you didn't relate it back to the question of how that would be valuable you said it would be too heavy to carry the water but then your response should have something about why the water not being carried would be a good thing so just elaborate a little bit off of that ","um saying more about why it would be valuable "
14060,420.2,Chris,,,"cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel "
14062,420.2,All,,"so make sure to relate our answer back to the question that's being asked ","bye "
14065,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh we're we're pretty good we're excited to see you "
14067,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's more of like a statement like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i really even need to be in this class "
14069,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i can do that "
14075,420.2,Farrah,,"and i thought that was great response i noticed that you used your vocabulary but maybe we could elaborate on why they use this tool what does this tool help them with so referring to the water on the moon text can you kind of elaborate on that response can you tell me why you need a microscope ","yeah so okay so what i saw when i was looking at it is that it says the water is the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you don't like you have to have the microscope to even see the water do you know what i mean and see the water how do you find the water "
14082,420.2,Chris,,,"that's interesting because i was thinking about crater so you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well okay so like you know i've been to nasa so like i know that scientists use lots of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mass and shoots and i guess like that's something they use right "
14085,420.2,Chris,,,"i'm not sure "
14088,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well actually the thing that i was thinking about was i wasn't really sure why my answer was well "
14094,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like in the in the text it was saying and pick up three that no no no a pair of to this moment she was the lunar orbiter is that is that what i got wrong i didn't say this thing "
14098,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah that's great now you you've built on your response and you made it an amazing excellent well thought out response nice work ","i had kind of the same thinking and what i was thinking was basically that like the water was microscopic and i was thinking like you can't you know what i mean like i guess i was thinking like how did they find the water and it seems like they found the water using the microscope "
14100,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i can say was just wondering since i was thinking like that it seemed like the lunar orbiter we see that they use to discover the water so is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one "
14107,310.1,Oliver,,,"um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for like first of all you really made sure that we kept going back into the text and being like what what does it say in the reading and you were really beginning to help us make sure we were using evidence and in our answers and i think that was really cool and like what seven and i you asked us like why we came to our answer and that was especially cool because it got me thinking about like how i think about stuff and like how i do it so it was really cool when you're asking us like how did we come to our answer so thank you so much for working with us it was a lot of fun bye "
14109,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14118,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
14123,310.1,Farrah,,"so that is a great response i'm noticing that you use the text to support your answer you used the two words scientific tool ","oh yeah okay um so cuz i was looking for like you said the arm the words in a question i was looking for equipment and water on the moon and i saw in paragraph three they talk about finding water which is what the question is asking about discovering water and then the lesson into the one that has the name of the equipment "
14127,310.1,Jazmin,,"awesome i noticed you said exactly to where in the text you found your answer in paragraph three i noticed that it said that they used a microscope to find water and this is exactly what the question asks i really like how you referred back to the question to help support your answer ","yeah i said i said to small machine and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
14131,310.1,Jazmin,,,"small machine called i guess that it's called a lunar orbiter "
14136,310.1,Jazmin,,"awesome so see you just improved your response by just looking back you read that sentence and you strengthened your response ","um so i guess i still don't know what what my answer should be do i just have to add the lunar orbiter to the answer to make it right "
14144,310.1,Jazmin,,"by looking back in the text you found another thing that they use to discover water on the moon by adding those key terms you're answering the question and that's great ","so so if i say i'm nasa send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate To investigate. well i mean the question says to discover water that's not the same thing as investigating water "
14146,420.3,Jazmin,,"it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover. ","okay "
14148,420.3,Chris,,,"oh yeah i was thinking about some other specific equipment it's not in a story but i did i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks mask suits "
14156,410.1,Chris,,"to help you understand this question this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water yes they do use that equipment to help them discover the water but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water ","oh yeah yeah okay i see what you're saying i see what you're saying okay um what for my answer um i guess i'm trying to think what did i miss okay so i've got the scientists on craters for water on the moon scientists found which one is student right or is student right which which equipment one is right "
14162,430.2,Chris,,"so you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like student and student added ","okay oh so like scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters for water the moon "
14164,430.2,Chris,,,"i was adding lunar orbiter into my answers oh scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters full of water on the moon "
14168,310.1,Oliver,,"awesome so you started with they found these craters of water and then you you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used ","oh sorry sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and actually it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
14172,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14181,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah oh scientist phone critters all scientists fall for water "
14185,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i just heard it when i was reading my answer when you said what equipment was i'm missing equipment "
14191,310.1,Chris,,,"scientists phone creators for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
14195,530.1,Chris,,"so can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning ","i'm ok ok i didn't have the name of any equipment in my answer and then i added the names of pieces of equipment in mind "
14199,310.1,Farrah,,"alright so i'm noticing that you really strengthen your response from the start to the end you really use that you're thinking and you use the text to support you ","yeah um well i took all the same thing yeah and i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
14201,310.1,Farrah,,,"me "
14204,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i said on scientists use know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
14209,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah cuz i was looking for all of the keywords in the question like how you said i'm always looking for equipment and discover and water and the moon and that was the only place that had all of the parts in it "
14212,310.1,Farrah,,,"they said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water "
14214,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i was looking for the word water i forgot i didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter "
14218,310.1,Farrah,,,"you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate "
14221,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i think so so we just have to say both of the names of the equipment in our answer "
14223,310.1,Oliver,,,"because they used both of them to find the water "
14227,310.1,Chris,,,"okay i was just thinking about some other equipment you know that the scientists use because i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks "
14235,310.1,Oliver,,,"no no it's a machine Right okay yeah I wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself, I just I figured the astronauts were there with the machine. yeah yeah that makes sense. when you were talking to student and student like why i would have to add both of the machines there until you kind of asked me until yeah so that was useful for me "
14237,310.1,Oliver,,,"thanks "
14239,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
14242,310.1,Luis,,,"well i was just going to say i kind of know all about space already so i don't even think i should be in this class "
14244,310.1,Luis,,,"ok i'll do that "
14246,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
14248,310.1,Luis,,,"i think the same stuff like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that i think they used the same thing "
14252,410.3,Farrah,,"they did use that because we can not breathe the air on the moon so we did use that student you're totally right about that one however they needed to use a specific equipment to really really find water because it was very very hard to find ","yeah i guess i was wondering so it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water and i was thinking that because i said that they must have used the microscope so i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong "
14256,410.3,Chris,,,"Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff. So they didn't need that stuff. "
14259,410.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i just was going to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge that was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already inaudible thank you for letting us share "
14265,410.3,Luis,,,"so i said that you need a scientific will call a microscope to look really close so i said basically i circled the same thing i student i i said that scientists craters pool of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely on yeah and basically what i said was that like you would need to um well okay so nasa has like all this stuff and so basically like you know what i mean you need all this other equip "
14267,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know all about space so i don't really think i even need to be on this because i already know all this stuff "
14273,420.2,Chris,,"thank you so much for sharing your responses to me i want to particularly point out student and student s responses you class did a really good job of highlighting the exact equipment that we use student and student i'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use ","well so i went to nasa so i know like from going that scientists use a lot of equipment like student was saying that but they use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean "
14276,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay so yeah okay so i think that what they use was like oxygen tanks and stuff like that like student was saying and i know a lot about space so they probably use like some kind of like pack to like drink water from and like all that kind of stuff "
14279,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i am just wondering why am i wrong "
14281,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it was right "
14284,310.1,Chris,,"i pointed out student and student both of you had done a really good job from the beginning naming the exact specific examples of equipment ","um no i just was i raised my hand by accident "
14288,310.1,Oliver,,,"alright welcome back so oh actually i believe one of the students had something to say hang on one second i'm so thank you for working with us for just a short time but we really wanted to thank you for like even though we only have you for a little bit we wanted to thank you for being so kind and for really making sure that class answered the question and that nobody felt left out so thank you so much "
14291,310.1,Luis,,,"we're good work excited to work with you "
14295,310.1,Luis,,,"um so i was just gonna say that um basically um i i kind of already know like all about space and i know that we're like here in the class to to help us with our answers but i don't think i really belong here as i already know all about "
14298,310.1,Luis,,,"that's cool i guess i can stick around "
14309,310.1,Jazmin,,,"because i well i guess we proceed with that is to look to see why my into what's wrong "
14312,410.2,Jazmin,,"okay yeah let's go back into your answer you had said that nasa send a small machine this is not incorrect they did send a small machine however in the text it provided the actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was ","yeah okay i knew what it was i knew that it was "
14317,410.2,Chris,,,"on i think i was just gonna ask like well okay so we with their highlighters we highlight can you tell me again we highlight the things that are that are different i wasn't able to hear you what fortunately "
14320,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah i can hear you "
14323,410.2,Chris,,,"Does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense Okay, I think I can do that. "
14325,410.2,Oliver,,,"we can read super fast so we we did our two minutes "
14334,410.2,Oliver,,,"so i just was are we reading the the text as well like through paragraph six or just paragraph one through three "
14338,410.2,Oliver,,,"gotcha okay cool i think we found some cool stuff "
14343,410.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i highlighted two things first i highlighted the microscope because i thought that was something that you really mean like would be important and then as i was reading closely i saw that like another thing like a piece of equipment that you use on the moon is this thing called the orbiter "
14347,410.2,Chris,,,"um yeah i think i might be not quite right though but what i said was i said that the the craters i don't know if it's equipment but i thought that maybe you could think of it as equipment because it holds the water you know what i mean "
14354,410.2,Chris,,,"Oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so, even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it. "
14356,410.2,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next part but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
14361,410.2,Luis,,,"on so i guess like kind of what i was thinking is that like so i learned a lot from our last session and i do that i'm probably pretty good now i think i understand that "
14363,410.2,Luis,,,"okay i got it "
14370,420.3,Oliver,,"alright so i'm going to have us do the same activities before i'm going to give you class each a highlighter and you are going to read the section highlighting keywords and phrases to help answer the uuestion reread the second section paragraphs three through six of the text and then i want you to highlight two specific examples of how water on the moon could be valuable and then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does class have any questions before we start ","all right "
14375,420.3,Oliver,,"so now i'm giving you highlighters and i want you to go through those sections that you just read and i want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon ","all right we got "
14378,420.3,Chris,,,"all right "
14382,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so i saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing i saw is that like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important because like you have to drink water to survive and so that was really important as you could drink the water so that's one thing that's huge and then another thing that's useful is that you can use it to make oxygen to people so like that was saying that maybe they were going to put a moon base on the moon and i was thinking well they could use the water to make oxygen and to breath "
14387,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i mean i kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that i noticed was that like i circled the same thing as student for the first part i put down that you could drink the water because i know how important it is to drink the water but i also said that you could make walk it like that just just out of each to oh i think is the chemical sign for water you can rock it yeah yeah "
14393,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and see me a little bit is still in display skin my skin but i can say this one day like quite sure when i'm confused about like i'm not quite sure like a we certainly are we're highlighting the things that we need to do that that like we can use the water for is that right "
14396,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay that makes sense because that makes sense "
14398,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh that's okay "
14403,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i just didn't quite get the question right the first time um yeah so i was thinking about the moon base and i was thinking about the fact that like they were maybe going to do that for 2024 and it made me think a little bit about like they couldn't do a moon base if they did have water because just like student and student were saying like you have to use water to bring but then you can also use water to make rocket fuel and you can use water to make oxygen so you can breathe in the in the space like the little the base on the moon which is pretty cool "
14412,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so okay so i think when i look at it one of the things that jumped out was was interesting so like they said that it might be hard to extract some of the water so it made me think like what kinda you know what i mean like what kind of equipment with the to be able to bring out the water but it seems like because we're able to drill on earth that we would be able to do it so i guess well okay so i guess i understand that like that the water is a big thing that you could drink the water and you can also it sounds like rocket fuel and you can make oxygen and then like to be able to do that like what they have like a couple plans for how they might do it it seems very possible to make it seems like something that they could do and i know that student and depth but maybe it will be a long time before they do it but i guess i think maybe could be done really quickly "
14424,420.3,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us first off to like correct our misconceptions because we have a lot of different ideas but they weren't always like accurate so you helped us understand like kind of what we needed to focus on and you also reminded us to use the evidence from the text and like even more than that you asked us about how we were thinking about stuff so when we talk about how we like think about stuff you know what i mean it helps us to sort of figure out how we got the answer and maybe make even better answers next time and um yeah it was really interesting that you you really value our our answers and because of that it was really comfortable to share so it probably we could share out in the class even if we were you know wrong because you would help us to learn like maybe what was more correct that was really cool thank you so much it was really fun "
14428,420.3,Luis,,,"um well i was just gonna say that i know like all the stuff about space so like i don't really think i even need to be in this class "
14430,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah sounds really cool "
14432,420.3,Luis,,,"well yeah so i was i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that "
14439,420.3,Farrah,,,"so i believe they use the microscope because you you said that we should look at the text so why i believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see and then the text it's like saying that the waters microscopic so like i think that's it "
14447,410.3,Jazmin,,"But they never said they need to use a microscope. But since they use the word microscopic that kind of infers that they needed to use a microscope. Remember ","and so basically okay so to use the text that you sent so basically i was in say nasa sent this small machine and am i supposed to say like more than that Yeah okay so nasa sentence she called the lunar orbiter to investigate so it's the lunar orbiter right "
14453,410.3,Jazmin,,,"Since I was just i guess i don't understand why my answers were wrong you know what i mean like i my original answer was saying like nasa sent a small machine i was just wondering like what was what what was wrong with that answer "
14457,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yes yes the equipment was the small machine "
14460,420.2,Jazmin,,"sure so that that is a correct answer a small machine i guess i'm just looking for you to be more specific ","yeah okay okay so i think i understand i said nasa sent a small machine but i should have said like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right "
14463,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i just was gonna say i was wondering like scientists like when my dad took me to nasa we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i wondering like did they not use those things "
14470,420.2,Farrah,,,"i think just some of the equipment because they have lots like hundreds maybe even thousands of pieces of equipment so like how could they you and i mean i think that's the most an unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we don't have much i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were looking at the text and like drawing from the meeting or like what we were saying and also you look help us understand like we were beginning to sort of clarify and things like this is how we thought about this you know what i mean "
14472,420.2,Farrah,,,"helped us make sure that we were on like understanding the keywords in the question and helping us to use evidence from the text in the answer so thank you so much for working with us "
14475,420.2,Luis,,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space. "
14480,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I do remember that. We learned that if somebody says something, then you can say what they said, I think. OK, I don't know. "
14484,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok so when i looked back i actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story "
14489,420.2,Farrah,,"ok so sometimes if we just include the quote we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote so it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts or the writer's thoughts ","ms mahoney inaudible yeah "
14491,420.2,Farrah,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14496,420.2,Farrah,,"so the more details we add can make our answer better ","yeah yeah "
14499,310.1,Luis,,"awesome student i know that you were talking about all your knowledge and your background knowledge is very beneficial and i love how you have that ","well how my knowledge relates how my knowledge relates to the question and the story well i mean so i know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon so that part i feel like that's how my knowledge relates because i know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon "
14501,310.1,Luis,,,"no i couldn't find anything in there "
14505,420.2,Chris,,"so maybe you already knew that piece of information but you can find another piece of information from the text so right now we're focusing on stuff you can find from the text and we always want to do that first and if you have more information to add that's great you can add that later but we really want to focus on what we're reading ","yeah i mean it's about science though it's not about the story but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
14507,420.2,Chris,,,"ok ok that sounds really cool "
14509,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything but i circled the last sentence just like student so i was just trying to think if what you told student i guess is the same for me "
14513,420.2,Oliver,,,"that she's gotta say stuff in her own words she can't just pull the quote from the story Yeah. Ms. Mahoney, I just saw the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch. This was really short, but I really appreciate how you really helped us think about how we found evidence from the story and our answer or how we needed to add more work and not just the evidence from the story, like me and Farrah. "
14516,420.2,Oliver,,,"hi "
14518,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah it's me student excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14520,420.2,Luis,,,"ok "
14526,310.1,Farrah,,"sounds good ok now i saw a lot of vocabulary that you class used in your responses and that's amazing and you did a really good job with that ","yeah i said that they used the microscope Yeah, in paragraph 3. "
14530,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i noticed that the first time because i was looking for the word equipment and then i didn't see equipment so when i was looking for it i was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water and so that's how i found it there but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14536,420.2,Jazmin,,"so what you did was you answered the question but we need more tools too maybe think further on our answers so that's what you did you looked through and you tried to find the word that fitted but maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text right and then if we reread through the text we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article ","they said that nasa sent a small machine "
14538,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said that nasa sent a small machine "
14541,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah ok i see that one right there yeah ok i see that "
14545,420.2,Chris,,"so that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific so you're not wrong it is a small machine but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification so it's nice and clear ","ok ok well i went to nasa it's me student right here i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like lots of different equipment that they need to use to go to the moon "
14548,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah sure i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
14551,420.2,Chris,,"so even though you do have your background knowledge that we activated and even though you know that they use a lot of different tools maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used ","the lunar orbiter or the microscope so my answer is wrong "
14553,420.2,Chris,,"to answer the actual question which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question ","ok ok ok "
14557,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok ok miss lisa it's time for us to go to lunch i know it's been a very short time but i wanted to say i appreciate how you helped us look for more evidence in the text to put into our answers so thank you bye "
14560,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi good to see you "
14563,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i was just gonna say like i already know like all there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to even be in this class "
14568,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the microscope is the tool that they use and i think that because of what they said in the beginning reach every reader he said in paragraph three you wouldn't be able to see it for the water is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i'm thinking that they could how could they find the water if they can't see the water you know what i mean "
14571,420.2,Oliver,,,"and yeah i've used it "
14573,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw mr anderson use one and like was he was looking at i think it was like i think he was looking at his spit or something it was like something like that we were looking at like really close "
14577,420.2,Chris,,,"Actually yeah I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that like when i was like went to nasa that scientists use oxygen tanks at masks and stuff like that i was wondering like where does that fit in "
14582,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah when you say how would i broaden what would that look like "
14585,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah it was called the lunar orbiter "
14588,420.2,Farrah,,"So that could be useful in your response. ","oh i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong "
14592,420.2,Farrah,,"but we just need to beef up your answer a little bit and use a little bit more academic vocabulary ","we're looking at the water on the moon "
14594,420.2,Farrah,,"you might want to add that into your answer as well to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage ","so like "
14598,530.1,Oliver,,"so what would you with our discussion today what would you say your answer would be and how would it change ","Mmm hmm. Well, I guess. Okay, so if Farrah was like kind of something like Talking about the scientific tool and like more complete is like something. it uses academic language by like how do i know which language you use "
14606,530.1,Farrah,,,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. have before we go i just wanted to add like in particular i wanted to thank you for encouraging us to use the text and also like that you were helping us you were very positive as we were trying to think about our answers thank you so much "
14608,530.1,Farrah,,,"thank you "
14610,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space "
14615,530.1,Jazmin,,,"no i don't remember "
14618,530.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i see that nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits and so it can land at the south pole and look for ice to pass it in a large polar crater "
14620,420.2,Jazmin,,"great so incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading so i think that would be a great detail to add in your answers ","to write down all i'm sorry you think i have to write down all of those words "
14622,420.2,Jazmin,,"but if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand ","um you're saying i have to take a big long sentence and then i have to write it but not copy down the exact same word "
14629,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess that's a few less words okay "
14631,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
14637,430.2,Farrah,,"however you the you use the words exactly from the passage so it's good that you showed me that you read the passage and you understand but i want you to put it in your own words to show me that ","oh much i'm not sure "
14640,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing "
14642,430.2,Farrah,,,"it's really small "
14644,420.2,Farrah,,"it's really small so saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage ","ok ok "
14646,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay i think so you're saying kind of like student where i gotta i gotta put it in i gotta say more stuff in my own words maybe "
14650,420.2,Oliver,,"exactly put it in your own words to show that you understand that's perfect ","well cause when you asked class to say their answers and student said hers and i realized that she had the same thing that i had i talked about the microscope and the story the part where it says that they they arm you need assigned the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's the same thing but i circled in my answer to "
14652,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water and when i read the story that i only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment looking at the water "
14662,420.2,Oliver,,,"student said the microscope student said i'm a small machine i think i think you said the lunar orbiter um i guess it's one of those i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits mm hmm "
14670,410.2,Oliver,,"so so basically the words that your classmates have been using and what you already know from going to nasa those are some of the words i want to hear in your answer those are some of the words i want to hear in your answer so our question was highlighting the equipment that science scientists use to find the water on the moon but we need to highlight the equipment that they used ","i'm excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you so much for giving all of us suggestions on how we can improve our answers and how you you listen to all of our ideas and suggestions i were different for each one of us so thank you "
14673,410.2,Luis,,,"i guess i was just gonna say that i i i don't think that i need to be in that class because i don't think i need any help because i already don't our space "
14675,410.2,Luis,,,"awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that "
14678,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i could click to when i will do a new paragraph and it basically said paragraph to that let's see nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investing so i thought this small machine was what they used to find the water "
14685,420.2,Oliver,,"so next time when we're giving our answers to these questions we want to make sure that we're including details like the name of the small machine that nasa sent but you're absolutely right ","um yeah so basically i was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see "
14689,420.2,Oliver,,"so like i told for student when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well ","cool yeah i can do that "
14691,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i was just kind of thinking as i was listening to you talking to oliveron class i guess i was still confused because you know in our class this is to help us to understand better um i guess they don't understand like why my answer is like not correct why it's wrong "
14698,410.2,Farrah,,"we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it ","oh i'm sorry "
14702,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i was just wondering like you i i guess it kind of had in my imagination like there was an astronaut who had a microscope and wasn't looking at the at the water but student was saying that there was something else that they use so maybe they didn't have any instruments "
14710,510.1,Chris,,"definitely use your imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving your answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions ","yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the student said the lunar orbiter that's what found the right and then they looked at the water maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the um so I guess, I was just picking. up because i went to nasa and i know that scientists is a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and sutent thing i was wondering where that fits in to the reading "
14718,510.1,Chris,,,"oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like okay so if there was an astronaut on food maybe they use that but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut because they sent the small sheet yeah that makes a lot of. "
14720,510.1,Jazmin,,,"my next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us this is really cool because i think we understand a lot more thank you so much "
14724,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay so basically when i looked at the end it ended i see it oh in paragraph one on it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these traders are dark places where the sun never shot so that's where i saw the part about "
14731,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah i guess because the question was what equipment right did they use so i guess i was talking about the craters because i was thinking that like that's where they had the water you know and i mean with the craters so but the question is what was used is that right "
14733,510.1,Chris,,,"we so "
14736,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i guess i would say like the equipment that they use so it sounds like they use if i was listening to class it sounds like they use on the lunar orbiter to find it and then they use the microscope to to study "
14741,510.1,Chris,,,"oh i see yeah "
14743,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah that makes a lot "
14745,510.1,Luis,,,"um so i was just gonna say that this has been really fun and i think that i've got it all figured out so i "
14752,510.1,Luis,,,"that's a that's a really good question um i guess let me look at see i'm well i don't see any oxygen tanks i guess i was using what i do because you know i visited nasa and i'm even student and i went together with his dad and so we saw that astronauts have to use the oxygen tanks but i remember you said that maybe there weren't any astronauts at all so maybe they didn't need oxygen "
14756,310.1,Luis,,"i love how you use your background knowledge to answer the questions ","yeah i think so that you gotta do what "
14763,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i was just when i was thinking about this when i think about and i'm like well they it says like what equipment to they used to discover the water and i'm thinking like well obviously they use the lunar orbiter have to discover it but like i guess in this case it seems like there should be more information like a lunar orbiter like probably has blocked it experiments but like what are the instruments like how do they find water without without seeing it with a microscope like i can simply use the mask "
14768,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah like the idea that like student and student and they were saying that like even i mean like you need other stuff like you up astronauts and other things like that and i guess it just got me wondering like could you use this to find water or do you just need to use the lunar orbiter "
14770,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
14774,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i guess for me i so i read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon maybe by 2024 that was the goal and i was wondering like did they will they like us to you know what i mean to have water for the moon base "
14777,310.1,Oliver,,,"that "
14784,310.1,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i in particular i wanted to thank you for pushing us to think about what we were saying like you really the first you really listen to what we said so you didn't like cut us off you like really heard what we were saying you let us talk to each other about like what we thought about each other and but you helped us to really understand like what you were looking for and so as a result i feel like we were able to have a really like in depth conversation which was really fun interesting i feel really interested by this stuff that we've covered to thank you so much it was really fun to work with wasn't it oh yeah it was awesome thank you so much bye bye bye "
14790,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah that was my response yeah "
14798,310.1,Oliver,,"that was actually really good one thing i noticed was that you took the evidence from the text that scientists wanting to see things see the orbits the craters closer and you connected that to microscopes which is really good ","um yeah so i agree with student and i thought basically that like um you know you would need the microscope because they said in the reading that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it with your eyes and so i was thinking like the scientists would have to bring a microscope with them to see the water and so i guess that's how they found the water "
14801,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i was just gonna say that honestly like i already know all about space i don't think i need any help i don't even think i should be in this "
14807,310.1,Chris,,,"oh that's a really that's an interesting question um "
14810,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i was gonna say that i went to nasa so like with my dad and so i noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut is that right "
14812,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so basically just what i was gonna say was i wasn't sure why my answer was well "
14816,420.2,Luis,,"i think that we can add more details to your answer so let's do a sentence spring ","um well the lunar orbiter like it goes up to the moon and orbits the moon and it studies like different things like beams down stuff and maybe it sends a rover but it like goes down and looks at like what's happening on the "
14824,420.2,Farrah,,,"Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for asking us to use evidence in what we were like saying because that way we were able to back it up using the text and like you were helping us to really understand what the question was and i think some of us didn't know quite what what the question was looking at like the question was saying like you know if the lunar orbiter was was what they used to invest and discover and i think that also like you really helped us to like build value i think we all felt like our opinions were really worthwhile so thank you so much for working with us bye "
14826,420.2,Oliver,,,"all work good and we're excited to work with you "
14829,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah there's nothing i am kind of know like all this stuff already so like i don't really think i need any help i don't need to be in this class "
14836,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon "
14842,420.2,Jazmin,,,"I was acutally kind of confused, because I wasn't sure, we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right. So, I was kind of wondering like, why is my answer wrong. "
14850,420.2,Luis,,"but what we want to do is add more supporting details to give yourself a stronger answer ","yeah so what i realized that student and i okay we both were talking earlier like luis's answer about how the scientists use lots of equipment so i was gonna say i'm watching student do you want to say your answer um yeah so here was the thing like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and suits and masks and that stuff so i was thinking like you know like maybe the the reading was missing important like things like do you know what i mean because how could the scientists be up there like getting water if they don't have a spacesuit "
14859,310.1,Oliver,,"you connect to the fact that the waters were found on the moon is used for oxygen right ","um so yeah i thought that student was right and i i found that evidence myself what i noticed was that the microscope okay so student and i talked and we said that you can't find the water if you can't see it like you'll have to be able to see the water so we thought like how could they discover the water unless they use the microscope first "
14861,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh that's all "
14866,310.1,Chris,,,"so i kind of was just well okay so i was thinking about that i went to nasa so i like you were saying i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits things like that so it kind of was making me think like did they not use those to discover the water like they use those like you were saying in the second reading "
14875,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay basically i'm sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we really wanted to thank you for working with us this was really fun thank you "
14880,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water and the water help them stay hydrated you can't survive without water right paragraph four were actually going to hear to have evidence for what you just said "
14883,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
14889,310.1,Luis,,,"so yeah i kind of know all about this i think i am good "
14891,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five is that right "
14893,310.1,Luis,,,"okay having water available on the moon we need more room on the spacecraft people and things like oxygen tanks "
14896,310.1,Chris,,,"well they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that "
14898,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah i would love to so okay my answer and i actually this way but i also saw in the reading because i did look at the reading this time teacher um i did look at it and i saw that the water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
14900,310.1,Luis,,,"oxygen "
14905,310.1,Farrah,,,"Okay. it says that you can use hydrogen you can use it to make rocket "
14913,310.1,Oliver,,,"well so i actually have my opinion is that water um yeah i can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable but it's not ready yet like they talk in the reading a lot at the end about how hard it would be to figure out like how to even like find the water like they said in the first reading that like it was like there's just like little microscopic particles of it and you have to somehow get out of the dirt and out of the craters and all this stuff like that's really hard like we don't have something that can just do that we'd have to invent it and build it so i kind of am thinking that the evidence is not convincing because just because the waters there doesn't mean that we can use it "
14918,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i yeah i i do think it's valuable but i think because i was trying to read the question really closely like we did last time and because it's saying like is the evidence convincing i don't think it is i think that the evidence says that the waters like i think it will be valuable in the future but i don't think it's valuable "
14921,310.1,Chris,,"i love how you were challenging the question itself ","I was gonna say I think Oliver and I were talking about this, that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that. "
14929,310.1,Jazmin,,,"reach every reader well i just wanna say that i was a little bit confused because i thought the water was valuable as a defense argument i actually really think it's a good argument but i think you could argue both ways like i think you could say that it's not valuable because yeah because it's really hard to get it out of the way but i think you could also say is valuable because like sometimes right like you know like my dad works for like my dad works for oil companies so like they know that they sometimes look for oil and they don't know where it is yet but it's valuable even if they don't have it yet so maybe "
14937,530.1,Oliver,,"Oliver, has that change your thinking a little bit? ","yeah that's a really good point, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us clear up like any kind of misconception we had and making sure that we use evidence in our answers and also um you really valued all of our answers so i think that class had time to explain their ideas and i think like right class like class thought value right like class was like we all felt really like heard and then like thank you so much for helping us understand like what we needed to work on because you gave us ideas for how we could improve our answers in both of our classes so that was so awesome thank you so much and bye "
14939,530.1,Luis,,,"asked me i shouldn't be and that's great i already know all about space "
14947,530.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay so when i was reading the text and i was looking at the question let's talk ask for evidence right that scientists use and some tools some equipment and so i was reading and i was looking for equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment oh and then i saw about the microscope fit to the tool and i was like oh that's equipment so i'm probably right and they were talking about looking at water so so yeah so that's how i got there "
14954,530.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14958,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um well i mean i just i i feel like i i put words down from from story and so "
14962,530.1,Jazmin,,,"to investigate the lunar orbiter good "
14965,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah we we use it in in and miss smith science class "
14969,530.1,Chris,,,"so in this miss class we've been looking at like an amoeba and really small thing so we use a microscope to look at stuff that we can't really see i mean we can see it but like we can see it like like a whole lot more it's really kind of like you know expanded or or or closer up in the microscope "
14979,530.1,Luis,,,"um well not before that class no um i mean i've seen it on tv and stuff but we don't have one at my house Oh wow, yeah. Yeah, that'd be man. I think so. Cool. to see like water up close on a microscope and see like what it looks like that'd be real cool yeah "
14982,530.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that's high does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so lots of different equipment that they use "
14988,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah definitely i think it'd be like really really cool to go to space and to see the moon and maybe like walk on the moon yeah that would be great "
14991,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i mean i think it might be cool to go to space but i feel like if we make it too easy to go to space and that'll make it too easy for class on earth to just you know like to keep destroying our planet because the planet is dying and class is just kind of giving up on it and figuring they'll just go and like live on mars or something and so maybe we shouldn't make it so easy to go to space "
14999,530.1,Oliver,,,"i'm nah i'm just chillin chillin back oh excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking some time with us and for helping us to bring him some of our background knowledge and true book for classroom "
15001,530.1,All,,,"thank you class "
15006,530.1,Luis,,,"sure sure okay let me look at what i circled in a story excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15008,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay i found it so it was in the um third paragraph "
15012,530.1,Oliver,,,"i was looking for um you know like water on the moon and finding water and a tool and so they talk about the scientific tool which is like equipment "
15014,530.1,Oliver,,,"and that paragraph they talk about the water they found is microscopic so we've got equipment and finding water and that's "
15016,530.1,Oliver,,,"um they used a microscope to find water on the moon "
15021,530.1,Luis,,,"i had microscope i said i said oxygen tank so i don't know what the small machine was that she was talking about "
15023,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm looking at the story now so i can see it it says nasa small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15026,530.1,Jazmin,,,"still don't understand why my answers wrong "
15028,530.1,Jazmin,,,"so it is right "
15031,530.1,Jazmin,,,"oh ok "
15033,530.1,Jazmin,,,"wait but we still have four minutes "
15038,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah cuz i guess i was just trying i was listening to what you said to student no i don't remember what your sentence was student that that teacher helps you to make um i said man i don't remember what i said either let me look up a story "
15041,530.1,Farrah,,,"the water with a microscopic okay but if if student is right that means i'm right but then "
15046,530.1,Farrah,,,"okay okay so we're both right "
15049,530.1,Chris,,,"i worked at nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
15051,530.1,Chris,,,"um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right "
15055,530.1,Chris,,,"i wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon "
15062,310.1,Chris,,"so that is really good that you realize that that was from the article ","will be super microscope and student set the lunar orbiter so i guess i could "
15064,310.1,Chris,,,"for water on the moon with a microscope or the lunar orbiter "
15066,420.2,Chris,,"yeah you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those were two equipments that they used to discover water on the moon ","okay so i'll just add that in and then maybe i'll make another sentence but i think i can just "
15068,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry it's time for us to go to lunch "
15071,420.2,Luis,,,"i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
15074,420.2,Farrah,,,"know i think i was thinking that because the article says that it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so that means that you can't use it for a long time "
15077,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah but the story says that that it it'll take a long time "
15081,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i said it's not ready yet because the same thing on okay at the end of the story it says scientists need to come up with a plan for tracking so they don't have a plan and that says making less plan will take a lot of time and money no but that sounds like that water it's not ready yet "
15084,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay i'm still kind of confused "
15089,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so anyway right what they said no because it's not i didn't even realize and the last paragraph where they talk about how much money and time it'll take i didn't i didn't think about that "
15091,420.2,Jazmin,,,"maybe mine is not right "
15103,420.2,Jazmin,,,"said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
15105,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um i know they said the thing about drinking it because i got that street from this text "
15109,420.2,Luis,,,"i wrote about curing it but i guess you can't that's not what it's used for Okay, I I did say that it could be split into two parts, hydrogen oxygen. "
15116,420.2,Chris,,,"I forgot about that part yeah I did read that part. And you know I read that there was there could be a base on the moon by 2024. yeah cuz, then the thing about carrying the water wouldn't be an issue okay astronauts could breathe oxygen hydrogen also be used as rocket fuel oh that's what you said. "
15124,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok "
15126,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay i think i got one "
15129,420.2,Farrah,,,"water will be valuable for a long time but when it is they can make rocket fuel and they can breathe oxygen "
15136,420.2,Oliver,,,"i was pretty good let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel you said breathing mm hmm all the last sentence maybe when it's ready mm hmm they could make a gas station out in a solar system "
15140,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh oh okay i just saw the time it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for helping us keep trying to find the evidence and a text to fill out our answers "
15142,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay it is by teacher "
15146,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh the water Uh, I don't know where. The water they found on the moon, I guess. "
15148,420.2,Farrah,,,"in the craters "
15150,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me ms kelsey "
15152,420.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15154,420.2,Luis,,,"oh ok "
15156,420.2,Luis,,,"well they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk i'm not sure what other equipment they need "
15158,420.2,Luis,,,"uh huh ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater ok so it's a lunar orbiter and it investigates "
15160,420.2,Luis,,,"ice deposits "
15162,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
15164,420.2,Jazmin,,,"ok ok i don't remember nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok so it's a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter and it investigates "
15166,420.2,Jazmin,,,"whispering the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits "
15174,420.2,Jazmin,,,"if it's cold there If the water's frozen? No, because it's just frozen water. Uh huh, yeah. "
15176,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits but the crater part was in the beginning of the story whispering no atmosphere oh here it is ok scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
15178,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah me and my dad went "
15182,420.2,Chris,,,"no no we saw the mars rover but i don't remember seeing anything about a lunar orbiter What did they do with the water that they found on the moon? I don't know, maybe they drank it. "
15184,420.2,Chris,,,"well this says that you need a microscope to look at it "
15186,420.2,Chris,,,"no i guess not but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters "
15188,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i'm sorry to interrupt i was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch i know it was a really short time but i do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer "
15191,420.2,Farrah,,,"all right "
15194,420.2,Luis,,,"um so yeah i was just gonna say like i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i think i'm right i think i should go go out "
15198,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah ok so my initial answer i was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which i knew because i already knew that and then um well basically then i did the reading and looked at the reading and once i did the reading i saw that the that the scientists actually well the real answer is that scientists found ice using a small machine "
15204,310.1,Luis,,"i like that you used your background knowledge because that tells me that you're really thinking about what you already know ","um well i guess cuz it has to do with the reading because the first time i didn't read it i just knew the answer but i guess that wasn't the right answer so i decided to actually read it and then when i read it i got the right answer "
15207,520.1,Luis,,"right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use your background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge ","i know a lot about space so i might still use the background knowledge but i mean i should probably read it because maybe i don't know everything "
15209,520.1,Farrah,,,"i change my answer to "
15212,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so basically i said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then i said after like we were in class and discussing it and i thought about it i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon so i found the right answer "
15215,520.1,Farrah,,,"because in the first instance i only said that well i said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water like you like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the lunar orbiter that actually found the water "
15218,520.1,Farrah,,,"yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz i was listening in class for saying like student was saying it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um you know other people had ideas too so i was kind of listening to that and then i was when i understood like what the question meant then i could understand better "
15220,520.1,Farrah,,"right so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers are all the way there yet ","right ask the teacher "
15224,520.1,Chris,,,"on not not about this no i was gonna say that i was gonna say i asked my new answer is ok "
15227,520.1,Chris,,,"okay so what i said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and then i realized that that it wasn't full of water when i read it more closely i said instead that the the water that scientists found on the moon was microscopic there was only a little bit like i said initially there was like lots of it but actually there's just a little bit of water "
15229,520.1,Chris,,,"um well i was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it and what i was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water and i was saying well actually it was when i had to go back you i saw that it was just a little bit of water "
15231,520.1,Chris,,"right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information ","i guess i just won't go back yet "
15233,520.1,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun bye "
15237,520.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay so i can i can tell you that basically i was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
15241,520.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
15249,410.1,Luis,,"What. ","Well, I guess it's answering the question because well it is valuable right like it's really valuable that um that they have like. you know that you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen like that's why i mentioned it because those are really valuable things in space because you can do all kinds of stuff with them "
15252,420.2,Luis,,"whoever's reading your answer isn't going to be able to make the connection, you know, so if you could. a way that i could see you making a response even better is kind of adding the question into the response so you could say one way that the water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen ","yeah that makes that makes sense yeah "
15254,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like for a long time "
15259,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like it sort of in craters but it's also kind of all over and we don't really have the technology to like go and like kind of find everything and like dig it out like it would take so much energy to do it that it doesn't seem like it would be very possible like it seems like we need to invent new technology to really be able to use the water on the moon "
15263,420.2,Farrah,,"My only concern is when you are answering a question like that you're you're trying to convince your reader of something right, so we always need to give that reason as to why right so that's where the evidence in our text really comes in, so I would go back and. keep the first part of your answer and then go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct okay ","gotcha "
15265,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so i said i'm like student i said no because it's not ready yet "
15272,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah cuz well we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like you can't really use it you'd have to do something to it but like you it's not like just sitting there ready to be used on like hooked up to a gas tank or something so you'd have to get it ready but it seems like it would be really hard to get it ready um well I guess Okay, so I could try. with evidence so i think that i would just say like no it's not ready yet and it would be hard to make it ready because it's microscopic right because that's evidence from the reading "
15277,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i would look back to your answer and add some more evidence from the reading good job ","and see what i said was asking i say yes that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water "
15279,420.2,Farrah,,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah. ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for for working with us and like in particular i just really wanted to thank you for "
15282,420.2,,,,"yeah we we all answered it and um we told you our answers and then um you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers "
15285,420.2,Luis,,,"sorry to interrupt i'm sorry but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15287,420.2,Luis,,,"um how we answer the questions okay okay yeah yeah okay "
15290,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15296,420.2,Farrah,,"that is a really good answer so remember our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and so you said you need a microscope to look really closely but one thing that your answer is missing is kind of a connection to that question is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more ","um well i picked an equipment and it's about water and i got it straight from the text so i know i did all the right things that in the question i'm in and so um and that's what it says in the story "
15302,420.2,Jazmin,,"you're right exactly so you had all of the right information it's the one thing like if i were to answer your question i'd use your exact words and say something like to discover water on the moon you need a specific scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what you're talking about you need a specific scientific tool called microsoft to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what you're talking about right ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i when i read it it said to discover water on the moon and i know that the small machine nasa sent was looking for the water so that seems like that's the right answer "
15306,420.2,Jazmin,,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called. Do you remember ","yes i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is that that that would be "
15309,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i'm good because i added more words "
15311,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah "
15315,420.2,Chris,,"so when we're gonna fix some of our answers we want to add some specific details from the text and we will so that we can show that we have a really deep understanding of the text ","yeah i bet the creators but but but something about the creators obey the partner from the printers food yeah "
15319,430.1,Chris,,"the question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right and you've told me where on the moon the water was discovered use more evidence from the text about the equipment to make your response stronger ","where the equipment the equipment well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on masks and shoots "
15326,420.2,Chris,,"so is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger ","nasa sent a small machine ice deposits and polar craters price oh okay they found craters for water when nasa sent a small machine "
15330,510.1,Oliver,,"yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job ","same thing "
15332,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah to look really closely "
15339,510.1,Oliver,,,"on you saturate have to add more details to her thing so i'm all i'm more details i guess that's on your name assigned to a pool of water we should add the water you need to look really closely at the water "
15341,510.1,Oliver,,,"okay okay i'm "
15343,510.1,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch "
15346,510.1,All,,,"yeah yeah you i i really appreciate how you helped us all use evidence from the text to add more details to our our answers thanks so much i'm teacher thank you "
15350,510.1,Luis,,,"i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
15353,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah so i said no not for a long time "
15358,510.1,Farrah,,,"because at the end of the story it talks about how it's gonna be really expensive and take a lot of time and a lot of money and they probably won't be able to do it uh huh. "
15370,420.2,Jazmin,,"but you didn't necessarily write in your answer for me or any of your classmates to see. But you just one concern that I have is that if I was just reading your response and I had no other context, I would say, well, what can't we do for a long time?. right so one suggestion that i have for you is maybe being a little bit more specific with your words and even including the evidence that you had ready to tell me in your response ","excuse me teacher i'm still confused okay so student needed like more information in hers but i put a lot of information in my answer and it's still needs work "
15380,420.2,Luis,,"so one concern i have about your response is that i was just reading your response and i wouldn't necessarily know what the question was asking from your answer so i think yeah yeah so i think one suggestion i have for you like the suggestion i had for student would just to be to add a few more specific details so that i and your peers can ","yes i like my turn thank you "
15382,420.2,Luis,,,"i was gonna say i took it from the text "
15388,310.1,Luis,,"that is what i like about your responses you took that specifically from the text ","oh well you can drink well um we need oxygen to breathe so that's important "
15395,310.1,Luis,,,"okay important resource Oh yeah that's where I found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay. see i said that and oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel rocket fuel help spacecrafts to move just like gas helps cards to okay i could say all of that stuff i'd have to write all that down "
15399,420.2,Chris,,"oxygen is needed for astronauts to breathe and so if you added that to your response it would help me and any of your friends reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us ","okay there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
15408,420.2,Oliver,,"so you said water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore so like student i really liked this answer because this is right from the text you took this information right from the text and that is a really important part of answering text specific questions and similar to the feedback i was just giving student i just don't get how your answer realtes to the question right like how does your answer show why it's valuable to get water from the moon yes please restate the question in your response ","i'm sorry teacher i was looking at five o'clock and i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch i want to say thank you for how you like made class feel valued and you kind of explained when you explain what they needed to work on it give me ideas on how i can improve my answer "
15410,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
15416,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15418,420.2,Luis,,,"okay "
15422,410.3,Luis,,"okay so let's start with you student so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on the moon so i in the article i don't recall them saying that they use oxygen tanks however i know that astronauts do use oxygen tanks ","nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate this machine it's a lunar orbiter "
15428,410.3,Luis,,,"that means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you can't see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real close the microscope i think maybe "
15432,410.3,Jazmin,,,"i don't remember "
15436,410.3,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate oh the name of it is the lunar orbiter "
15441,410.3,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
15449,410.3,Jazmin,,,"i just read it student if you are listening you need a oh the miscroscope yeah the microscope "
15453,410.3,Chris,,,"uh huh "
15455,410.3,Chris,,,"um well student just said the lunar orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right so i'm figuring that's the right answer "
15457,410.3,Chris,,,"i feel like you said section two and section three "
15460,410.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah it's the first sentence in section two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15463,410.3,Oliver,,,"uh huh "
15465,410.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i circled that same thing "
15469,410.3,Oliver,,,"because well um i was looking for where it said water and that was paragraph three was talking about looking at the water and then i was looking for equipment and i saw it said microscope and microscope is equipment "
15474,310.1,Oliver,,"that's a great job using the context of the text to find your answer ","well it's the same thing that student said right the lunar orbiter "
15477,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah let me see you know ms teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too lots of equipment "
15480,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah it's it's in the first sentence where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15483,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah because class said it "
15488,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah um cuz uh student and student read it too it was the first sentence of the second paragraph i was listening "
15490,310.1,Oliver,,,"ms teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch you know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers "
15492,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
15495,310.1,Luis,,,"yes so i have like already know like all about space so i don't really think i even need to be in this class "
15497,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i can do that "
15505,410.3,Luis,,"this phrase in general what you wrote was not used they didn't talk about that in the in the passage So did you have questions about the passage? ","yeah i was just more thinking like these are things that i know because i really love space and my dad is an astronaut and so i was thinking like even like if it's not in the reading then i think the readings leaving it out you know So I should make sure that I'm like I'm using something from from the reading, rather than- "
15507,410.3,Luis,,,"okay "
15510,410.3,Farrah,,,"um so for me basically um i guess my question was i don't really understand like right now why my answer is "
15512,410.3,Farrah,,,"yeah sorry i guess i just don't understand right now like why my answer is wrong "
15518,310.1,Farrah,,"i think it was a really great response and you had you used your academic vocabulary and you used something that was stated directly from the text ","that's great thank you "
15520,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i was just going to kind of say the same thing because like what what i said was nasa sent a small machine and i was just wondering like why my answer was wrong "
15527,420.2,Jazmin,,"and student that answer was really great you did use an idea that was stated directly from the text we could develop that a little bit more you can say you know what kind of small machine did they use or different things like that just develop your thought process a little bit more than you already have or different things like that just oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already then you already have but there's nothing wrong with your answer ","i can't tell what would a better answer sound like Ohhh, okay. That makes sense. "
15530,420.2,Chris,,,"well i guess the thing that i was thinking was kind of what student was saying before i still have a question about it because i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists like lots of equipment like you know like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that and like it just like you know what i mean like that seems really important "
15536,420.2,Chris,,"and we want to make sure we're going to we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers ","Oh "
15538,410.1,Chris,,"because we were asking about equipment not what they found ","okay that that actually makes that makes a lot of sense thank you "
15542,410.1,Oliver,,,"well basically i wrote the same thing as student so i guess i was wondering like so is the answer to the question that like that both the lunar orbiter and the microscope are used or is it like one of that is the right answer "
15546,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i'm so sorry to interrupt but unfortunately we have to go to lunch "
15550,410.1,Luis,,,"i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoyed working with you and like in particular there were like some things in the class that were so cool like you really helped us to make sure that we were drawing like from the reading when we were answering questions and like also like it was really important like when you were asking like you know when you are helping student like understand like how to approach the question like that was really clear and it was really easy for us to understand what you are asking but thank you so much "
15554,410.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15562,410.1,Farrah,,,"i said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15567,420.2,Farrah,,"I will say the there one part of improvement or one area of improvement that I think that you could work on would be looking at all of the tools that they referenced because so i just want to make sure you that you're going back and referencing the reading that we have in the assignment to make sure that you're getting all of the points possible ","oh yeah i guess you're saying that i was wrong "
15570,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay "
15573,420.2,Oliver,,,"i have that same answer us student i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
15581,410.3,Oliver,,"Did you maybe not understand certain parts of the reading? and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case. ","i mean i understood it was just that student went first so she said her answer and mine was the same i found the same answer in the story yeah i understood it "
15584,410.3,Oliver,,,"oh ok ok i guess i mean what i like i read the whole thing and i looked for all the keywords and i found i found that sentence with the keywords in it "
15588,410.3,Chris,,,"um i was looking at the question again and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
15596,410.3,Chris,,,"i mean some of it came from a story and some of it came from when me and my dad were looking at you know the pictures and the stuff that the astronauts used when they used to go on their space missions so yeah "
15602,410.3,Chris,,"I think some of it, too, so when we are looking at the reading and we are doing the assignment, we want to make sure that when we're working we're we're referencing the information that's in front of us and that's in the reading. Absolutely, I think it's the perfect time to bring up bubble my dad my went to NASA We saw this that and the next thing right. ","yeah yeah it did okay i bought my answer i did all pull some information from the text "
15604,410.3,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later "
15606,410.3,Jazmin,,,"okay bye "
15610,410.3,Luis,,,"okay no i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
15613,410.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said nasa send a small machine "
15618,410.3,Jazmin,,,"remember the name of it no "
15621,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay i see that right there it's right in the same sentence "
15626,420.2,Jazmin,,"so we just want to make sure that when we are answering our questions that we're being as clear as possible ","still kind of confused "
15631,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so when you said i have to just save the name of the machine so that part i understood but then you were saying that i should add add more to my sentence so that has more power "
15635,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so what i so what i meant by that basically is just you want to make sure that you're stating the information that's written in the text ","i have to write more words "
15638,420.2,Luis,,"it's not always about having more words you just want to make sure that you're using the text and you're able to reference the text in your reading ","yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
15647,420.2,Chris,,"That scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks it's a clear point. While they're up there, so I think in the future when you're doing your assignment and when you're reading or in your reading and you're filling up the questions and answering. your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more. ","I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024. "
15651,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay i only do what you were saying about jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but i wrote a complete sentence and i pulled mine from the text "
15657,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay "
15661,420.2,Chris,,,"okay this one isn't a question but now i'm just all thinking about my answer cuz mine came from the story too is it the same as savannas "
15670,430.2,Oliver,,"your answer wasn't necessarily answering what the question was asking so with your answer it's as if you just needed to continue writing a little bit more you kind of phrase it as like your sentence starter but didn't add more to it ","yeah it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining what each of us needed to work on because it gave me some ideas i think on how to improve my answer to "
15673,430.2,Jazmin,,,"thanks bye "
15677,430.2,Luis,,,"um it's more of a comment i have already kind of know all there is to know about space i don't know like i think i really have to be in this class "
15680,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
15685,430.2,Farrah,,,"it tells us that it tells us that it's really small like whatever it is because it says it's microscopic Really small. "
15687,430.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i am i thought that i thought the same thing i student so i i was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water "
15691,430.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah no i totally we've done that before and science like we've looked at like the plant like cells and stuff like that so yeah i've seen lots of stuff with microscopes "
15694,430.2,Chris,,,"up i was just i was gonna say i used microscopes like you know what i mean like i used to science and up my mom is doctor and she like she uses microscopes at work "
15697,430.2,Farrah,,,"it's because we weren't going to work with you because our answers weren't right like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong "
15700,430.2,Farrah,,,"totally there's a paragraph that's what i was saying the water is microscopic he wouldn't be able to see it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close to you have to like they couldn't find it unless you saw it right or did they find it another way "
15706,510.1,Jazmin,,"and i'm glad that you went back into the text because we know for our answers we want to focus on using evidence so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading ","in the in the second paragraph it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
15710,510.1,Chris,,,"i guess i was just thinking i've been to nasa with my dad and we looked around and i noticed that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that so i was wondering like where does that fit in "
15714,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah well they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water "
15721,510.1,Chris,,,"and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just really wanted to work with us today and like a particular i wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from there because you don't always remember that and you really helped us tremendously and also like it was really cool like seeing student was an upcoming show because you were like asking him for his background knowledge and also like he was able to talk about like stuff which i think is really like i think that really works for him yeah today was fun "
15723,510.1,Jazmin,,,"thank you so much "
15725,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just was gonna say like i already know like all kinds of stuff about space and like basically i like i don't really think i even need to be in this class like i don't need any help "
15728,510.1,Luis,,,"okay i can do that yeah "
15733,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay so let's basically i think let's see so you to paragraph three and we were saying okay the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see he were looking straight at it you need a microscope to look really close so like i guess that's that seems like really important to me you know like that that you can't i think you can't find the water unless you can see it well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong "
15736,410.2,Farrah,,"i just wanted to see where you found it i wanted to have like specific textual evidence in your answer i know you found it in the text but i wanted you to point it out in your answer so the rest of the class knows where to look ","okay "
15738,410.2,Farrah,,,"sounds good "
15741,410.2,Chris,,"and then student your response says that they found craters full of water but you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use to find the craters ","oh like oh i see so okay that's actually that's really helpful so like i didn't say like what equipment i just was talking about craters so i'm not sure what i mean here's the thing when i know that because my dad took me to nasa but there's like you know what i mean like i saw that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits kind of like what we're saying and so i guess i'm wondering like that's not in the reading "
15745,410.2,Chris,,,"like you have to use equipment if you're going into space and i guess i guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that you know what i mean Yeah. Yeah, exactly. "
15751,410.2,Jazmin,,,"you mean the lunar orbiter it's how they discovered the water "
15755,410.2,Farrah,,,"um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch like i wanted to make sure to thank you and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to try to clarify answers and you know asking us to make sure to use the text when we were responding to your questions to that we had added to thank you so much for working with us was really fun thank you bye bye "
15762,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah actually i think i got this all figured out i'm all good "
15765,410.2,Luis,,,"okay because you know i mean i already know that they found water on the moon i already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good "
15767,410.2,Luis,,,"well i mean i i read a lot of stuff about space and i watch nova on pbs so yeah like i have a lot of prior knowledge about this already "
15776,410.2,Luis,,,"okay okay that part i did see somewhere in this store in paragraph five it's like the second sentence can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
15782,310.1,Jazmin,,"that's great i really like that you could find that specifically in the text that tells me that you were reading very carefully ","i'm still confused "
15786,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well because what student got his answer in the text is different from where i got my answer in the text "
15791,410.2,Luis,,"okay so student your answer didn't really say whether or not you agreed that there is enough evidence you just stated evidence ","oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah "
15797,410.2,Luis,,,"i gotta say if if i think it's a valuable or not i think "
15803,410.2,Luis,,"Because your answer could have gone either way. you could have said no water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes because it does split this and that and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive so i assumed that you were agreeing but i don't want to have to assume ","okay i guess i'm not sure if i agree or not okay "
15806,410.2,Chris,,,"okay okay well i was just reading i read that there could be a piece by by 2024 "
15808,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah that could be pretty cool "
15823,410.2,Jazmin,,"just like student he didn't really state if it would be a good thing so i had to assume that the answer was a positive that you did agree ","okay well i mean it's not like exactly somewhere else in the text i guess it's still from that same paragraph now let me try to remember where i found it oh no yeah it was okay it was it was in the one above that because i i pulled it from paragraph four where it says tfor example future astronauts could drink this water so i guess i don't know if student was right or if i was right as we get to different as we got it to different parts of the text "
15828,310.1,Jazmin,,"i like that you stated your agreement or disagreement in this case you did agree and then you did say why it would be a valuable resource because there's water on the moon and they could drink it you had a very good answer and i like that it was very clarifying ","yeah yeah it does so so then i my answer is right i just wait actually what was wrong with my answer because you you said that i did good because i answered the question and i said yes "
15839,420.2,Oliver,,"so the only part that i would the only suggestion i have for you and this suggestion is for class not just student is that in your answers i would like you to state where you found your evidence next time is that in your answers i would like you to state where you found your evidence next time okay so a suggestion i would say is adding i know this because in paragraph four it states ","okay okay yeah that's actually helpful for me to teacher i love looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you took the time to explain all of their ideas and and and and then kind of make i feel like class thought to feel valued and their ideas and and i also have some ideas from you explaining what what we need to work on to get answers "
15842,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay okay thanks teacher bye "
15844,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher "
15846,420.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15849,420.2,Luis,,,"ok oh ok "
15851,420.2,Luis,,,"you want to hear you want me to tell you what i said again "
15853,420.2,Luis,,,"ok no problem so i said let me see what i wrote down oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
15855,420.2,Luis,,,"ok instead of a general sense what are they using for the water ok ok i mean they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon "
15857,420.2,Luis,,,"oh i don't know yeah i don't know "
15860,420.2,Farrah,,,"uh-huh yeah "
15862,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah "
15864,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah in paragraph 3 it was the last sentence of the text that i found it "
15867,410.2,Oliver,,"perfect perfect that's great and then so student you said you circled the same as student but i think we want to go deeper into that and i want you to have your own answer ","well i mean it was this i think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does and it's looking at the water so i don't think there is another answer "
15869,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think my answer is right so i don't know why my answer is wrong "
15871,420.2,Jazmin,,"but can you tell me what the machine is can you be a little bit more specific about that ","oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter lunar orbiter "
15873,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah that's perfect so when we're saying our answers we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general so if you have a specific thing from the text definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on ","ok "
15876,420.2,,,,"oh thank you laughter "
15881,420.2,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits "
15883,420.2,Chris,,,"ok yeah "
15887,420.2,Chris,,,"well when she read it it said to look at it really closely No. No, I don't know. "
15891,420.2,Chris,,"so when we're looking at our answers i want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well ","Yeah. I got to explain more. I got to see more. "
15893,420.2,Chris,,,"ok ok yeah "
15895,420.2,Chris,,,"ok i think i got it "
15898,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok excuse me ms mccarthy "
15900,420.2,Oliver,,,"i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think of how i can use evidence from the text in making my own answer even if it's the same as somebody else's but to put it in my own words "
15902,420.2,Oliver,,,"thank you bye "
15906,420.2,Luis,,,"yes yeah so i just was gonna say that like i already own like all that there is about space so i don't think i even need to be in this class "
15908,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i can i can do that "
15912,420.2,Farrah,,,"i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15914,420.2,Farrah,,,"in the reading "
15918,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh it was paragraph three he said that the water they found was microscopic and that you'd need a scientific tool to look really close "
15923,310.1,Oliver,,"and i like that you really pulled that from the text ","um well i said pretty much the same thing as student um you know like i thought it was the microscope as well um so i guess i have the same answer "
15925,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm not sure what what to pull "
15928,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water "
15931,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so i said that scientists found craters that were just full of water "
15933,310.1,Chris,,,"well i guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of you know what i mean "
15938,310.1,Chris,,,"well they said they said oh okay they said this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
15941,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so my answer with this it was nasa send a small machine but i was like why why is my answer wrong "
15943,420.2,Jazmin,,"so when we answer we want to be very specific so like in the text what small machine are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine ","yeah they they said in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15948,420.2,Farrah,,"yep so that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was the lunar orbiter which is a small machine so you are correct but we just want to make sure we're super specific about it ","did they use the orbiter or did they use the microscope i mean i guess i'm not sure why my answers wrong "
15950,420.2,Farrah,,,"interesting okay "
15954,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i just was saying that that scientists like well i've been to nasa so i know that scientists like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i was wondering "
15957,420.2,Chris,,,"oh sorry i was so if i know that's part of it but it wasn't in the reading how what what you know what i mean "
15962,420.2,Chris,,,"Cool. And that's, that's like different from like if i talk about something that you know this was what i thought but this is my like i said like this is where i got the information "
15964,420.2,Chris,,,"we actually have to go to lunch "
15968,420.2,Chris,,,"and i really want to thank you for making sure that check the reading mostly and then for me like i was really interested in like being able to think about how i was how i was like raising what i was saying is it got me thinking like how do i think about what i'm saying so that was really cool i felt like this interesting connection to my thoughts thank you so much "
15973,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15977,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah sure i said i'm that you'd need let me look i think i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15981,420.2,Farrah,,,"three well i was looking for equipment and then in paragraph three they they use the word scientific tool and i know that's the same thing as equipment and then i was looking for the other keywords about finding water on the moon and i saw that in paragraph three "
15991,420.2,Oliver,,"i love how you recognized tool and equipment were synonyms and found the answer that way we can go deeper into the text and get more evidence and details for the response and that would be great just make sure that we're going deeper into the text and reading it one more time so we can find even more information but if we want to look deeper and find more evidence that would be amazing ","okay well i i had a circle the same thing i student because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely if the last sentence in that paragraph "
15993,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah because i i know that a tool is something that you used to do with thing and i know equipment is something that you used to do a thing to "
15998,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i would look definitely more closely and find some more tools or more evidence from the text that we can use to support your answer to the question ","i don't understand i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16000,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i said nasa sent a small machine "
16002,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess similarly to what it is that i was looking for something that was like equipment and and i was also looking for where they would like discover the water and so that was a piece of equipment "
16011,420.2,Jazmin,,"so if you want to incorporate that into your answer and make sure that you get those details in. make sure you use evidence from the text to support that scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ","okay i have to write that from the beginning because i was just adding on to my old answer to i found a lunar orbiter "
16013,420.2,Jazmin,,"scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ","okay okay where it came from it came from nasa right "
16015,420.2,Jazmin,,,"and what it is is a small machine called an orbiter "
16018,420.2,Chris,,,"you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
16021,420.2,Chris,,,"no my answer was about the polar craters "
16024,420.2,Chris,,,"okay i remember it was in the beginning um yeah and paragraph one and why i chose it was because i was looking for some of the keywords in the question discover water on the moon and in that in the third sentence or four sentence it has almost all those words in their scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the most polar crater so it had all the keywords "
16030,420.2,Chris,,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon What equipment. well i guess i didn't i didn't use equipment but i do use discover water on the moon "
16035,310.1,Chris,,"but in the question we want to focus on the equipment they use to discover that water yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph and i understand where you would get that answer ","okay um they use the lunar orbiter to find water in the in the poor craters do i keep my craters or do i change the whole "
16037,310.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me "
16039,310.1,Oliver,,,"it's time for us to gold so we'll have to see you later "
16044,310.1,Luis,,,"i didn't ask me "
16047,310.1,Luis,,,"okay but i also just want to say i think i got all this figured out now i'm all good "
16050,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
16054,310.1,Luis,,,"okay maybe i didn't find it in here but i know that i know that they can't go to the moon without oxygen tanks "
16058,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah look in paragraph five refill the gas tanks before heading out into it oh no that's gas tanks i was thinking about the breathing part "
16060,310.1,Luis,,,"astronauts could breathe oxygen okay that's something "
16062,310.1,Luis,,,"well i mean it helps them breathe "
16064,310.1,Luis,,,"look for water if you can't breathe "
16069,310.1,Farrah,,,"the lunar orbiter but i said the microscope and the teacher said that was right "
16074,310.1,Luis,,,"because because that's what i'm student had and what student had and you you told them that was correct "
16079,310.1,Luis,,,"okay all right paragraph two it says lunar orbit our land at the south pole and okay so that's looking well i mean that's not actually water nice but ok so that's one thing for microscope they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close well actually that's looking at the water that's not looking for the water so i actually think student is wrong and i think jazmin's answers right "
16083,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah yeah yeah okay i get that "
16086,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm still kind of confused okay so i was trying to look at the sentence that you helped me to write "
16089,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm not sure like how to i mean i know i so i read nasa's into small machine and then you're like that's so vague right that the name so i then i wrote now this is meant to solve machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then there was more more that you you you suggested that i write but i don't i don't remember how to make what to add to my answer "
16093,420.2,Jazmin,,"so one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer so you can say in paragraph two ","ok ok ok ok i got it "
16103,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah mine's more a comment than a question because what i let me think oh yeah oh cuz we were talking about the water on the moon and i was thinking about how i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
16105,420.2,Chris,,,"i'm wondering if maybe they would just leave some stuff there so that they can keep building up a whole piece there and then they can leave their their tools and equipment on the moon "
16109,420.2,Oliver,,,"a small question on course as sure my answer sound the same as jazmin's answer "
16113,420.2,Oliver,,"so all of you in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response so we can all say like in this paragraph i found my answer ","ok ok i understand i got that well thanks so much teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i didn't want to say yeah thank you for helping us to realize what was missing from our answers because now i do know that i should write on like where i found the information and maybe one more sentence from a text "
16117,420.2,Farrah,,,"i think student has the first question "
16119,420.2,Luis,,,"cool yeah yeah i can do that "
16121,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah but i think some and i was going to share her answer "
16123,420.2,Farrah,,,"that's okay we can share answers it would you like us to each share answers one by one "
16125,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm pretty much the same hey "
16129,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'll start so i said that in terms of what it meant it scientists us to discover water i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close yeah and i have the same answer as um i had the same answer as seven basically i circled the same thing "
16133,420.2,Luis,,,"for me i said scientists found craters of water i was thinking that there's like lots of fun for me i was saying that basically nasa send a small machine yeah and what i was saying is basically that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that you know "
16139,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm like it sticks out that it says the sun never shines there it's always in dark "
16141,420.2,Farrah,,,"basically i had to think "
16143,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i will be in any in any case but i was also wondering like i know we're looking at the and i hate to interrupt but i was just thinking like i don't really know why my answer is wrong "
16151,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so i think like one thing it says is that the lunar orbiter is what lands and looks like i think that's really important like is the thing that looks for the ice deposit and then also well that was the big thing i saw "
16153,420.2,Chris,,,"i kind of was thinking about what student and student were saying and i was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what i mean like maybe you need a microscope to see "
16156,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah pretty much like student i think said for me and student "
16161,420.2,Chris,,,"um yeah so i think like for me that's interesting is it says like to see the water you have to use a microphone "
16163,420.2,Chris,,,"it makes me think i guess my question is like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that like there was like masks and suits and stuff that astronauts or i was wondering like why that's not in the reading "
16165,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah sorry i i was just wondering why like the suits and oxygen and stuff like that like wasn't like that seemed like that would be in court you know what i mean but it's not mentioned anywhere "
16174,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so i was thinking that it's super dry and if it's super dry like it says that it's like spread over a water area like that the water doesn't just like you know what i mean it's not just in a pool and it would be really hard to see and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a second and really thank you for working with us in particular you really like i think made class feel like they were their opinions and like yeah i think class i think also like what was so important is like you really helped us to make sure that we looked at the end to like figure out like what we were supposed to be me and you also you know you really had us listen to each other and that was really cool because sometimes we don't like listen to each other's ideas and conversations and today i was listening so close so thank you so much for for helping us "
16178,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16180,420.2,Luis,,,"oh oh ok "
16184,430.2,Chris,,"but i would say that we want to look to maybe think about things that were not specifically mentioned in the text like for example we know that nasa used the rover to find water on the moon instead your response included a bit more of just like what exactly was in the reading so we just want to work to kind of dive deeper in the text ","yeah yeah because i went to nasa with my dad so i do know about the mars rover and other things too "
16186,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah "
16191,310.1,Jazmin,,"but what i want you to work on is just being a little bit more specific with your response you know what i mean just try to pick out details from the text you know earlier we did our lesson on comparing and contrasting using context and background information so make sure with that we look for specific details in the text student your response was really awesome i love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about nasa and that they sent a small machine ","but i don't understand why my answer is wrong OK, OK, so I guess I don't know how to do that. "
16195,310.1,Jazmin,,,"uh-huh So NASA sent a lunar orbiter? "
16197,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ok so that's what i should say nasa sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon "
16200,420.3,Oliver,,"you want to make sure that when you're reading a text you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to the question as possible ","I do. I do. And I do want to say I only said that I circled the same as Farrah so I wasn't going to say the exact same thing, but I didn't like, circle it because she circled it. I just happened to have the same answer as her. "
16204,420.2,Oliver,,"i want you to try to when you're answering questions about text i want you to try to look for specific things and even if you share the same ideas as your classmate try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking ","ok ok explain my thinking ok "
16206,420.2,Oliver,,,"so you're saying if student has the same answer as me then i should try to find a different answer "
16208,420.2,Oliver,,"not necessarily for example if student has the answer then you can say the same answer but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it ","ok ok yeah my english teacher says that to say it in your own words i could do that "
16211,310.1,Farrah,,"all right perfect student your answer was really awesome i love how you talked about microscopes and that was really specific and you even described what a microscope does which it allows you to see something super up close which is what they talk about in the article ","yeah it was in paragraph three "
16214,310.1,Chris,,,"it's not so much a question but remember how i was telling you about how i went to nasa with my dad so yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
16216,310.1,Luis,,,"ok ok ok well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say mr dallas thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on so now i know that i should explain my ideas or say them in my own words even if they're the same as what somebody else said and then i also heard you tell student what she should work on too so thank you very much "
16219,310.1,All,,,"bye "
16222,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's kind of my question so i was gonna say like um i kind of already know about space so i don't think i actually have to be in this class because i don't really need any help "
16224,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i guess i can stick our out "
16232,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so your sweatshirt is "
16251,420.1,Oliver,,"great job you were able to find the important words in the question so we want to look at this question and we want to find and choose one really important word so i want you to work with your partner and i want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then i want the person on the right to go after so i want you to work for two minutes and i want you to look and choose one really important word in the question and i want the person on the left to be the one that starts talking first and then i want the person on the right to go after so i want you to work for two minutes and i want you to look and choose one really important words the question ","Okay, so. so i think i'm gonna go first okay yeah that's fine cuz you're on the left so that's cool okay so we're trying to break apart the question if i understand correctly and we're trying to figure out right like what are the important words in the question is that right i think so although actually i think we're supposed to answer the question and figure out what what the important words in the reading like you know what i mean like which were the important words we're supposed to look at so i think that's what i'm going to figure out because that's what i thought our answer was supposed to be i don't think that's quite right student but you know if you're going to do that i guess you're going to do that like what i think what i think is basically like okay so the important words in the question to be are effectively like equipment because it seems like that they want to find it and they want to like um i guess maybe scientists because we know that there and then water those are the most important parts of the question because they're saying that they're asking you what equipment do they use and then the the thing that they're finding is water and that's the most important thing of all so that's what i think i'm okay so are you done student yeah you can look at it okay so what i noticed in the actual paragraph was i thought that the words that were important were um let's see if i look at it like i think the main thing that was important was um lunar orbiter water craters ice and microscope those are the most important words in the read eight that i saw okay "
16262,420.1,Oliver,,,"so we had a disagreement and we kind of were thinking differently so i thought that you were asking what were the important words like in the question itself so when i was looking for important words what i said was like equipment scientists and water because that's what we're talking about right we're talking about finding water and we're talking about the equipment that the scientists use and how they were able to find water so that's important words student had something fferent um yeah so for me basically what i said was that i thought the most important words because i thought you were saying the most important words in the paragraph so i thought okay the most important words are water like lunar orbiter microscope oh like glass like the glass of water that they use and i and and like words like that because those are all words that that have to like that they're asking about you know what i mean "
16268,310.1,Chris,,"yeah i understand i understand your confusion ","um so unfortunately we have to go to class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
16272,310.1,Luis,,,"So I was just thinking, like, I think I got this all figured out, so I think good to go. "
16276,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah we thought so student and i both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for um and we thought that scientists was pretty important too because both of us were thinking about how much equipment like has to be you know what i mean so basically um student and i thought about a lot about it student didn't totally agree with us "
16288,420.3,Jazmin,,"I want you to look, and I want you to circle any equipment that is mentioned in the passage i'll give you guys a minute to do that. all right now that you class circled all the acquit equipment mentioned why don't we look again at all the words you circled and i want you to circle double circle all the words that involve equipment and finding water mentioned ","um i'm still a little bit confused about part of it but i think that it started to make a little more sense as we went through this sort of exercise so here's what i am circle so i circled lunar orbiter and then yeah and i kind of circled microscope but i really thought you know orbiter was the only equipment that was used to find water like i guess you could say the microscope was used to study the water but um so i circled that one to like apple circle but you know what i mean like that's that's what i ended up with "
16293,310.1,Oliver,,"student that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon ","i'm so student and i kind of work together again as we we usually work kind of together and do the same stuff as we think fairly similar and so actually one thing that i was thinking is that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and what it made me think is like it made it seem like all the equipment's even more important so like what i ended up circling i circled microscope i circled glass i circled lunar orbiter "
16296,410.3,Oliver,,"Make sure that we're really looking at the text Okay, we want to focus on what the text says. lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned however i also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment as it is just something that's mentioned as an object ","oh so they didn't use a glass to measure it "
16305,410.3,Chris,,,"okay so i circled the same stuff like actually i circled microscope and lunar orbiter i didn't circle glass because what i thought when i read it was that glass was just like how much water like 32 ounces not that they actually you know use the glass but i added because i thought it was showing or i added a few words at the bottom like spacesuit and oxygen tanks just because i was still thinking that you'd have to use them to find the water so i just didn't want to forget that because it seems like that would be important "
16312,410.1,Farrah,,"And I also thought was really interesting how you also mentioned microscope are concerned that I have with you guys, is that we want to make sure that we're really focusing on the equipment that is used by scientists to find water on the moon. ","oh so they like okay so i think they're beginning to understand so like they used the lunar orbiter to find the water but like student and i were confused right student you know we were confused because we were thinking that you couldn't find it if you couldn't see it so we thought like maybe somebody had the microscope and walked around and they put it on the microscope kind of the dirt and they were like oh look it's a script but that's not that's not right they they studied it after they found it "
16322,310.1,Oliver,,"class it's a really great job i really love you class are starting to use the text that you read previously ","um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you again for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for doing a couple things like one thing is that you really helped us to understand like what the words we were looking for in the question and you were really patient with us as we try to understand your instructions and you really encouraged us to clarify the thinking that we were using and you were like offering really really thoughtful concerns like when you told me what you are a little concerned about how how i was approaching this stuff and when you are concerned that we were all mentioning the microscope well not all of us i guess student was mentioned on student you really need but um basically like what really jumped out to me is like that um we had a really strong suggestions for like how to go forward and you really kind of like we're able to figure out how we were thinking about each problem and it really helped us to understand how to how to solve the so that was pretty cool thank you so much it was really fun to work with bye "
16327,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16330,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
16336,310.1,Farrah,,,"um okay a couple of reasons one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so i know that they do that and then when i was reading the story in paragraph three is the last sentence it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
16340,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water and in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope "
16343,310.1,Chris,,,"i said that the scientist on crators full of water "
16347,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think equipment "
16349,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16358,410.1,Luis,,"because we are looking for the specific word of the equipment that they use ","so actually i didn't even really read it because i already know a lot about space and i already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how i got that piece "
16361,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i got my part in paragraph two i just didn't say the name of the machine but i had it "
16363,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i read it it's the lunar orbiter "
16365,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i could just say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
16369,410.1,Chris,,,"um i could say scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16375,410.1,Oliver,,,"um i guess i could say um well i don't see how i can use it because i thought that the equipment was the microscope "
16380,410.1,Oliver,,,"well if the lunar orbiter is right how can the microscope be right too which one is right "
16382,410.1,Luis,,,"um no actually okay i don't know that one i don't know what that one is "
16386,410.1,Chris,,,"um well when i was reading the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater I didn't even realize that was that was the same thing, like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope. "
16389,410.1,Chris,,,"on the moon "
16391,410.1,Chris,,,"anywhere "
16394,410.1,Chris,,,"you know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16396,410.1,Oliver,,,"can i just say it like how you said a lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon "
16399,410.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah well now that i understand um yeah uh yeah i do "
16402,410.1,Chris,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
16404,410.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
16407,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah "
16410,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but i got this all figured out now so i think i'm all good "
16414,410.1,Chris,,,"um equipment "
16417,420.2,Farrah,,"no evidence we can add some evidence into our answer ","yeah "
16421,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay we already have the lunar already "
16423,420.2,Farrah,,,"i think i already put evidence in my answer too "
16425,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay well i put the lunar orbiter and then i added that to what i said about the microscope so then i have two names of equipment and i have looking really closely which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right "
16428,420.2,Chris,,,"in the craters that one was in my answer "
16433,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well i okay so what about mine because i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16438,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i'm still kind of confused "
16440,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess i don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for "
16442,420.2,Jazmin,,,"to find water on the moon "
16445,420.2,Farrah,,,"to look at the water on the moon "
16448,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah it's microscopic "
16451,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um i'm gonna say okay so let me look at my my answer before okay um you'd need all scientific tool called a microscope and a lunar orbiter to look really closely because it's microscopic "
16455,420.2,Chris,,,"okay scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter because the water well if the water was microscopic then how did they find the craters full of water "
16459,420.2,Chris,,,"so they're full of water at the bottom no oh man now i'm confused scientists have known for a long time okay well scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16461,420.2,Chris,,,"because the water was microscopic "
16464,420.2,Chris,,,"oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the water on the moon i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
16466,420.2,Chris,,,"a base like they might build a moon base "
16468,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah "
16470,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah that'd be cool "
16473,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay um okay teacher how did you know that we should include microscopic in the answer "
16477,420.2,Jazmin,,,"how did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when i was saying like i'm trying to figure out like how do i know what part of the story the evidence i should put in my answer "
16479,420.2,Jazmin,,,"definitely the lunar orbiter "
16481,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay and then the microscopic word "
16483,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh ok ok i understand okay "
16486,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter because the water is microscopic "
16489,420.2,Luis,,,"oh i gotta do this too "
16494,420.2,Luis,,,"oh okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter because the water was microscopic "
16500,420.2,Oliver,,,"um. well teacher i'm looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i am thinking about my answer and i think i learned that we have to be specific and put in evidence that tells why "
16503,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh wow that was right oh cool okay yeah well thanks teacher for telling us um what what evidence from the text we should put in our answer and and that we how to do that okay "
16505,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh thanks teacher "
16507,420.2,Farrah,,,"reach every reader well i was looking at the at the text and i thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for some things that was equipment and then the question also asked about water and so i saw in paragraph three that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope which is equipment "
16510,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i see it "
16514,420.2,Luis,,,"oh i don't think i know i don't understand why i'm why it's not the microscope excuse me i'm sorry to interrupt but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16516,420.2,Luis,,,"oh okay "
16518,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
16522,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah i had the same answer that student did that they were asking about finding water and i'm paragraph three talks about finding water Okay. They use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water "
16524,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16527,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh okay oh she called a lunar orbiter "
16531,420.2,Chris,,,"ok ok so "
16533,420.2,Chris,,,"you told student that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so i think you told her that that was the answer right "
16535,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i remember reading paragraph three but i didn't think that um that that was it because because they said that they were talking about finding the water and i had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters "
16537,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i guess so um but i do know like a lot i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16539,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah like i know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff "
16541,420.2,Luis,,,"um well well i had said that um i think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon you know when they have to wear their space shoot so and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon "
16543,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah cuz i mean i read a lot about space "
16545,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
16547,420.2,Luis,,,"um ah you mean nothing like that what you told student about "
16551,420.2,Luis,,,"not i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small okay yeah i yeah "
16555,420.2,Chris,,,"um the microscope "
16558,420.2,Chris,,,"lunar orbiter "
16560,420.2,Farrah,,,"the microscope "
16563,420.2,Farrah,,,"i think so um you know what i just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking like and having us keep looking back at the text and and and keep asking us the questions so that we can kind of keep thinking about it and thinking about it "
16565,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay bye "
16570,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good yeah i'm good too me too i'm good i had one question i shouldn't be in this class because i already know everything i know all about space "
16572,420.2,Luis,,,"ok "
16575,420.2,Chris,,,"i'll say mine "
16577,420.2,Chris,,,"i said that they found craters full of water "
16581,410.1,Chris,,"and that's great that you were able to gather that information out of the article but the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover that so are craters full of water is that a type of equipment ","no craters aren't equipment so i guess no "
16583,410.1,Chris,,,"i said since craters aren't equipment then i guess no no it's not "
16586,410.1,Farrah,,,"i could "
16588,410.1,Farrah,,,"i said the part in the story where it says that they found that they need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
16592,310.1,Jazmin,,"so a microscope is a type of equipment it's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article so that's great that you were able to point that out ","excuse me miss brown "
16594,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16596,310.1,Jazmin,,,"that nasa sent a small machine "
16598,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter "
16600,310.1,Jazmin,,,"what type of equipment did scientists use to inaudible "
16603,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't know "
16605,310.1,Chris,,,"i answered craters full of water but you said craters wasn't equipment i know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters so i would think a lot of water "
16607,310.1,Farrah,,,"a microscope "
16609,310.1,Jazmin,,,"the microscope and the lunar orbiter "
16612,310.1,Chris,,,"i just wanted to say that i went to nasa so i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
16614,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah ok "
16616,310.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me miss brown i'm sorry to interrupt "
16618,310.1,Oliver,,,"i just realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so i know this time was short but of i'll see you later ok "
16620,310.1,All,,,"bye "
16622,310.1,Luis,,,"i just wanted to remind you my dad's actually an astronaut "
16624,310.1,Luis,,,"water is valuable we've got to drink it all the time so yeah based on the article i would say yeah water on the moon is valuable "
16627,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i do "
16629,310.1,,,,"i had an idea but i don't remember "
16632,310.1,Chris,,,"it was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts do you remember what that is hydrogen and oxygen "
16636,310.1,Chris,,,"to breathe I don't know what we use hydrogen for. "
16641,310.1,Jazmin,,,"what you can use water to grow things so that we can have a moon garden on the moon that would be really nice "
16646,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i have to look again water could be useful in lots of ways they could drink the water so is water so that's something they could drink the water "
16649,310.1,Jazmin,,,"is says water is heavy "
16654,310.1,Oliver,,,"mumbling i just see them asking a question if we think it'd be a good thing "
16657,310.1,Oliver,,,"we need to drink water and i feel like if the astronauts were on the moon and they get thirsty then they do want to be able to have some water to drink right "
16659,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
16661,310.1,Farrah,,,"i guess i don't know i don't know if i think nasa has a lot of money so i guess i figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money but i don't know if it's worth it "
16663,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah my mom gets really upset if she spends a lot of money on food and then my brother doesn't eat it she gets really mad "
16665,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i see what you're saying "
16667,310.1,Oliver,,,"it's not a question but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch "
16669,310.1,Oliver,,,"but i did want to say even though we only had a short time together i appreciate how you asked each of us about what we were thinking and you took some time to explain like for student and ask her some questions that made her feel valuable and i feel like for student and student too so thank you so much for helping us think about what we were reading "
16671,310.1,All,,,"bye "
16675,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good to see you "
16681,310.1,Farrah,,,"mm hmm "
16686,310.1,Luis,,,"class excuse me yes me "
16688,310.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16690,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay perfect spot "
16696,310.1,Farrah,,,"Yeah, exactly. It's because our microscope is equipment. It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small. Yeah, in a science lab. "
16702,420.2,Farrah,,"right so you're kind of using your prior knowledge and experience to come up with that answer which is great i love that i want you to look back into the reading to circle the evidence where it talks about what you want to answer you need to have specific evidence from the reading ","it's in it's in part three it's in part three paragraph three they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope "
16706,420.2,Chris,,,"It's like to to find something "
16709,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes yeah how can you find it if you can't see it "
16711,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16721,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um well i still think that's the small machine i don't want to change my answer you don't want it's a small machine "
16724,420.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter "
16730,420.2,Chris,,"A small machine. That's awesome. But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter. So would you want to add that to your answer. ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16737,310.1,Chris,,"so i like how in your answer student you were specific and you said that they found the water in the craters of the moon ","oh well i guess what you said to student is it that is the lunar orbiter so i guess i would say they use the orbiter to find the craters full of water "
16739,420.2,Chris,,"that's perfect beautiful i love that does it make more sense that you have to make sure you're answering the full question when they say equipment you have to remember their equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well ","okay "
16744,420.2,Oliver,,,"actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but wanted to say thank you so much for coming today thank you for reminding us oh sorry "
16746,420.2,Oliver,,,"well yeah i wasn't it was really nice to meet you and we really appreciate how you helped us add more details to our answers in order to make them better "
16749,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you "
16752,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i'm shutting me and that's class i already know all about space "
16762,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so i feel really good about my answer and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i know that a microscope is a tool and it sounds like they use it to look at the water "
16766,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah that was part of my answer they found the craters of water and the craters were full of water "
16770,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um yes so um well i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16773,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes out loud "
16776,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
16780,420.2,Jazmin,,"good so what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question ","It's called a Lunar Orbiter. "
16786,420.2,Oliver,,"They would know exactly what small machine, you were talking about, because we all knew because we read the article, but other people who didn't read the article that would definitely help them out to have the specific name of it. ","honestly not totally like i got back maybe they used both but i don't really see why it's not the microscope "
16791,420.2,Oliver,,,"um no i guess before you use a microscope you probably need something else "
16793,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah um i will i will answer yeah a lunar orbiter "
16795,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i understand it better now "
16797,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16802,420.2,Luis,,,"i yeah that is what i had also said yes "
16806,420.2,Luis,,,"I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer. I mean, I think also Chris's answer. I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff. That was pretty good. because like on youtube they show how the astronauts like train with their oxygen tanks and in the old the zero gravity chambers and oh yeah "
16808,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i i'm kind of space expert on which is why i picked oxygen tanks that's my answer "
16810,420.2,Oliver,,"yeah just that was kind of from your prior knowledge yep so now we know to look you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions yes deb you have a hand up ","yeah well it's it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for really helping us understand what it meant to discover the water and not just like find it or i mean look for it yeah that was a really helpful explanation "
16813,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi "
16815,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah we can see you just fine "
16822,420.2,Luis,,"We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers. So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer. And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer. Does anybody want to talk about their response first ","yeah well actually i just wanted to remind you that my dad as actually an astronaut "
16825,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah yeah i can talk about my answer um so my answer is i'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
16827,420.2,Luis,,,"i am i sure did "
16836,420.2,Luis,,,"okay the next sentence says astronauts could breathe the oxygen Yeah. not being asleep "
16839,420.2,Jazmin,,"So there you go. Luis So we'll just add that little part to your response to make sure it's nice and clear on why it's important that the water can be broken down into those two parts. Thank you for sharing. ","um so i was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon "
16841,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes i love to garden and i love to be in nature "
16847,420.2,Jazmin,,,"when we look back at it well no i guess they don't talk about a garden but because there's water that's something you can use water for "
16852,420.2,Jazmin,,,"drinking Yeah. "
16856,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah because what you just said was a lot like my answer my answer is well water is so heavy so it's good that they wouldn't have to carry it on the ships anymore they could just get on the moon "
16862,420.2,Chris,,"right and that's a great answer because i see you got your information right from the article that water is heavy and it takes up a lot of space What that water is used for for the astronauts. ","they can drink it "
16868,530.1,Oliver,,"do you see any ways that your mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your class ","no no i'm not thinking differently because here you got look at this and in the text and part six that's where i got my answer because part six says if they're gonna use a moon water they need a plan to like got the moon water and that's going to take time and money so it's not like tomorrow they can just call up a moan and bring a water it's like they have to spend all this money to do that and that's going to take for ever "
16877,530.1,Oliver,,,"i will show like the whole drinking water thing on the whole like breathing yeah um so that's really important but i guess i thought the question was just asking like if i thought it was a good idea like i convinced that we should i'm like all spend time on the water on the moon and so i wasn't convinced "
16882,530.1,Oliver,,,"yeah that's science so yeah Definitely. "
16886,530.1,Farrah,,,"well so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch i'm really sorry but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question because i had the same as student but i think my classmates convinced me that there's some some cool things you could use the water for and it was just really cool to listen to class so letting us do that "
16888,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah bye "
16892,530.1,Farrah,,,"hi miss carpenter it's good to see you today "
16894,530.1,Farrah,,,"yes we did "
16897,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me x shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16899,530.1,Luis,,,"oh well i like to watch a lot of videos like on youtube so i look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket oh it's so cool "
16901,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay "
16904,530.1,Luis,,,"um well actually our story it's on our tablet right in front of us so we can see it there "
16907,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah we have those too "
16911,530.1,Chris,,,"well i think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon "
16917,530.1,Farrah,,,"well i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16921,430.2,Farrah,,"but we want to explore a little bit further maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer and we want to go a little bit further we want to dig a little bit deeper ","yeah that sounds cool wd can do that yeah "
16923,430.2,Farrah,,,"it says that like in the first sentence they found evidence that there's water deep in the polar craters but student i don't know if it's like full of water but um it's in the craters "
16929,430.2,Jazmin,,,"i think the main point of part two paragraph two is like that nasa sent a small machine "
16931,430.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter lunar orbiter "
16934,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa and i saw that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that "
16939,430.2,Chris,,,"oh well if there were astronauts there soon yeah but maybe like you said doesn't let's say there were astronauts i "
16947,420.3,Oliver,,"can you find the sentence that student just talked about when it talks specifically about the lunar orbiter and please underline it or highlight it in your tablet that goes for all of you ","oh i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go through a loop story and look for the main points because that's really helpful for us we're looking for the answers for the questions so thank you so much for introducing that to us because i know we'll use it next time "
16949,420.3,Oliver,,,"thank you "
16953,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi how are you today "
16955,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16969,420.2,Chris,,"when you go back i want you both to reread the question to ask yourselves what kind of equipment is the question asking about what was the equipment used for where could you find that information in the text student you identified the main idea of this passage very good go back to the question and reread it please pay attention to the first half of the question and make a note of what kind of answer it's looking for think about restating the question in your answer if you get stuck and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help ","okay "
16971,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i was gonna say i don't understand why my answers wrong "
16975,420.1,Luis,,"your answer isn't wrong student i want you to expand your answer i want you to make it more detailed please be more specific than just a small machine ask yourself if someone hadn't read the passage that you read could they learn that information from your answer you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject so i want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question ","okay action word and question here we go "
16977,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay i'm feeling a little confused so you said to go back and look at the question and think about what the question was asking right "
16980,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon and so on well i said it was the microscope because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it you need a microscope to see it "
16985,420.1,Chris,,,"okay can do yeah so you told me to think about what or something about the question what did you say "
16989,420.1,Chris,,,"Yeah I did that. mm hmm and the the answer needs to be equipment and so well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16992,420.1,Chris,,,"well i mean if there's astronauts there they definitely need those things "
16995,310.1,Chris,,"they need things to even be in space i understand ","okay yeah i'll look for all look for some new stuff "
16997,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so you asked me to expand my answer and so while my answer was nasa send a small machine and so i found some more info it says nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter when land at the moon south pole and look for the ice to process "
17001,310.1,Farrah,,"that is very very very good student and i what i like about that is if i didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon and i had never read this passage i could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer ","so it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for giving each one of us a different thing that we needed to do to help improve our answer instead of just like telling us all to do the same thing because that helped us know that you really read our answers and knew how to help each one of us individually "
17005,310.1,Farrah,,,"all right yeah good to see you i can tell "
17007,310.1,Luis,,,"um i just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut "
17013,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay so i said water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
17015,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i think i found it oh oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft "
17017,310.1,Chris,,,"having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
17020,310.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah yeah i think that's important that they it's really heavy and so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's um that's important to "
17023,310.1,Jazmin,,"student what i really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts your own thought of maybe if they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well i like that you expanded your thinking ","so you can use water to grow things so we could have an moon garden on the moon "
17026,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well if there's water you need water to have plants like you they could grow food and they could make them really beautiful and so if there was water i think that's an opportunity that they would have to use the water "
17029,310.1,Luis,,,"yep sure can okay water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
17031,310.1,Luis,,,"i can't remember it sounds pretty cool "
17033,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay oh this is why this is why i picked this okay um it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel "
17039,420.2,Oliver,,"and i see how we've made the link between using the water to make hydrogen fuel and oxygen into something that the astronauts use very good The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and Luis for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text. What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion. ","Okay. well um so i said um it's not ready yet and it did say that it did say that on the story "
17042,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh okay so um and the last part it says i'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything because it's not ready yet and so i don't think it's that valuable because they need to spend all this time and money to make it to make it valuable "
17045,420.2,Oliver,,,"on yeah well cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money um so i don't think i don't think they should spend all their money on that because remember there's not even that much water there's like four cups you can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot "
17049,420.2,Oliver,,"student i love how you have said things that you've learned from the text to support your answer and that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon so i when i tell you to go back and finish up your work please use that evidence to support your answer ","before you before you talk to them and i'm so sorry it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say this was a really cool discussion because we got to hear so many different ideas and class had ideas that that had evidence to go with it and so that was really cool to see and hear their answers and their evidence so thank you so much "
17052,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
17054,420.2,Farrah,,,"we're good we're so excited for your class "
17060,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17062,420.2,Luis,,,"okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that "
17066,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay i can go "
17069,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17071,420.2,Oliver,,,"that was yeah that was me yeah i saw the same thing as student "
17073,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i can say that so well it's right there in the text and i know we have to find something in the text and well that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question "
17076,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i had a different answer and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17078,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yes okay well it's it's right there in part two and it says that nasa send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits and i think that means that that's how they found the water "
17082,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah definitely well the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too "
17085,420.2,Chris,,,"okay yeah well my answer is scientists found careers full of water on the moon "
17089,310.1,Chris,,"right okay good so i like all of your answers you all really clearly worked with the text to get to where you are ","okay yeah do you want us to reread it "
17095,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes okay well i i still think i still think that it's a small machine because in that part it says that they used it to investigate and that that word reminds me of discover so i still think that's the small machine "
17098,310.1,Chris,,,"well okay so here's the thing um i went to nasa and so when i was reading this it made me think i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17100,310.1,Chris,,,"oh oh well no i guess it's just when i read it it reminded me of going to nasa and i know that we have to say it whitman and so it made me think of that appointment "
17105,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay well i'm i'm getting a little confused because i said the microscope and when i looked back at the text it says the water is microscopic and so and so i'm thinking how can you discover something if you can't see it don't you need to see it through the microscope if you're going to discover it "
17112,310.1,Oliver,,"so i can see where you would say microscope ","oh yeah i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and and we have to go to lunch and i'm really bummed because i feel like we're just getting to the park but i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of her answers and and letting us know that you you could see why we got those answers on that really that really helped us feel good about our answers thank you so much "
17118,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17120,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay "
17126,310.1,Farrah,,,"Some, some time in English class. Yes, please do. "
17134,420.2,Farrah,,"so this sentence starter says the scientists used and then there's a line blank so this is where you would put the equipment that they used to discover that water is on the moon i found my answer in paragraph blank and this is where you're going to put the number there's a number at the side of the paragraphs and i want to know exactly where you found your answer okay does that make sense yes okay so well i start with student i want my friends i want you to start thinking about changing the wording of your answer okay just try your best that's all that matters ","yeah "
17137,420.2,Farrah,,,"Like out loud or just on my own. "
17139,420.2,Farrah,,"um you can do it on your own okay and i want you to start working on the sentence starter okay do you need me to read that to you ","know i just little confused because i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17145,420.2,Farrah,,,"that makes a lot of sense "
17149,420.2,Farrah,,"great i'm glad i'm so glad so if you could fill out this sentence starter for me ","okay i'll work on that "
17152,420.2,Oliver,,,"good i'm doing well i can try that sentence starter if you want "
17154,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon and i found my answer in paragraph three "
17156,420.2,Oliver,,,"thanks "
17159,310.1,Oliver,,"great job student i loved the way that you are flexible and change your thinking that made your answers so much better and i wanted to say student i loved in your first answer that you agreed with student because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking ","yeah well i just said what i said before because like something i don't want first like if i had gone first i would have said microscope but she had already saw that so i just said what i saw "
17162,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay "
17164,310.1,Chris,,,"well i'm sure because because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17166,310.1,Chris,,,"that would be pretty cool yeah "
17169,310.1,Chris,,,"Oh, so like the equipment has to be like in the story. "
17172,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah oh look oh look in the story again "
17177,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i i'm ready with my answer "
17179,310.1,Jazmin,,,"scientists used a small machine to discover the water and i found the answer in paragraph two "
17185,410.2,Jazmin,,"i love it student that is a great answer and thank you so much for using that sentence starter but someone who didn't read this text might not know what a small machine is ","yeah right "
17188,420.2,Jazmin,,"so your answer is right but i think that we should add a little bit more detail and describe is there maybe an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use ","oh oh it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
17193,420.2,Oliver,,"love it so student if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name that would be super helpful ","yeah actually are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much that sentence starter was so helpful and you really took you took the time to listen to every single one of us our answers and you just made us feel like like we've done a really good job and you helped us make our answers better to "
17197,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi it's nice to see you "
17200,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17209,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i mean that sounds kind of fun Yeah, so the question is looking for a piece of equipment that's what the answer needs to be "
17211,420.2,Oliver,,,"equipment is like something you use so could be like a tool or something "
17215,420.2,Jazmin,,,"we have to look in this story "
17220,420.1,Luis,,"and while i'm doing that i would like you to maybe reread the question and then reread the text see if or review your answer and see if your answer actually answers the question okay ","yeah "
17224,310.1,Farrah,,"so both of you found your answers somewhere in the text you were it was clear that you read the text and i really love that you were looking at the text you definitely read it or at least looked at it which is great ","Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I don't understand why that answers wrong. "
17231,410.2,Farrah,,"i'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer student so the way that you worded your answer didn't really restate the question ","Um the scientists Yeah. so the scientists need a tool called on microscope "
17235,420.2,Farrah,,"So how would you restate that question. ","um so the scientists used a scientific tool called a microscope "
17239,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay you want to have reread it Okay. "
17242,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah i know everything about space i watch all the videos on youtube all about space i pretty much know everything there is to know "
17252,420.2,Luis,,,"Yeah, so the question is what equipment that scientists do stuff discover water on the moon. In the story, on oh okay i should probably really read it "
17255,420.2,Chris,,,"okay yeah so this is kind of like what student said but i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17259,430.2,Chris,,"totally and and that's very helpful but i do want us to practice being that reading detective right so i want you to find your answer in the text because i want us to practice that skill is that ok with you ","yeah i guess i can do that "
17262,430.2,Oliver,,,"yep "
17266,410.2,Oliver,,"Sometimes we're then talking and I think it's incredible that you listened to her answer and you agreed with her. That's a really great skill. i am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything you just said i circled the same as savanna's that doesn't help me know if you understand the question or the answer ","Oh yeah. Well, I mean, I only said that because Farrah one but for me and like if I had gone. First I want to set it, but she went first. So if I had been first I would have said that the tool is a microscope. "
17269,410.2,Oliver,,,"Um, I would really like to. But actually, we have to go. All right, so, um, thank you so much for making us detectives that was really kind of made looking at the text and searching for answers, I'm seem really cool. "
17272,410.2,Farrah,,,"hi "
17274,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17279,410.2,Luis,,,"well yeah "
17284,410.2,Luis,,,"and protective caps on here we go "
17286,410.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah of course "
17289,410.2,Luis,,,"okay so it said what equipment to the scientists use to the spot or the water on the moon and so if there are scientists and they're all my own that gonna need i need a lot of things but they're definitely gonna need oxygen tanks yeah they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water "
17292,430.3,Luis,,"yeah absolutely and even i value all that information inside your brain and never lose that passion for space because it's amazing but i am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text i want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for the specific answer that you need do you want to try that ","um yeah i guess i probably be good if i read it "
17294,430.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah good for him "
17296,430.3,Luis,,,"he yeah "
17299,430.3,Luis,,,"okay "
17301,430.3,Jazmin,,,"um yes i'm ready "
17303,430.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine and i i don't understand why that's wrong "
17309,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i'm a little bit concerned that you didn't use a lot of detail i was wondering can you describe the machine at all are there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine ","oh well it says that the machine is small "
17311,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yet it's called the lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposit in the polar craters "
17316,420.2,Jazmin,,"oh my goodness student you just answered my next question my next question was going to be what does the machine do could you add a little bit more detail into your answer ","yeah oh okay so i should say i should say that in my answer should i should say lunar orbiter And what that week, my answer. That's spectacular. "
17321,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah uh huh "
17323,430.3,Oliver,,"I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right. So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words. ","no of course of course yeah i read it i hope you wrote that i love the text on my answer is that the tool is a microscope "
17325,430.3,Oliver,,,"yeah "
17328,430.3,Oliver,,,"and another one the microscope that's not it "
17331,430.3,Oliver,,,"oh okay i need to look for that because i thought a microscope and that's pretty important water's so small you need to see it "
17333,430.3,Oliver,,,"yeah okay "
17338,430.3,Chris,,,"actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say i know this time you didn't get to hear my answer but i heard class else and i know that you made class feel like their answer was really important and you understood why they said it but also you can help them make their answer spectacular and that that sounds really important "
17341,430.3,Farrah,,,"oh thank you hi hello "
17343,430.3,Farrah,,,"i'm mr stephen it's nice to meet you were doing good today "
17348,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah so i'm sorry sorry um we were just reading about the water the water on the moon and i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
17351,430.3,Chris,,,"yeah i can "
17353,430.3,Chris,,,"well it was about how they found water the phone craters are full of water on the moon "
17356,430.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i can add this is student "
17358,430.3,Jazmin,,,"well to find the water nasa send a small machine "
17362,430.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah i know this i know this event um it's the lunar orbiter it says that reading the story itself lunar orbiter mm hmm yeah student that's the name of it it's all lunar orbiter "
17366,310.1,Oliver,,"Thank you, Luis. Luis That was a really strong answer and I like how you reference the text, you said it's called the lunar orbiter because it says so right inside the text. ","well i learned that the water it's really really small it's so small because you need a microscope to see and yeah that was my answer that you need a microscope "
17371,310.1,Farrah,,,"um well i also sent them microscope like student and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17376,310.1,Farrah,,,"um i can do it i can do it i'm like you should have said i'm lunar orbiter because that's it that's what they said but but the text also talks about student it talks about the microscope to so you just i came not going to just change my answer as it talks about the microscope "
17383,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i think that's a microscope it says it says no said also machine how the lunar orbiter to investigate so which one is it "
17386,310.1,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17388,310.1,Chris,,,"um well "
17390,310.1,Chris,,,"well maybe maybe both "
17392,310.1,Chris,,,"well because i got some little story they say you need the lunar orbiter to investigate like student and student set but i guess also i mean if the water so small like student and student said then you need a microscope because how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it "
17396,310.1,Luis,,,"i have a question "
17399,310.1,Luis,,,"i don't think of microscope is right you class you class i don't think it's right because i think that in the lunar orbiter there weren't even astronauts there weren't even astronauts there right it was just the lunar orbiter like like an unmanned craft and so they wouldn't eat up microscope if there are like you know as a righty "
17402,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry that was student i should have raised my hand "
17406,310.1,Chris,,,"i think oh sorry it's student i think i think student might be right because well at nasa some of the spaceships they can go without astronauts but if it went with astronauts they probably knew the microscope but maybe they use the microscope like after "
17409,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers and talk about which one we thought was right because that really helped us think about what the article said so thank you so much "
17411,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good afternoon "
17414,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh you just said raised her hand um so i just wanted to say i'm having a really good day "
17416,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17424,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so i think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know because they found it "
17427,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so um student i agree partly like yes it's definitely about water on the moon but i think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon like it's only on these really small little bits "
17432,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay well so this on this connects to a student said student said the waters really small and this also connects to my answer so the scientists they had to use a microscope to find the water you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at it so um i guess i just i don't really understand why my answer is wrong "
17440,310.1,Chris,,"student thank you for sharing your answer and connecting with what others have said it seems like you're asking how come you didn't get full credit for your answer ","okay so um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17445,510.1,Chris,,"i like that you're connecting your background knowledge to help you it's great that you're using your notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use ","so the equipment from the story "
17447,510.1,Chris,,,"reach every reader let me look don't remember "
17450,510.1,Jazmin,,,"i found another piece of equipment in the story additional additional to the microscope and that was actually my answer and it's nasa sent a small machine "
17456,420.3,Jazmin,,"i like how you took your answer directly from the text it's great to read our answers directly in the text if you're not sure what to do you can always go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name ","for that piece of equipment okay yeah so it says on that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter "
17459,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah it says it student right next on what you said it says that the lunar orbiter investigates and looks for ice and the polar craters "
17464,310.1,Oliver,,"so you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly ","um excuse me yes student um we we have to go it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for really directing us to look back in the text and to find our answers in the text that was really helpful "
17466,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi we're excited to get started "
17470,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i just wanted to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
17473,430.2,Luis,,"it's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer i'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly but you provided evidence why don't you go back decide if you think water is valuable or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer ","okay you want me want me to read it again "
17477,430.2,Chris,,,"okay well um water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
17482,420.2,Chris,,"which is good because that provides more space that's a strong answer because it's rooted in the text i'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and ask why having more space on a spaceship is good ","Okay, yeah. Oh, I'll take a look "
17488,520.1,Jazmin,,"then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup your answers with reasoning i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this ","well i i got my answer just from from reading the text and i looked for evidence and another thing i did was i kind of thought about what made water useful so i'm drinking was one thing and another thing that i was thinking is that you could maybe use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the moon "
17493,520.1,Oliver,,"i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support your thinking And I'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future. I think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook. ","um well okay i'm student she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence and i think i did something similar but i actually came up with a different opinion so i think part of part of the question was having an opinion "
17498,420.1,Oliver,,"and that you clarified that this question is asking you for an opinion it's really good to be able to read a question and it's helpful to be able to read a question and understand what it's specifically asking you to do ","um yeah definitely okay so i said no there is not convincing evidence because i'm though the water isn't ready yet i mean it's not like you could just go to the moon today and i'm drink the water and plant a garden so i wasn't convinced because it said right there and part six it's gonna take a lot of time and money "
17500,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh i think maybe i'm that "
17503,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i think i would be convinced to maybe if it wasn't so hard to get the water and also from the first part if there was more water because it said there's only like four cups that's really not enough for all the astronauts to drink i don't think it's worth all the money "
17505,420.1,Chris,,,"oh well i just wanted to see i did i did what you asked and i looked for more reasons and i found out that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
17507,420.1,Chris,,,"um oh okay i'm oxygen and hydrogen could be used as rocket fuel "
17510,430.2,Chris,,"you're connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable i'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing and why can you tell me if this is good or bad and why ","oh it sounds pretty good to be like i'm extra rocket fuel that's probably really on like necessary when you're flying in space "
17514,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh well i really want to answer but we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you heard every single one of our answers and also understood where our answers came from and that just made us really feel that you were listening and that you cared about every single one of our answers so thank you so much "
17516,430.2,Farrah,,,"hi "
17519,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah we've all read it already "
17525,430.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
17528,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah that sounds great "
17531,430.2,Luis,,,"we read it we read it already "
17533,430.2,Farrah,,,"can i go first "
17536,430.2,Farrah,,,"i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17540,430.2,Farrah,,,"well the water on the moon the story said it's so small you can't see it "
17543,430.2,Farrah,,,"so they need to use the microscope so that they can see it so that you could look really closely at it "
17545,430.2,Farrah,,,"oh so before they can use the microscope they have to use something else "
17549,430.2,Farrah,,,"can look again yeah "
17551,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
17554,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17556,430.2,Jazmin,,,"let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
17558,430.2,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
17561,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so so i just had to say the name and then my answer would be right "
17565,430.2,Chris,,,"my answer was different because i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17568,430.2,Chris,,,"oh so i have to say the machine "
17572,430.2,Chris,,,"what they used so then i guess it's i guess it's the lunar orbiter "
17575,430.2,Chris,,,"okay so i just have to i have to make sure i i say the equipment okay "
17583,430.2,Oliver,,,"yeah well i hope the same answer i'll student about the microscope so i'm still totally sure why that's not right Well, I guess it's true observe "
17585,430.2,Oliver,,,"hey okay okay so they use the lunar orbiter to discover on the microscope to observe "
17588,430.2,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17591,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah i i also know that because i know a lot about space so i know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah i know that "
17594,430.2,Luis,,,"well because there's no oxygen is based on the astronauts would need them or else i couldn't breathe up there they need them to survive "
17597,430.2,Luis,,,"Uh huh, uh huh. "
17599,430.2,Luis,,,"okay "
17603,430.2,Oliver,,,"are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really help those understand that we needed to find not just like any old equipment but the equipment that was used to discover and you helped make that really clear for us so really thank you so much "
17606,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah that sounds great "
17608,430.2,Luis,,,"excuse me "
17610,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17612,430.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah that sounds awesome "
17616,420.1,Oliver,,"look at the question again you are going to find keywords or all the most important words in a question before you answer it pick up a pen or a pencil and i'd like you to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question ","okay yeah "
17620,420.1,Oliver,,"please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question ","yeah i think we're all ready "
17624,420.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i can share "
17627,420.1,Farrah,,,"so i thought the keyword the most important word was equipment because that word tells you that you're looking for like a tool for your answer "
17630,420.3,Farrah,,"Now you can use the words you circled ""equipment"" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there. Okay? ","yeah should i tell you my answer "
17632,420.3,Farrah,,,"um so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17636,420.3,Chris,,,"on so i said water because my answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon and the whole story is about water "
17639,410.2,Chris,,"yeah i really appreciate that you give us a fact from the passage when you answer the question you really gave us the evidence you found in a text the importance of water my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer ","yeah i guess no "
17641,410.2,Chris,,,"oh well okay so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17644,430.1,Jazmin,,"yes there are a lot of advantages but except for equipment please read the question again do you have other keywords like the action words in a sentence ","yeah actually maybe i can help student because my word that i picked was discover "
17647,430.2,Jazmin,,"but my concern is would you look carefully at the passage i think you have targeted the right place in the passage you just need to be a little more specific ","oh okay so well my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
17649,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah oh yeah that was in part two the small machine "
17651,420.2,Luis,,"yes so you class just need to be a little more specific what kind of machine was used to discover water ","oh i remember i remember from the story "
17653,420.2,Luis,,,"um it said it was a lunar orbiter nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate "
17655,420.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah he he read the whole sentence and so it said the name of the machine "
17657,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah that's what it says in the text "
17659,420.2,Oliver,,,"so it's it's time for us to go now but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us and being so specific which what with them with what each one of us could improve about our response on that really helped each one of us think about what our next steps could be free you can see "
17663,420.1,Luis,,"okay now please read the question again you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it ","um yeah i understand but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17665,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah sounds great "
17670,420.1,Farrah,,"okay now please read the question again you are going to find out the keywords all the most important words in a sentence to help you best to answer a question pick up a pen or a pencil and circle the words that you think are the most important in a question the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question ","yes yes i think we are finished "
17672,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh so the word i picked from the question but i thought was most important was equipment "
17676,310.1,Farrah,,"yes great i really appreciate that you are looking carefully at a question ","okay "
17680,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah well i picked the same as student because equipment and we also we also have the same answer too we work together a lot and both of us said it was a microscope because that's equipment "
17684,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i do because it's a scientific tool just like it says right there in part three microscope is a scientific tool um yeah so that's aw yeah the keyword "
17686,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i picked an action word i picked the word discover from the question "
17692,310.1,Oliver,,,"Yep. Sounds great. "
17694,310.1,Chris,,,"okay yeah so my answer to the question was scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17701,310.1,Chris,,"okay i really appreciate how you use facts and exact evidence from the passage when you answer the question ","well okay well it kind of goes along with my my keyword because i said the keyword was water and the whole story is about water and they found the water like all this water in the crater I hadn't hadn't heard of that just yet. "
17703,410.2,Chris,,"yes and so equipment is an important word in the question but you didn't include any equipment in your answer ","yeah i didn't include equipment i just said like where they found the water "
17709,420.2,Chris,,"yes so how will you revise your answer to include the equipment ","yeah i'll have to i'll have to put some equipment in my answer to make sure it answers the question Well, I went to NASA. So I know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. OK. OK. "
17711,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes "
17715,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh well what if i use the keyword like i could said i could say nasa sent a small machine to discover the water "
17720,310.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I like it. You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer. ","i'm so sorry i looked at the clock we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say this was so helpful thank you for for finding something good in each of our answers but also challenging us to look back on and reread for even more detail and even stronger answers that fit with a keywords that was a really helpful strategy "
17723,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you today "
17725,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're good thanks for asking "
17728,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i'm student my name is student oh sorry "
17731,310.1,Chris,,,"oh hi it's nice to meet you my name is student "
17734,310.1,Jazmin,,,"hi my name is student "
17736,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so my name is student and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17740,310.1,Farrah,,,"that's correct "
17742,310.1,Farrah,,,"i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17744,310.1,Farrah,,,"in part three it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small "
17748,310.1,Farrah,,"so i could see you how you got confused there ","well so that says right it says right after that you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i took that word right from the story "
17751,410.2,Oliver,,"right so you need a microscope to look at the microscopic particles because it's so small but that wasn't necessarily the tool that they used to send to the moon ","yeah i also thought it was a microscope because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment "
17754,310.1,Jazmin,,"right so i could see where that would get confusing ","I have a question. "
17756,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i understand why my answer as well "
17763,410.2,Luis,,"Teacher : You just forgot to use the second part of that term. ","oh well i just know a lot about space because i watch videos on youtube and i watch stuff about rocket launches and i really know a lot about astronauts so um i just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks "
17768,410.2,Luis,,,"so you're saying like because it's um it's not in the story i need to pick something from the story "
17770,420.2,Luis,,"right so i would like to see you use some context from the story to be able to answer that question does that make sense ","yeah i should probably read it "
17772,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay "
17775,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah so cool "
17777,420.2,Chris,,,"no no craters not equipment but that's where they've had to find the water "
17779,420.2,Chris,,,"oh well um i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like student was saying and masks and suits "
17785,410.3,Oliver,,"but if we look at the article right it doesn't mention oxygen tanks ","well um this is student i heard you say lunar orbiter i'm like i know you said that sorry to answer because you can told student but i still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from part three because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water "
17789,410.3,Oliver,,,"it's definitely small "
17793,410.3,Oliver,,,"well it lets you look at things that are really small Well yeah, I think. "
17796,410.3,Oliver,,,"i guess it doesn't say that nasa sent it "
17799,410.3,Oliver,,,"okay and part two i'm oh oh man oh i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and helping us find the right sentence and the text and looking for the right words to help us answer the question that's really helpful for us at this article and also for our next time "
17802,410.3,Farrah,,,"nice to see you "
17804,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i should be in this class i already know all about space "
17806,410.3,Luis,,,"ok ok "
17810,420.1,Chris,,"and i want you to underline or circle any keyword or any word that you think is important i'll give you a minute to do that ","i think we're ready "
17812,420.1,Chris,,,"well i said that the keyword was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon "
17816,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay sure yeah i had a different keyword from student and mine was on equipment "
17820,420.1,Farrah,,,"well because when it says equipment that means you have to look for like a tool for your answer and so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
17824,420.1,Luis,,,"well i also said equipment "
17826,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah i think for the same reasons that student and i know because i know so much about space i know there's so much equipment that you need and like you can't do anything without equipment so it just seems like really important you know "
17829,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i thought that the most important word in the question was discover "
17831,420.1,Jazmin,,,"well because that's sort of like the action like what they did "
17837,420.3,Chris,,"okay so i want you right now to reread the text or the article and i want you to circle any word that you might think is equipment is that clear ","yeah so me and student we're gonna reread it and circle all the equipment that we find is that right "
17839,420.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah because i went to nasa so i know that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17841,420.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah "
17843,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh no no question i'm going to read too "
17846,420.3,Oliver,,,"well we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine "
17848,420.3,Luis,,,"oh i know i know i know i know it's the lunar orbiter "
17851,420.3,Luis,,,"says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
17853,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
17855,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i guess i'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer but i guess i still think microscope is a good answer too "
17857,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh yeah well i just actually i wanted to say that it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for having us look at that question so closely today "
17862,420.3,Chris,,,"oh yeah yeah okay definitely so well we found the same to that student and student i guess because there's the small machine on the lunar orbiter and then at the end it talks about the microscope "
17864,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i just wanted to remind you my dad as actually an astronaut "
17868,420.3,Farrah,,,"huh yes it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
17871,420.3,Farrah,,,"i i thought it did because it's like how can you find something if you can't see it if it's too small for you to see how can you find it without something like a microscope huh "
17874,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah out loud "
17877,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17881,420.3,Chris,,,"Yeah, I can do that. Definitely. Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater. just right there or do you want me to keep going "
17883,420.3,Chris,,,"mm hmm yeah okay these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
17887,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm the one that student read i mean the one that student read yes yeah okay so it said that they sent the lunar orbiter and it looked at the moon and it found a water but it was actually ice and it was in the craters and there's like not that much of it "
17889,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah it was frozen "
17891,420.3,Farrah,,,"right yeah because it's so small like student was saying "
17893,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well my answer to begin with was the small machine so i still think that's right and i don't really see what was wrong with my answer nasa sent a small machine "
17896,410.2,Jazmin,,"right so you have the answer small machine my concern is is that there's a name for that small machine that you didn't mention ","oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter we've been talking about it like this whole time "
17902,410.2,Chris,,,"well yeah i agree with student i think would make sense that the lunar orbiter discovered it because i know from science class or a bit means to like go around so i'm picturing the orbiter like going around and around the moon and i can't really see how a microscope kind of fits into that so yeah i think that it saw the lunar orbiter and i was thinking i first thought it was these craters full of water but it sounds like there wasn't that much "
17905,510.1,Chris,,"student you are using your background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply your answer ","yeah exactly yeah because we learned that word orbit "
17907,510.1,Farrah,,,"it means to go around "
17910,510.1,Farrah,,,"the small pieces of ice "
17914,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah that's making more sense that the lunar orbiter is what like i'm a bit like detected it and then and then they used a microscope to like look at it and study it "
17917,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah that makes sense now "
17920,510.1,Oliver,,,"all yeah i sure can she said that on the oh i wasn't really listening i think it was thought on the lunar orbiter like found it and then the microphone all like looked at it "
17922,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i mean it's like close enough he couldn't he has to better words i think but yeah he got the idea "
17926,510.1,Oliver,,,"um well actually yeah i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to us and really helping us connect what we already knew like our background knowledge with the text and also helping us understand when we were using it to answer the question instead of actually using what's in the article in front of us that was so helpful thank you very much "
17929,510.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
17932,510.1,Luis,,,"yes me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17939,510.1,Oliver,,,"it says nasa sent a machine called all lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter these are still deposits are very small "
17943,510.1,Chris,,,"i was just raising my hand well they found the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17949,510.1,Jazmin,,,"and so sent a small machine "
17952,510.1,Jazmin,,,"that's what i said for my answer nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why the answer was wrong "
17959,410.2,Farrah,,"Remember, how I was saying that the point of these questions is to make sure we know that you know everything possible about this topic. So you gave us that step number one, but let's read the next step. ","yeah i can read it i'll do it now this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't to be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17962,410.2,Farrah,,,"well it was a microscope that was my answer "
17970,310.1,Luis,,"right i saw that man and you did a nice job of explaining that you actually took words from the text which is great ","i could do it i can do it oh you want me to do it put that put the answers together this is student "
17973,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so if you just put those the two the two things together it's like i'm on nasa sent a small machine and it was a lunar orbiter and then by looked at the small water with a microscope "
17976,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i would have to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17981,410.2,Chris,,"If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question. Does that make sense to you? ","so it's because it's not in the story "
17983,310.1,Chris,,"that's right yeah but again that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better it gives us almost like a little step ahead ","yeah yeah that's that makes sense yeah "
17985,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i'm wondering because i don't think about the lunar orbiter i don't think it had astronauts on it so did the astronauts did they need a microscope because if there weren't any astronauts they're not like walking around looking looking through a microscope on them right "
17991,310.1,Luis,,,"Oh, okay. So even though they didn't use it on the moon. It was like, they still had to use it like later. "
17994,310.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me must go on i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us understand how to put our answers together and make the most specific answer for the question we really appreciate that you taught us that today thank you very much "
18000,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18004,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i'll read it "
18007,310.1,Chris,,,"okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
18009,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay well i think the keyword as equipment because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question "
18013,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah sure okay i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18016,310.1,Jazmin,,,"So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
18025,420.3,Jazmin,,"so sometimes when we're answering a question even if we think that there's only one part we just need to be sure that we're reading through the text fully to make sure we don't miss any bit so why don't we try to combine those two answers ","well i think that it's a small machine that has to go first "
18028,420.3,Farrah,,,"on part three "
18030,420.3,Oliver,,,"i do have a question yes so i'm not sure i agree with student because what i'm thinking is if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope then how can you find it if you can't even see it "
18038,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh no that's okay that's okay you can keep going "
18040,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18047,420.2,Chris,,"and i love that you're using your background knowledge to connect to the texts always great it helps us understand text a lot more when we have that however when we're writing answers to comprehension questions about a text that was given to us we need to be sure that we're just providing information from the text when we provide information from our own background knowledge the issue is that we don't really have concrete evidence of where you got that information so even though i might know that you visited nasa if somebody else was reading your response and they didn't know that they might wonder where you got that information from to use evidence from the text in front of us ","so it has to be a piece of equipment from the story "
18049,420.2,Farrah,,,"well actually it's it's time for us to go right now but i wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer but we actually find the whole answer "
18055,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay um before i do that i just wanted to say um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18059,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon "
18063,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so i said that nasa send a small machine "
18066,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it's in part two "
18070,310.1,Farrah,,"mm hmm great so you have text evidence from the text that's great ","yeah so i picked a different piece of equipment and student picked and i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18074,310.1,Farrah,,,"that's it that's all we need to do "
18083,510.1,Oliver,,"so it's just a matter of combining your two answers so when we're answering comprehension questions like this we really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information ","oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope to if you put the two together i guess you just say on that the scientists used a lunar orbiter and a microscope "
18088,510.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah well before i do that i just wanted to say i'm student and student i think you're wrong i don't think i don't think they use a microscope because i mean i know it talks about it like sorry and stuff but can you can you even picture like if there was an astronaut and they weren't like walking all around that big giant moon what like a microscope like i can't imagine that "
18090,510.1,Oliver,,,"like i mean that's what i mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope because i don't think there were any astronauts there "
18096,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought that's kind of what i thought our first place that it was was most like that the lunar orbiter "
18100,510.1,Chris,,,"well surely so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i don't understand why why that's not the right answer "
18106,410.2,Chris,,"so those are all pieces of equipment absolutely however when we're answering a question to a text that we've read we need to be just using evidence from the text if we use background information the person who's reading your response won't know where you got that information for example i know that you went to nasa because you've talked about it however maybe student doesn't know that so if he was reading your response he may question where you got that evidence and if it's truly valid ","Okay, yeah. thanks for explaining got it "
18110,310.1,Oliver,,"no problem i like that you use the background information though student it's always great to have that helps us understand the text a little more ","what i wanted to try the thing you said where we put it all together and i'm use the words from the question "
18113,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay so equipment that the scientists used to discover the water was on the lunar orbiter then later like student said they used a microscope "
18115,520.1,Oliver,,"that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text ","thank you and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand how we each had like a part of the answer and how to put them all together and make the best awesome so to answer out there was "
18118,520.1,Farrah,,,"hi we're doing good thank you for asking "
18122,520.1,Luis,,,"well i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18124,520.1,Luis,,,"okay okay "
18131,520.1,Farrah,,,"well i think that a keyword is equipment because in your answer you need to have like a tool or something "
18140,420.3,Jazmin,,"let's revisit our text and figure out what specific equipment or scientific tool the scientists use in order to complete this mission ","so for my answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong after reading the text again "
18143,430.1,Jazmin,,"all right it's not that your answer is wrong particularly it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically so let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is ","And so it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter. "
18145,430.1,Jazmin,,,"i found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence "
18150,430.1,Oliver,,,"Well, Farrah, and we had a different answer when we talked about it. we said it was the microscope and they talk about that in the next paragraph how you would need a tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's also equipment "
18155,310.1,Chris,,"i love that you used you told me which paragraph you found that evidence right the more evidence that we have the stronger our claim is ","will own i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18157,310.1,Chris,,,"um oh oh well no not in this story but i just know that if there were astronauts they would need all of those things "
18162,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i'm thinking what student said it just made me think um i just reread the textbook as you told us to you know it doesn't say anything about astronauts student they don't even have the word astronaut and that story "
18168,420.3,Chris,,"yeah we're talking about the scientists right so it's great to make connections with our past experiences but also pay attention to what the question is asking and the context of the text ","i guess your i can try again because if i have to pick one from the story i would say i go so i would probably say what student said about the lunar orbiter because that sounds that sounds more like like a like a spaceship or something that they would send "
18170,420.2,Chris,," ","it says to investigate and to look for ice deposits "
18173,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm so sorry i just locked up a lot and we actually have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that our answers needed to have evidence from the text and the more evidence you have a stronger your answer is that's going to help us a lot with us close on also our classes too so thank you so much "
18175,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi it's good to see you today "
18181,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah well i was gonna say i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
18195,510.1,Farrah,,"i am going to give you some sentence starters and this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies Alright. So for example, I can start out saying I started out thinking And you would say your prior response. And now I think this way because And then you can tell me. So next time you see a question asking about a text I will do what. so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question ","yeah yeah we'd love to go first okay so um well we had the same answer originally so our our our answer for this has kind of the same show on we said "
18205,510.1,Farrah,,,"well what was the first part again i used to i used to think Okay, so we started out thinking that the answer was the microscope but now we think that the answer is the lunar orbiter be because oh well because well it kind of we talked about it and we heard that jazmin's answer was right "
18211,510.1,Farrah,,,"well it's because that they use the lunar lunar orbiter first and that's what they used to discover and then they use the microscope to study "
18218,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so well my first answer was nasa send a small machine but my new answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and i changed it because there wasn't enough detail so if i just say small machine it could be like anything like a like a toaster or a computer so next time i have a question like this i will look for all the details "
18224,510.1,Farrah,,"so why did you change your answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon ","i'm okay i would say next time i see a question like this i will look for or i'm look for evidence and the text "
18228,510.1,Chris,,,"can i go "
18230,510.1,Chris,,,"i want to know is my new answer okay my new answer is the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that okay "
18236,510.1,Chris,,,"nope nope nope nope nope nope student you didn't even say the equipment and that's like the whole point but that's the whole question oh yeah "
18240,310.1,Oliver,,"i love that you went and use a specific example from the text ","oh this is student i'm really sorry but actually we have to go and i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us think about how we got our answers and why we changed our answers because student and me we had just going to change that because we heard the right answer but now we heard more ideas for for how to find the right answer and the first place so thank you for that "
18245,310.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me i shouldn't be in that scrub i already corrected my answer "
18250,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay "
18258,520.1,Farrah,,"so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to your partner next to you and you're going to talk about what are your takeaway from the revision process And so the next time I see a question like this where I have to look at the text again I'm going to talk about a strategy. ","oh we can go first "
18263,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so well we had the same answer at the start so we we started out thinking that the scientists used a microscope to look really closely at the water and now now we think that the scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of on frozen water in the craters and we think that because well um so it was like we were told that the microscope wasn't right because they didn't use that first they used the lunar orbiter first but i don't really know how i would have thought of that on my own "
18271,310.1,Oliver,,"okay i appreciate your honesty i also really like that you are referencing specific parts of the text so i see that you said they were looking for ice deposits right in the large polar crater that's great ","yes so so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Oh yeah I got it. It's discover "
18275,310.1,Oliver,,,"all okay um it's it's what equipment to discover "
18277,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah can i try again "
18279,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so we used to think it was the microscope and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover so i guess if i was doing this again maybe i would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word "
18282,310.1,Chris,,,"oh okay well i want to know if my new answers okay so my new answer is the water the scientists found on the moon was microscopic "
18285,310.1,Chris,,,"They on they read the question and they found the action work discover "
18289,310.1,Chris,,,"so i said the water the scientists found was microscopic so i said like what it looked like when they discovered "
18295,310.1,Chris,,,"so so and what should i look for "
18300,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes student you want to look for equipment your answer nice to say equipment so it needs to have like a thing like an object in it "
18304,310.1,Oliver,,,"um excuse me um we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say that the way that you had us talk about why our answer changed on really helped us think about not just how to look at the text but also like how to look at the question and i think that's a really important first step so thank you so much for teaching us that today "
18306,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18308,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're good thanks for asking "
18311,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
18315,310.1,Luis,,,"well said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
18317,310.1,Luis,,,"no i just i just knew that because i watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like youtube and you know on the internet and stuff "
18321,420.2,Luis,,"but what i want you to do is i want you to look back at the reading that we did and try and find something from the reading that answers the question about what equipment the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","looking at now "
18326,420.2,Farrah,,,"i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18331,420.2,Farrah,,,"well they said it's really small so if you don't have the microscope you can't see it "
18342,420.2,Jazmin,,,"here yeah so i listened to the facts and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong i said that nasa scientists small machine "
18345,420.2,Jazmin,,"right so your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine but i want to see more detail i know that you could pull more detail from this what was the small machine called do you remember ","i think you just said it it's the lunar orbiter nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter "
18349,420.2,Oliver,,,"i get that they sent the lunar orbiter but i cricled the same answer as student and and i still don't i don't see why it's not the miscroscope because it sounds like they used that too right "
18351,420.2,Oliver,,,"it's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there and then and then use a microscope to like study it "
18353,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18356,420.2,Chris,,,"i think we know it's um well it's an orbiter so i guess that means like it goes around the moon "
18358,420.2,Chris,,,"was my answer my answer was that the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon "
18360,420.2,Chris,,,"lunar orbiter i guess "
18364,420.2,Oliver,,,"well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand the difference between what the lunar orbiter did and what the microscope did that was so helpful and now i understand what to look for in the text so i really appreciate it thank you so much "
18367,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18369,420.2,Farrah,,,"really good thanks for asking "
18372,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18376,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18378,420.2,Farrah,,,"so they talk about the microscope in in part in part three and they say the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it if you didn't have a microscope "
18382,420.3,Jazmin,,"oh student i see how you got that answer i see that you read the text and you were looking for different types of machines and tools they use but what i want you to do is go back to the text and look for a different machine that will allow the scientists to discover water on the moon ","i'm ready i'm ready to go "
18385,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18387,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine "
18390,420.2,Jazmin,,"great i can definitely see where you got that because they did send a small machine but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer what was this small machine called and what was it there to do ","okay so should i reread it "
18393,420.2,Chris,,,"can i go can i go "
18395,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18397,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well so the text is it's called water on the moon and so i figured the answer should be about the water on the moon and they found it in the craters like these critters full over water "
18400,420.3,Chris,,"what i want you to do now is go back to the text and look for a specific piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon ","Okay, looking for equipment. Gotcha. "
18402,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm i'm i'm feeling confused i had the same answer as student and i still i don't understand why you told her to look again because i think a microscope it's the correct answer "
18404,420.3,Oliver,,,"well how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
18408,420.3,Oliver,,"okay i see i see where you're coming from because you definitely would need a microscope to discover something that's too small to see Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use. So I want you to go back and try and find that machine. ","okay i'll do my best "
18411,420.3,Luis,,,"ah i said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks "
18413,420.3,Luis,,,"well i mean since i know so much about space i just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff "
18417,420.3,Chris,,"right so you were thinking about your own knowledge that you have and what scientists would need if they were on the moon so that's awesome but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon okay ","yeah well what student said it reminded me that i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like even said and masks and suits "
18420,420.3,Chris,,,"oh like the stuff they say in the story "
18423,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so every night there's like there's two there's two equipments i see this small machine which student was talking about and i see the microscope too "
18427,420.3,Chris,,,"oh it doesn't really say the word discover but if i had to guess i'd say i probably guessed the orbiter it sounds like that's more of a robot kind of thing that might be able to detect the water "
18430,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh i'm really sorry i we have to go but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us "
18433,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi "
18435,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah we all we all took some time and we read it again "
18438,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i can share "
18441,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so you told me to look again and see if i can add more details to my answer and i found more details in part two which is where my answer came from and so i would say nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter which will land at the moon south pole and look for is deposits in the craters "
18444,310.1,Jazmin,,"wow student good job looking back at the text and adding more detail ","oh no not really i just added more details "
18447,310.1,Jazmin,,,"because there was more information that i didn't put in "
18451,530.1,Oliver,,"does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer ","okay um so i thought the microscope it was the right answer and now well now i know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really know how i would have known that i'm without without student telling us "
18453,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon okay so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon "
18456,530.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'll look "
18461,530.1,Chris,,"great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed ","okay well i was i was thinking about a lot of stuff about nasa and the different types of equipment and the craters and stuff but you reminded me that the answer well it has to be equipment and it has to be in the story so i guess if i were to try again i would pick out a piece of equipment on like the lunar orbiter "
18465,310.1,Oliver,,"but i like that now you're thinking about how you would look through the story to figure out the question that it was asking ","okay so um i think a part that you're talking about is the part in part two where it says about looking for the ice deposits because i guess the water was not just water it was ice and they found it as ice ice form "
18467,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater "
18470,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay so in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine "
18473,310.1,Oliver,,"good work paying close attention to the details of our story ","yeah okay i think i'm i think if i if i just read it more carefully next time i maybe i could find the right answer "
18478,530.1,Luis,,"good work paying close attention to the details of our story i think just paying close attention to those small details is really important good job does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading ","yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter maybe they use a microscope who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks "
18481,530.1,Luis,,,"okay why did scientist us to discover why "
18483,530.1,Luis,,,"okay well well they were using the oxygen tank star for you "
18487,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah yeah i see what you mean now "
18490,530.1,Oliver,,,"um well it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say that the way you asked us to think about how our answer changed like what we used to think and now what we think that really helped me at least understand how i could go from a wrong answer to to a more a more right answer i think i'm going to use that next time too so thank you so much "
18494,530.1,Farrah,,,"hello hi it's good to see you i'm unable to see and hear you at this moment i think you might have frozen can you repeat what you said you had frozen "
18496,530.1,Farrah,,,"that's okay "
18499,530.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18501,530.1,Luis,,,"okay i love talking about space "
18506,530.1,Farrah,,,"well i read it i read the whole thing but that was the piece of equipment that i thought because a microscope is like a tool "
18509,530.1,Farrah,,,"and so that's why i thought it was the answer because in the text oh i remember one thing i remember is isn't the water is really small it's so small it's microscopic and that's why you need the microscope to see it i remember that "
18513,530.1,Jazmin,,,"well i said that nasa sent a small machine "
18515,530.1,Jazmin,,,"it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
18518,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um well i think it looks for the for the water "
18521,530.1,Chris,,,"was my answer that's what i said that the scientists found craters full of water "
18523,530.1,Luis,,,"oh i know the answer to this one i know "
18525,530.1,Luis,,,"if ice it was ice "
18528,530.1,Farrah,,,"i got that there was the lunar orbiter and stuff but i still don't understand why my answer was wrong "
18531,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh ok so it's both "
18533,530.1,Farrah,,,"okay "
18535,530.1,Farrah,,,"did they use them did they use the microscope to on to see the water because i feel like i feel like you have to see it before you can discover it and that was the word and the question discover but i feel like you have to see it first "
18540,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh like so tiny you can't even see it "
18543,530.1,Oliver,,,"i heard what student said but i don't think he was right i think i think it was awesome student said full of water but i think it's so small cause i also said a microscope like student "
18548,530.1,Chris,,,"they were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18554,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i guess i was picturing like all this water but really it was just like like a little little ice deposits exactly okay that's different than what i thought in my mind Yeah. makes a lot of sense "
18556,530.1,Jazmin,,,"yes a small machine "
18558,530.1,Jazmin,,,"what it says then you start to investigate that's the word they use in paragraph two "
18560,530.1,Jazmin,,,"just because they use that word in the sentence they say they say nasa sent a small machine so i was just i was using that word because it was in the story "
18564,530.1,Jazmin,,,"it's called it's an orbiter and that makes me think that it like it goes in orbit like like it's kind of goes around the moon because we learned in science that that's what it means "
18569,530.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me yes i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and for helping us talk through all of our answers because like you said sometimes we have to talk about it to help us kind of like think about what we were thinking in our head and hear what other people were thinking in their head and so it was really helpful just to talk about our answers with you today "
18571,530.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
18573,530.1,Farrah,,,"well this is just a guess but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it but not all of it "
18576,310.1,Luis,,"yeah i like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew ","um yeah well i should be being in this class i already know all about space "
18585,420.3,Luis,,"and then what we're going to do is we're going to read through what we read before but this time we're going to do some close reading and we're going to make some annotations on our work so today what would i want you to is underline where your partner found their answer and something that you think you could add to their answer to make it a more complete answer ","yeah i think so so we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers "
18587,420.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay "
18591,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay student said well we actually had the same answer which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope "
18593,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh well no not really i mean we have the same answer and i guess i still don't understand why that answers wrong "
18595,420.3,Farrah,,,"sure "
18602,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i guess it talks about how the lunar orbiter was looking for ice and how there's not that much of it like it's really small "
18605,410.3,Oliver,,"I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water ","Okay, yeah. You want both of us to look at that again and I will look up part two for more tools. "
18610,410.3,Luis,,,"uh huh yeah we were working all together the three of us "
18612,410.3,Luis,,,"okay i looked at on jazmin's answer and she said that nasa sent a small machine "
18614,410.3,Luis,,,"well i was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks because that was my answer and i'm student was talking about how he wants to nasa and so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff "
18619,410.3,Luis,,"i'm really glad that you that this class was able to make some real world connections based on your past experiences that's a really good skill to be able to have what i'd like you to do though is look a little bit closer in the reading so as you're reading and you're making those real world connections i want you to also find what exact things what details are in the reading that show what tools they used so even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks that's not specifically in the reading ","Oh ok ok so cuz it's because it's not in the story. That's why it's not a whole answer. "
18621,410.3,Luis,,,"oh ok i see that make sense "
18625,420.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question ","okay well i looked at chris's answer he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i think that's not quite a whole answer because he doesn't actually say anything about equipment "
18628,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah actually i wanted to just say it's time for the next class but thank you so much because you really hope to think about what makes a partial answer and the fact that we could keep on going back to the text and look for more to make our answer more complete "
18634,420.3,Jazmin,,,"student student and he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18636,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh well i wasn't quite sure because when i was looking at it it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water but maybe he was thinking about the craters like in part one it says craters "
18638,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i just have something to say and that's i just wanted to remind you and also you do that my dad is actually an astronaut "
18640,420.3,Luis,,,"okay "
18646,420.2,Jazmin,,"i see how you saw in the reading that they called them craters but there was only a little bit of water So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you. ","oh ok "
18649,420.2,Chris,,,"he looked at luis's answer and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff but it sounds like that's not really the right answer "
18651,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah well so here's the thing so we were talking about it because we both know about space but then when i looked at the at the story again it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really "
18656,310.1,Chris,,"where we found that from is from outside now so that's what's called like texts to real world connections so that's a really good skill to have ","right yeah so that was more like jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine Oh well. Okay. Hello, like it says that the lunar orbiter will land up the South Pole and look for ice deposits. So maybe we could say the lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits. "
18660,420.2,Chris,,"yeah i see how you're using the text and rereading and finding more information that's really great so i'm going to suggest that your class keeps looking through and looking at each other's answer and seeing what you could add to each one individually ","okay okay "
18662,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay well um before we have said down microscope and i think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right but there was one other tool and that was the lunar orbiter "
18665,420.2,Oliver,,,"to paragraph two like the first sentence of it "
18671,420.3,Oliver,,"so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading you're able to see where you found your answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it now that you've been able to add to your answer i'm going to suggest that you look again at where you found your first answer ","yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope "
18673,420.3,Oliver,,"Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different. ","okay so reread part three yeah okay got it "
18675,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah we found those two pieces of equipment yeah the lunar orbiter and the microscope and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water "
18679,420.3,Farrah,,"for you student what i want you to do is try looking at paragraph two and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that ","okay i'll look at that "
18685,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so um i don't know where student got his answer because if you read the story it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything it just says they were there was water like deep in the craters and so i would fix chris's answer i would say um that the scientists they found only a little bit of water and it was actually ice and they found it in the craters with on the lunar orbiter "
18691,310.1,Oliver,,"so I can definitely see where he found his answer, but other than that. ","oh god i'm so sorry to have to say that i looked at the clock and we really have to go on a launch now but i went on to say this was so helpful because you helped us on think about like how to keep thinking about our answer and keep going back and see why is this the best answer or why is something else the best answer and so by looking at the text again and asking ourselves questions that's going to help us make sure we have a fall and not a partial answer "
18693,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good afternoon "
18696,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh it was so cool "
18699,310.1,Luis,,,"well excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18703,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine "
18705,310.1,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
18708,310.1,Chris,,"good i like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information good job ","i'll share can i share "
18710,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well "
18714,310.1,Chris,,,"scientists found craters full of water on the moon They're like big on the kind of hard to describe. But it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground. I don't know. They're hard to describe. "
18716,310.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah that's a good description too "
18720,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18726,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay well actually i had the same answer i student and so i found out in paragraph three and if you look there and says the water they found as microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope so i think that's what they use because you have to see something if you are going to find it "
18731,310.1,Oliver,,,"To investigate. Let me look for that water in the story well it says investigate in part two "
18734,310.1,Oliver,,,"So you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first. After that, on the astronauts to use the microscope, just see it. "
18737,310.1,Chris,,,"yo well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18744,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i actually i do because i know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something and so i'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story so like if there weren't even astronauts they wouldn't really need a microscope the astronauts walking around the whole moon holding a little microscope but that's kind of funny to think about "
18750,310.1,Chris,,,"maybe they'll send astronauts back after "
18752,310.1,Chris,,,"get the water "
18757,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just want to say thank you so much for helping us understand how they use the different equipment and to look for that word investigate to find the best piece of equipment for the for a question but also knowing how they use like all the other kinds of equipment that we had also said and that really helped us feel like our answers where we're good an important one also know what the right answer was so thank you so much "
18760,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you "
18763,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18767,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something "
18771,310.1,Luis,,,"well it's like um maybe i mean they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water but they would need to have oxygen tanks on if there were astronauts there because otherwise they couldn't even get to discovering the water because they wouldn't have any oxygen and they wouldn't be alive and they couldn't discover the water "
18776,410.2,Luis,,"absolutely that is correct if there were astronauts there they would need oxygen but the oxygen tanks wouldn't be a tool to discover the water ","Um, yeah, okay, I'll read it. Yeah. "
18781,410.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
18784,420.3,Jazmin,,"so i think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text ","okay "
18786,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah i knew i was looking for equipment and so that's why i found the microscope "
18789,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i mean how could you discover something if it's too small to see you have to be able to see to find it "
18794,420.3,Farrah,,,"you want me to read it again or well i mean i heard student talk about the small machine and stuff "
18798,420.3,Chris,,,"Yeah, okay. So I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also masks and suits. "
18801,420.3,Chris,,,"oh i don't think it's the word astronaut like and me were "
18805,410.2,Chris,,"but the text doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water ","Oh, okay. So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft. Oh, I learned that word at NASA to "
18809,410.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so you said i have to look for more detail and so i found about this machine a few things so first it said that it was called the lunar orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters "
18812,310.1,Oliver,,"good i like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us ","on so it's our it's time for us to goal right now but i wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about that really made us feel like you heard us and could help each and every one of us "
18815,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're good today how are you "
18817,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18819,310.1,Luis,,,"i do "
18827,420.3,Luis,,"why don't you take a quick minute and think about that you can go back in the text and let's see if we see anything that says that oxygen tanks were an equipment used to discover the water ","Okay, yeah, I'll read it. "
18831,310.1,Jazmin,,"now let's see some other answers student i really liked that you noticed that nasa had sent a small machine ","like about the machine or about other equipment "
18833,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes yeah so that was my answer yeah "
18837,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Yeah. so yeah so i found it in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it will land at the mood south pole and look for ice deposits and the polar crate "
18843,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess i could put more more like from the text so i could add like the name and how it works "
18845,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi um i don't understand why my answers wrong "
18847,310.1,Farrah,,,"so they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the the really small water with the microscope "
18851,310.1,Farrah,,,"is this about like how there's no astronauts so they need a machine "
18853,310.1,Farrah,,,"student was talking about that machine that looked in the craters "
18860,420.1,Oliver,,"yes good and so just like i mentioned to student is we want to make sure that we're reading our whole question ","um yeah okay i think i can help student out because remember how like if there aren't astronauts then who would even be holding the microscope because like i picked that same answer to but now i see that like yeah you said you can't just send a microscope to the moon you have done something first "
18863,420.1,Oliver,,,"um so it has to be that lunar orbiter yeah i thought i was the microscope to student but now i changed my mind "
18869,310.1,Oliver,,"i think that's a great point though student is when we go back and we look into our texts and we remember our question we might better analyze what the question is actually asking us So I really liked that you went back in and saw some details, Oliver. ","oh it's time for us to go to lunch i'm so sorry this was really fun class but i just wanted to say on before we go thank you so much because you helped us see whether our answers actually connected to the question arm and that's why i changed my answer because i realized it didn't actually answer the question thank you so much for helping i see that "
18872,310.1,Farrah,,,"good morning "
18874,310.1,Farrah,,,"it's nice to meet you "
18877,310.1,Farrah,,,"about about water on the moon "
18881,310.1,Luis,,,"well excuse me this is student i should i and i already know all about space "
18885,310.1,Farrah,,,"well it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and the different the tool that they had to use when they found the water "
18887,310.1,Farrah,,,"and my answer was the microscope that they use the microscope "
18890,310.1,Luis,,,"well i was just saying i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
18895,310.1,Luis,,,"oh i know a lot about space because i watch all sorts of youtube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff and so for the question i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they have to have the whole of rocket ship and everything that they need to prepare for that oh it's so cool to watch rocket launches and to learn about all the astronauts i just i really love space "
18905,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes so i saw that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18912,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i read paragraph two where it says nasa nasa nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i said a small machine "
18916,420.3,Farrah,,"When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question. ","yes it's right here on our tablets "
18920,420.3,Chris,,,"or you went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff "
18928,310.1,Oliver,,"i love that and i love how just like student you're using previous knowledge and you're making connections and it's so important ","i just looked at the clock and we have to lunch now i'm really sorry because this cost was really fun but i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that we really have to use the words that are in front of us and the story in front of us and and not just all the things that we already know like like student and student but we also have to use that story and use what it tells us when we answer the question that was really really helpful thank you so much "
18931,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18933,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh great how are you "
18936,310.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah so um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18938,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
18941,310.1,Luis,,,"um i said i'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
18944,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i said nasa sent a small machine "
18947,310.1,Chris,,,"and my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18950,310.1,Oliver,,,"so i circled the same as student and we both thought it was the microscope "
18952,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i mean i mean we both just thought if the same answer i mean so i thought the microscope and she thought our microscope um yeah "
18955,310.1,Farrah,,,"um well my my full answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18959,310.1,Oliver,,,"well some of us are right and some of us are wrong "
18962,310.1,Jazmin,,,"maybe up there's more than one answer "
18966,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay that sounds good "
18980,310.1,Jazmin,,,"we know who our partners i think we're ready to go "
18987,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay okay "
18989,310.1,Farrah,,,"i think we're ready i think we're ready to go "
18991,310.1,Farrah,,,"on we we can move on but i promise the right people are working together "
18994,310.1,Farrah,,,"you said it was my turn first "
18998,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah exactly "
19001,310.1,Farrah,,,"yes i found it in in paragraph three on it some where they talk about how the waters microscopic "
19004,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19008,310.1,Farrah,,"very good and i love that answer because i can see that you noticed that the sentence had a scientific tool in it ","yeah exactly i know that a microscope is a tool "
19011,310.1,Oliver,,,"teacher "
19014,310.1,Farrah,,,"Okay, read and look for a signal. "
19016,420.3,Oliver,,"yes so reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment okay and it's okay for you to circle some words that might help ","um yeah i'm really sorry but it's time for us to go actually um but i wanted to say i wish we'd all gotten to work with you and hear your your individual on comments cuz it sounded like you had a really good idea of how to help student "
19020,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh hi miss teacher we're back "
19022,420.3,Farrah,,,"great we're excited to keep going "
19024,420.3,Farrah,,,"yes i did "
19026,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i didn't work with a partner yet i just rewrote it and i found that they talked about a machine "
19028,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
19030,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i can do that "
19034,420.3,Oliver,,,"no i think that sounds good "
19036,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah um so my answer is the microscope "
19038,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay well um it said a piece of equipment and a microscope is equipment and you need it to look at the water "
19044,310.1,Oliver,,"i love how you identify the microscope as a scientific tool ","not yet i'm i right now i mean i know what the microscope is a tool "
19046,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah um there's definitely other things like i was working with student and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks "
19048,310.1,Oliver,,,"no no because um i don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water "
19050,310.1,Oliver,,,"well you don't use them for discovering you just use them for breathing "
19052,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound "
19055,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh what were you saying "
19059,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay you want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now "
19062,420.3,Chris,,"you can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two ","Isn't my turn. "
19064,420.3,Chris,,,"student oh sorry student i figured i was next "
19066,420.3,Chris,,,"okay "
19070,420.3,Chris,,,"sure so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and that connects to what student was just talking about so i wanted to share it "
19072,420.3,Luis,,,"sweet "
19074,420.3,Luis,,,"oh it must be it must be student "
19076,420.3,Luis,,,"oh so it's student and so i don't know "
19078,420.3,Luis,,,"okay it was um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
19080,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah it was student he said he thought my answer was wrong but i definitely don't agree "
19082,420.3,Luis,,,"well if there's astronauts on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
19085,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah the microscope "
19087,420.3,Luis,,,"um now i mean maybe they used it but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it but um i think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important okay "
19089,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah what equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
19098,420.3,Oliver,,"and find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or i guess i can help you ","oh yeah nice teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but um i wanted to say having us and listen to each other's answers was really interesting because like you said it sounds like there's a lot of different tools the astronauts use it was really fun to hear all about them "
19102,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi hi nice to see you "
19105,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me excuse me this is student "
19111,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah we've all bought it on our tablets "
19115,420.3,Luis,,,"oh okay "
19117,420.3,Farrah,,,"i think we're all ready "
19120,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19126,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh i'm sorry i was raising my hand "
19129,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah cuz i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine "
19131,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh "
19133,420.3,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
19136,420.3,Chris,,,"when i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19141,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm still a little confused actually "
19143,420.3,Oliver,,,"um i understand what you're saying cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer but i had the same answer also student and i guess i'm just not sure like how i would know that my answer is wrong without without you telling us it's the lunar orbiter "
19148,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh yeah well i was thinking like how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it "
19152,420.3,Oliver,,,"i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why i'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question um so thank you so much "
19156,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you we're we're all doing well "
19160,420.3,Luis,,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space. "
19167,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well i think the action word is discover "
19176,420.3,Farrah,,"yeah you're exactly right student so i want us to go back and reread the text and i want you to look for the action word discover because i think that will lead us to the answer as to what equipment was used to discover water on the moon Let's see if we can find a new equipment that maybe we didn't write for our answer. ","okay so i'm sorry alright so i think that thought well so i couldn't find the word discover in the story but i think that in order to discover the water that you'd need to find you need the microscope because how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
19179,420.3,Farrah,,"oh student you're absolutely right the word discover isn't here but i want you to look actually i'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for discover ","Okay. "
19184,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well so the word that's kind of like discover is investigate and i found my answer in the same sentence as that word i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19189,410.2,Luis,,"student nasa did send a small machine but you if you read on in that sentence there's a name for that small machine that you didn't use in your answer ","yep yep i totally got this one it is the lunar orbiter student that's right there and the story i can't believe you didn't get the name that's all right there "
19197,420.1,Chris,,"but friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us ","yeah oh hi i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19204,420.3,Oliver,,"so we have to really read our texts carefully and look at the keywords ","Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer. "
19207,420.3,Farrah,,,"we're good thank you for asking "
19210,420.3,Luis,,,"um i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
19221,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so look for the word valuable okay and i only found it in one spot at the very beginning where it says water on the moon would be a valuable resource so it sounds like the answer is yes "
19226,420.3,Oliver,,,"evidence is like something from the story the part of the story that you bought your answer from "
19229,420.3,Jazmin,,"That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource. So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability. ","well i got a new idea when i read it for the second time and so my new idea is that you can use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the womb "
19239,420.3,Luis,,"Why is water, an important resource the texts will say it for us if we read on. So I want us to go back into the text. i want us to look for explicitly stated examples in the text ","my example as water can be broken down into two parts oxygen and hydrogen "
19243,420.3,Luis,,,"um okay yeah so um it's valuable because i'm so it can be broken down into hydrogen oxygen and then oh um okay so astronauts could breed the oxygen i mean of course and then oh oh this part is so cool okay oxygen hydrogen could be used for rocket for your wall "
19247,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh okay so i was thinking something a little different and it's still from the text there's still evidence so it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i think that it wouldn't be valuable for a long time "
19252,420.3,Oliver,,,"well i was thinking about another meaning of the word value like i'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money so i was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money "
19260,420.3,Oliver,,,"i wish we had time to hear another answer but actually we have to go to lunch but this is a really fun class i don't want to end what thank you because you really helped us think about using evidence evidence from the text in order to answer the question and also you helped us know how to make a complete answer like if you read a little further sometimes and you add more detail your answer can be better and make a lot more sense "
19263,420.3,Farrah,,,"good morning good morning "
19265,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh well you're good thank you for asking "
19269,420.3,Luis,,,"what excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19271,420.3,Luis,,,"oh ok ok ok that makes sense "
19273,420.3,Luis,,,"so does that mean like i'm like you have to use a word from the story "
19276,420.3,Luis,,,"Oh, okay. That makes sense. Yeah. "
19280,420.3,Farrah,,,"i said scientists used a microscope to look really closely "
19283,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah so it's on paragraph paragraph three it says scientists need a scientific tool called a microscope because the water the water is so small "
19287,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i said that that's the scientists nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19294,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah um so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
19298,310.1,Oliver,,"thank you see that was a much more detailed answer you just added more detail to your first answer so you wasn't wrong you just added more detail to show your understanding thank you for that student ","um yeah it's student and i i have the same answer as student also found out about the microscope and so is it a microscope or or is it one machine called the lunar orbiter which one is it "
19302,310.1,Oliver,,,"well a microscope is a tool like equipment like it says in the question "
19305,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah so i have the same answer student and i thought it was the microscope so oh but you said also lunar orbiter and i'm i don't know why it doesn't microscope because microscope is also equipment "
19308,310.1,Chris,,,"well i'm point to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19315,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so since since story didn't talk about those things then it's not the right answer Home. Okay. Okay. "
19319,310.1,Oliver,,,"on what actually are two o'clock and we left a good lunch what i wanted to say thank you for really reminding us that we had to use evidence from the text that was so helpful and i know it's going to help us with all our questions in the future so thank you for reminding us and being so patient with us today "
19322,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi it's good to see you "
19326,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19334,420.1,Farrah,,"i would like for you class to think about that question and the question i would like for you to think what is the most important parts of the question that you need to know in order to answer the question specifically with what it's asking so what words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question so what words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question ","okay so i think that you should focus on the word equipment because that tells you that the answer it has to be like a thing or a tool "
19338,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so i picked a different word and i thought that the most important word was water because that is really what the story is about water on the moon "
19340,420.1,Chris,,,"so there are these craters full of water on the moon and the scientists discovered it because they used to think there wasn't water but now they know that there is "
19346,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay my answer is that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19351,420.2,Jazmin,,"When they read our answer to the question, they should, they should be able to know what it is we're talking about. They should be able to learn something. So, yes. you were on to the right path of getting to the answer that nasa sent a small machine they did but can you tell me more about the machine can you be more specific while using evidence from the text something to support your answer what type of machine was it ","okay i can try okay so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it lands at the moon south pole and it looks for the ice deposits in the craters "
19355,310.1,Farrah,,"and I'm sure if someone who has never read this informational texts before if they read your answer. They would be able to learn something, because he was very specific in describing what the machine was and what it did. Thank you. Jazmin. ","okay um my answer was different from jazmin's i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19357,310.1,Farrah,,,"so there's this part on part three and it says the water is microscopic so how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it that's why i thought you'd need the microscope "
19364,420.1,Farrah,,"it's very important to know what is being asked so when you know what's being asked of you you'll have a more clear understanding of how what your answer and how you should answer ","yeah okay that makes more sense okay "
19366,420.1,Chris,,,"so i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19369,420.1,Chris,,,"oh no but we were just talking about the equipment and so that made me think of that and i thought probably they would have to use those things too don't you think "
19371,420.1,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm really sorry but we have to go i wanted to say before we go thank you for really helping us understand the question and the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was "
19374,420.1,Farrah,,,"hello again "
19377,420.1,Luis,,,"Um, I just wanted to remind you, my dad and actually an astronaut. "
19384,420.1,Jazmin,,"What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence. ","okay i would say an important part of the question is the word evidence "
19386,420.1,Jazmin,,,"well i think it means that you can't just like think of something on your own but you have to read what's in the story "
19390,430.2,Oliver,,"yes we have to read what's in the story when we answer the question of support and that we use what we read in this story to support our answer we don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable you want to use the text for our answers ","I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer. They won't be convinced. "
19394,430.2,Farrah,,,"is it valuable "
19396,430.2,Farrah,,,"i think we need to come up with reasons why the water would be like important that's another meaning for valuable "
19402,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well i have a few things to say so my first answer was it was let me look at it again okay so my first answer was yes and uh my evidence from the text is that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and then the more i thought about it like thinking about valuable like convincing reasons it would be valuable i was also thinking that you could use water to grow things and you could have a garden on the moon "
19407,430.2,Jazmin,,,"no it talks about the drinking drinking water but i guess i was just thinking about why water is valuable because student was just talking about that word and that's what made me think about the garden "
19410,420.2,Chris,,"that's very true what you said but as i said earlier we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked we don't want to talk about things that are not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing yes student ","okay i have an idea and it's that that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
19412,420.2,Chris,,,"in part two "
19415,420.2,Chris,,,"oh okay here it is um so they need oxygen the astronauts need oxygen "
19417,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i know there's i know there's i know there's i know this "
19419,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah i'm student you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel "
19425,420.2,Farrah,,,"Well, I would say. that you can look at the most important words in the question Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story. "
19427,420.1,Oliver,,"when answering the question we want to look at important words ","i'm not but i have something else to say "
19431,420.1,Oliver,,,"no i was done um well i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just i really appreciate how you taught us how to take a question apart and how you also taught us to really look for evidence that our answers they have to come from the text "
19435,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i you know i really got this figured out i think i'm all good "
19437,420.1,Luis,,,"um i meant more like i have it figured out like i can go back to my seat "
19440,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah so you can take water and you can split it into two parts you can make oxygen and hydrogen "
19442,420.1,Luis,,,"well because you can have those chemicals "
19444,430.2,Luis,,"yeah i agree that you can do a lot with those too so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence but didn't explain why that's so valuable so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals ","oh like what you can do with them yeah yeah okay i can do that "
19446,430.2,Oliver,,,"yeah we always work together "
19448,430.2,Farrah,,,"i just we're kind of friends but kind of not "
19453,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable like 50 years in the future or i don't know at some point in the future but we were thinking that because this question was like is there convincing evidence that water is valuable and we we thinking like no it's not valuable yet "
19459,420.2,Farrah,,"yeah i like how you're thinking very much like what can we do right now with this stuff you read it as is water on the moon valuable right now but the question actually says could it be valuable at some point in the future so my suggestion would be to find some reasons why even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future ","that's a really good point okay i think we can do this "
19462,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i can share yes that astronauts can drink the water to be hydrated and you can't survive without water "
19465,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah it's like yeah i think that's why water is valuable "
19472,420.2,Jazmin,,"so you identify why water is valuable but one thing that i'm concerned about is that your answer isn't specific to just the moon and we're really thinking about why is it such a big deal that water's on the moon so my suggestion would be to keep what you have but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon ","like ok so like saying why water's important and then say like okay i think that makes sense so like looking and saying like why is it important up on the moon that it's already there Okay. Let me take a look. "
19475,420.2,Chris,,,"so i heard i read on facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff and i read on facebook that there could be a base on the moon that there was maybe one already but there was definitely going to be one by 2024 "
19482,420.2,Chris,,,"well like it's heavy to carry water and i remember there was like diet asset that show like where they were all this stuff and they were saying that water was one of the heaviest and one of the hardest things to carry into space so if they already have it in space you don't need to bring any with them "
19486,420.2,Chris,,"To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little. ","okay i'll take a look "
19492,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we we thought about this question cuz it was asking could it be valuable yeah we were trying to figure out like okay like could it be valuable as opposed to like is it valuable like right now at that was actually really interesting to look at so like basically we want to to revise our answer to say that it would be very valuable um you could use it to make rocket fuel by splitting it into it's like different chemical parts um you could use it to greek arm you could like use it for those things and and maybe you could grow a moon garden which they didn't have in the reading but i thought was an interesting idea "
19494,420.2,Oliver,,,"i would love moon flowers "
19499,420.2,Farrah,,,"so fortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for being with us and like in particular i just wanted to say like you really explained like what we needed to work on and i thought maybe that would be hard to hear but actually it was really how i class like it's nice to know like when we we weren't quite right and then we were able to be like okay because then you have this figure out what we should work and it was really helpful because then that i knew that i was going to shift and not going a different direction so thank you so much bye "
19503,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19507,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah because if the astronauts were falling to the moon to find the water they definitely needed oxygen tanks 100 i'm positive "
19513,420.1,Oliver,,"awesome i love how confident you are in your answer and i love that you're thinking about what these astronauts would need to be in space another strategy that we can use when we're answering these questions is to really focus on the keywords in our question circle the keywords in our question our action words the most important words in our texts in our question here and once you have a keyword you can raise your hand ","okay so in the question a word that i circled was equipment "
19516,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah so the word that i circled in the question is water "
19519,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and the one that i picked was discover "
19522,420.1,Luis,,,"well what oxygen tanks would do was they would have the astronaut stay alive while they were looking for the water "
19525,420.3,Farrah,,"great guess that's definitely true but i would like you student to reread paragraph two and try to circle specific words like equipment that maybe tell ius what astronauts used to discover the water okay ","okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19527,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay well a microscope and helps you see things that are really really small and in the story except the water was really really small microscopic "
19530,510.1,Oliver,,"that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords ","um yeah i think student said it and it was discover "
19532,510.1,Farrah,,,"find "
19535,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh okay well it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look but i guess what i had been thinking is how can you find it if you can't see it "
19538,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay okay yeah i'm i'm starting to get a picture of this now "
19540,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah well i just wanted to say so i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19545,510.1,Chris,,"and i think that that's an excellent strategy for class to think about when we're reading a text is to think ","at the sulfur for my answer i said that the scientists found the creator's full of water on the moon "
19549,310.1,Chris,,"awesome great and i love how you're all looking back at the text ","oh yeah okay it says this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
19551,310.1,Chris,,,"well i mean that part definitely just a little bit "
19554,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so um i just actually looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to carefully explain the different action words for the different tools i'm using that keyword really helped me in student figure out that microscope part so thank you so much "
19558,310.1,Chris,,,"thanks hi teacher how are you "
19562,310.1,Luis,,,"sure excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19564,310.1,Luis,,,"yes "
19567,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah okay so here are my answer was a scientist on craters full of water on the moon "
19572,310.1,Chris,,,"um yeah so i was looking for the words like equipment and finding or discovering water on the moon and it was in the first paragraph that i saw that they said um let's see okay this indices scientists have found evidence the water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so they talk about finding water on the moon in that sentence and scientists to "
19583,310.1,Chris,,,"Oh yeah I guess I forgot about that part. Okay yeah sure. "
19585,310.1,Jazmin,,,"excuse me teacher "
19588,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i got my answer from the second paragraph so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19593,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said nasa sent a small machine okay that's right out of the second paragraph which you told student to look "
19600,430.2,Jazmin,,"the in the question the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so can you tell me like what exactly equipment the scientists to use i saw you just say a small machine can you tell me the name of the machine ","i don't remember the name of it um lunar orbiter okay it's a lunar orbiter "
19603,520.1,Jazmin,,"next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay ","oh okay "
19607,520.1,Chris,,,"oh no teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks and masks and soups "
19615,520.1,Chris,,,"okay so in the second paragraph i saw that on them the equipment that student just said the lunar orbiter "
19617,520.1,Chris,,,"okay so that's the answer "
19622,520.1,Chris,,,"guess i just didn't know how to how to change my answer should i just say i'm scientists use the lunar orbiter and found craters full of water on the moon "
19625,520.1,Chris,,,"oh "
19629,520.1,Chris,,,"the lunar orbiter will learn at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater so "
19634,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah cuz i'm this one the one i just read says they'll look for ice deposit in a large polar crater in my sentence says they found craters full of water so i mean it's it's it the both of them talk about the crater but i guess in the this sentence it says ice and not water i guess that's the difference "
19640,520.1,Chris,,,"Okay, better better like about the question or just any keyword to the answer. "
19643,520.1,Oliver,,,"um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
19645,520.1,Oliver,,,"you're welcome bye "
19652,520.1,Luis,,,"i think so let me look back at those sentence again um teacher okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
19654,520.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen "
19658,520.1,Luis,,,"okay i might not have read the whole thing let me see okay okay so i didn't find it in the story cuz i already know about space so i just pulled that one out of my brain "
19663,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so it's asking me to say what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. "
19666,520.1,Luis,,,"to find water "
19672,520.1,Jazmin,,,"oh and okay so so no it doesn't address that question because you know accident tanks are used to breathe but i guess they're not used to find water Okay teacher i'm still kind of confused "
19674,520.1,Jazmin,,,"yes okay so you asked me what the name of it was in so i see that the name of the machine is the lunar orbiter and but then i guess i don't know like do i just have to add that to my answer i guess i don't know what when i'm supposed to write for my answer "
19679,520.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay yeah it's the same thing, even said, you know it wants us to tell what the equipment is that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. so yes i i had that the small machine but then i was going to just add called a lunar orbiter but i guess i don't know if that's if that's enough of the answer or not "
19683,520.1,Jazmin,,,"yes "
19685,520.1,Jazmin,,,"so i god is the difference is just adding the name "
19693,430.2,Jazmin,,"in this way that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so ","Okay. "
19696,430.2,Chris,,,"iphone on the keywords on the keywords that you asked i think we're equipment discover water on the moon you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
19699,430.2,Chris,,,"on the internet or cuz i would like to read about what's going on at nasa and so there was an article on the internet talking about some of the work that are that the scientists are doing to try to find life and on the moon and so they may be in three years they could put a base up there me "
19709,430.2,Chris,,,"I think it was the one that says. all the second sentence maybe in paragraph two "
19711,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool a crater "
19716,430.2,Chris,,,"oh no it was in the first paragraph "
19721,510.1,Oliver,,"when you're trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph ","yeah i understand um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for when you explain to student and student the strategy of trying to look at the keywords and the question and then finding the keyword in that story also to underline that gives me ideas on what i need to work on to "
19723,510.1,Oliver,,,"you're welcome "
19726,510.1,Farrah,,,"bye hi "
19733,510.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
19735,510.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah that sounds great "
19740,510.1,Oliver,,,"yes can i go "
19743,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i think that they used on won't student and i we kind of have the same answer and we both thought that the scientists used a microscope because the story said the water was really small like so small you couldn't even see it and so you'd need a microscope so like you could see the water "
19751,410.1,Jazmin,,"however i think that this point doesn't answer directly the main question this is the next step after they discovered water for the moon hey this is part of the equipment that they discovered what are the one ","well i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19756,410.1,Jazmin,,,"and let me look into nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter "
19761,410.1,Jazmin,,,"oh so i just had to say the name "
19769,410.1,Farrah,,,"hi i'm student well i said the microscope too like student said and i still a little confused about how come how come it's the lunar orbiter and not a microscope can you explain that again "
19774,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh so they had to they had to send the lunar orbiter first to find it and then they had to use the microscope to see it "
19777,410.1,Chris,,,"so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like science some like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19781,410.1,Chris,,,"well if there were astronauts they'd need them but maybe if it was a ship with no astronauts than they wouldn't need that so were there astronauts or no "
19783,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah that's really causing me see wow so it was just a robot and it was able to go around the moon and and find the water for them "
19787,410.1,Oliver,,,"well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text on such a such a deep level like i understand now why they use a microscope later and i weren't even astronauts there and you just really helped us read it written really detailed so we could understand it so thank you so much "
19792,410.1,Farrah,,,"nice to meet you "
19795,410.1,Luis,,,"we read it already and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19798,410.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah sounds good to me "
19802,410.1,Chris,,,"well so i think the main idea of the story is that that there's actually water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know that there is water on the moon "
19806,420.3,Oliver,,"but you know something that we can do is just like to pay attention to the titles and subtitles these titles and subtitles can give you more information about the main ideas of the text ","i offer one "
19808,420.3,Oliver,,,"so you said the subtitle and the subtitle is a moon is a desert so i think the point as actually that even though they found water on the moon there's not that much of it it's really small oh also it's ice and not water "
19811,420.3,Oliver,,,"i don't know "
19814,420.3,Farrah,,,"are you talking about the part that says water is a valuable resource "
19816,420.3,Farrah,,,"well actually i'm still a little confused about the first part "
19820,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah so i thought the main word was equipment and so my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why that answer is wrong "
19825,420.1,Jazmin,,"So the, you know, another keyword that is under question that they can help us to answer this question? ","student i know you said equipment and i think that's important but actually i think the more important word is actually discover "
19830,420.1,Farrah,,,"it's to look really closely at really small things "
19833,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah you're right "
19836,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19838,420.1,Chris,,,"from the story "
19841,420.1,Chris,,,"i well i guess those aren't from the story but i just thought because we were talking about equipment that that's equipment that scientists sometimes use "
19846,420.1,Farrah,,,"so it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about where we found our answers and then whether or not being worked with that word discover that was really helpful "
19849,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi miss teacher it's good to see you "
19855,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah i do i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19857,420.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah "
19862,420.1,Oliver,,"what are the main words of this question in order to have an answer we have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for ","okay so i said a main word in the question was equipment because you know that the answer has to be like a thing a tool "
19865,420.1,Oliver,,,"what do i think is the right answer "
19867,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay well so my answer was that the equipment up and used what's the microscope "
19871,420.1,Chris,,,"Okay. So I said, the main point was water. "
19876,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and so a verb is an action word and the action word in the question is discover and that's what i thought was the main word "
19881,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19884,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah i know that's one it's the lunar orbiter student come on "
19889,420.1,Chris,,,"next step like so after they after they find the water in the craters well so on after the part about the lunar orbiter it talks about how there's not very much of it so maybe they measured it because it says there's 32 ounces so maybe after they found it they measured it "
19892,420.1,Farrah,,,"um well i think that was my answer the microscope "
19895,420.1,Farrah,,,"well i thought who was the answer to the question about about what they use to discover the water i guess i'm not quite sure why why the microscope isn't just the whole answer "
19897,420.1,Farrah,,,"so i guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both "
19901,420.1,Oliver,,,"so i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about the main words in the question because that helps us find the very best answer in the text "
19903,420.1,Farrah,,,"hi hi how are you "
19906,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh good oh good it's nice to meet you so so we just finished reading the water on the moon "
19908,420.1,Luis,,,"excuse me excuse me this is student um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space "
19917,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay so should we just talk to each other or what do you want us to do "
19920,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay thank you yeah "
19923,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah i thought that was so cool "
19925,420.1,Chris,,,"okay oh part three you said the first sentence okay it says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on earth "
19927,420.1,Chris,,,"all like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see and the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff "
19931,420.1,Chris,,,"well there's definitely water but hackers maybe the craters are full of water like i was kind of picturing that in my head that they were full of water like little pools but i guess if it's like a desert it must be a lot smaller and harder to see "
19933,420.1,Chris,,,"okay i'll read it "
19935,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i said that necessity a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19939,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater "
19941,420.1,Jazmin,,,"don't really know because i know that it looks for them but i don't really know what it does next i don't think it's "
19943,420.1,Jazmin,,,"maybe they're studying it "
19945,420.1,Jazmin,,,"so that's not answer right just the small machine "
19947,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh oh okay so just add some more to my answer "
19950,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah well i was thinking about equipment and actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19954,510.1,Chris,,"when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text ","oh you mean the story "
19956,510.1,Chris,,,"no it doesn't say oxygen tanks in the story "
19959,520.1,Chris,,"so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already ","so i need to pick up pick up a piece of equipment from the story "
19961,520.1,Chris,,,"okay that makes sense yeah "
19963,520.1,Oliver,,,"on actually i just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful so thank you so much "
19965,520.1,,,,"hello class thank you for sharing your responses to "
19969,520.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me excuse me i have my hand up "
19972,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so you asked us where where we found the microscope "
19974,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so it's in part three and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19979,310.1,Farrah,,"i was wondering if we could look a little bit deeper into the first excuse me the second paragraph and find out if there's a more specific tool that you can use as evidence for this answer okay that's great evidence to support it ","yeah okay we can look at it "
19981,310.1,Luis,,,"yes please um so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19987,420.1,Farrah,,"you all brought your background knowledge to answer this question and i'm happy that you are able to do that i want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is and circle that okay ","okay okay we looked at part two again "
19989,420.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess in part two it talks about a machine but i don't really understand why my answer is wrong "
19998,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh well i mean i guess i kind of thought it was the microscope because if the water so small how can you discover it until you can actually see Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here. I kind of agree because like if you need to discover it i i guess that's why i picked a microscope because it seems like that's the tool you'd need to see it yeah "
20002,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh i i don't see the word sample on in the story but it talks about the ice deposits "
20004,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits "
20006,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i guess yeah that sounds like they use the lunar orbiter to help find the water but i don't know if i would have picked it the first time "
20013,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so i said the word equipment was the most important part and on well i actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20015,430.3,Chris,,"So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon? ","oh so like equipment that's in the story "
20017,430.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah i'll look at "
20019,430.3,Jazmin,,,"i picked discover "
20022,430.3,Jazmin,,,"because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does so that sounded that sounded important because it's like the action "
20026,430.3,Oliver,,,"come i'm so sorry but um it's it's actually time for us to go now but before before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers thank you "
20033,420.1,Luis,,"class take a second and think about what the most important part of that question is take a second to reread the question and circle the most important part ","i still have to say i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
20035,420.1,Luis,,,"i thought so that's why i had to say it "
20037,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so i think the most important part of the question is evidence "
20040,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay well um i thought that the most important part of the question was the word convincing because it seems like when you're thinking about the question you need to be convinced whether the water on the moon is going to be good "
20044,420.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i think i got it from the last part of the of the story part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money so it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today "
20049,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah yeah i'll kind of the same like student sad um i think it was the part yeah at the end because it sounds like it's going to be really expensive and there there wasn't that much water from like the first part of the story so it just seems like a waste of money and it's just not ready "
20052,420.1,Oliver,,,"Yeah, we'll do that. "
20055,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i have an idea "
20057,420.1,Jazmin,,,"well i think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
20060,430.3,Jazmin,,"i'm concerned that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water so i want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence you could find to support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water okay ","yeah i'm sorry you want me to read it again "
20062,420.3,Jazmin,,"yeah read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time ","okay "
20064,420.3,Chris,,,"water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
20069,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i got one i got one "
20072,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah so i know you could drink it well it doesn't sound like there's a lot of drinking but it also said like what the hydrogen and oxygen you could use it to make a rocket fuel "
20075,420.3,Luis,,,"no i didn't really think of that "
20079,420.3,Luis,,,"you know i think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful but i think i might have to learn a little more about cars if that was more water it might be useful but if it's only one is it felt like a murmur four cups that doesn't sound very useful "
20083,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah so um we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us to think about our answer in a new way like if we said it wasn't valuable you asked us to think maybe it could be and if we said it was valuable you asked us to think maybe wouldn't be so we all have to think about the question from both both sides and that was really cool "
20086,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi it's nice to meet you "
20089,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i don't i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20095,420.3,Chris,,,"here this is student i thought it was really cool that scientists they found craters full of water on the moon i never knew that before "
20100,420.3,Oliver,,,"thank you well i just thought it was really interesting that the moon was a desert because i never really thought about like what the moon was made off on like what what it felt like and looked like and stuff "
20106,420.3,Farrah,,,"i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20110,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well nasa sent a small machine didn't understand why my answer is wrong "
20121,310.1,Luis,,"but that's a good answer because it does refers to something back in the text so i like that answer ","yeah i got this it's called a lunar orbiter it's called lunar orbiter "
20126,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i guess story it says they use it to investigate but but i circled the same as student about the microscope because you need that because the water is so small like can you find that if you can't even see it "
20132,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i can because yeah go ahead go ahead american yeah that's my answer they found the water in the craters and they found the craters full of water "
20137,310.1,Chris,,,"Go ahead. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. "
20146,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i can try so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then they had to use a microscope and the astronauts also use all the stuff that student talked about too "
20156,310.1,Oliver,,,"well yeah i was just gonna say it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to see thank you because it was really cool to think about how the moon would feel and i really like that you talked about that and you'll also help us understand how each of our answers connected to the question and it was just really fun to talk to you today "
20159,310.1,Farrah,,,"it's good to see you "
20162,310.1,Farrah,,,"it's been pretty good yeah "
20167,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so we were reading water on the moon and i just want to remind you i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20173,310.1,Luis,,,"of course anytime thank you "
20176,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon "
20182,310.1,Farrah,,,"um i said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20187,310.1,Farrah,,,"so it's in it's in paragraph three and they talked about a tool called a microscope and they talked about how the ice was really small and so you can all see it if you didn't have a microscope "
20190,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah because it's a tool "
20194,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20198,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well okay so in part one they talk about water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater "
20204,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i said that yes i sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong "
20207,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well they talked about it in part two that's where i found my answer and i guess i know i was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine seemed like a piece of equipment and and they described describe how it looks for ice "
20210,510.1,Chris,,"so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you class next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process ","oh yeah so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
20213,510.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah no that's it i just saw all this stuff at nasa and so since we're talking about equipment i was thinking that they probably used all that stuff "
20221,510.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me "
20225,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i just i wanted to say actually um it's time it's time for the next class we have to go but um i wanted to say thank you so much because you really helped us feel that our answers and the stuff that we already know what's really valuable and important and you also helped us look in the text and understand where our answers came from "
20230,420.1,Luis,,"identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text you can use that word to help you answer the question ","okay yeah i know people are still working but i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut "
20235,420.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i have an answer equipment "
20237,420.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i had also picked equipment actually so "
20242,420.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah i guess yeah the equipment seems important "
20244,420.1,Chris,,,"well actually i thought that it was water what equipment to find water on the moon "
20246,420.1,Jazmin,,,"discover "
20254,420.3,Jazmin,,"take two minutes and read and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but i want a sentence for out of class for a revised answer ","can i ask something "
20256,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i know you want us to reread again but i don't know how to fix my answer cuz i don't i don't know why it's wrong because i picked the equipment to discover so what do i do "
20263,420.2,Jazmin,,"so for you i would say read that part and see if you can add another detail on to it maybe think about the equipment's looking for water maybe where's the water or maybe something to that effect we can really make a more detailed answer ","i guess i can try to add more detail for my answer so when i looked at again i found a few details about the machine and it said the center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i guess i would say on that the equipment they use to sign the water was a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
20267,310.1,Oliver,,"great answer student i love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive great answer student i love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive and you use that to make a complete answer i love your answer he told us what equipment they use and what it was called exactly and what it did was it three great things thank you for that that was awesome ","i yep okay um so using those three words we picked i would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope "
20270,310.1,Oliver,,,"paragraph three remember yeah it's in paragraph three and it says that says on waters microscopic and you need a microscope to see it's so the equipment used to discover water was a microscope oh "
20278,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay um can i try again can i do another answer "
20280,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay so i would say if i was putting it all together i would say the equipment to discover the water was first a lunar orbiter and then a microscope "
20289,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah it sounds like you're wrapping up and we have to go to lunch to um but you can finish what you were saying "
20292,310.1,Oliver,,,"thank you for helping us make the best to answer so we could make with all of the details that we need "
20295,310.1,Farrah,,,"good morning "
20297,310.1,Farrah,,,"first period first period i know i know "
20302,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
20307,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i never thought there would be water on the moon i thought it was just i don't know dry up there "
20310,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh well i don't think i never really thought about that before like maybe there is water on the moon maybe around the moon i wasn't really i never really thought about it i guess "
20313,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i would say i would say i was surprised "
20315,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i actually went to nasa and well i didn't know there was water on the moon but i thought it was really cool "
20318,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah there was stuff in there "
20322,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20325,310.1,Jazmin,,,"since we're all in this small class and doesn't that mean our answers are quite right "
20329,310.1,Jazmin,,,"like in an english class "
20333,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes we do "
20340,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah i do "
20344,310.1,Farrah,,,"yes yes it's here on the top of the paper "
20353,420.1,Chris,,"let's use a tool that helps us focus ourselves to make sure we're finding the information in our reading take a minute take your pencil and circle what you think is the most important word in the question that's going to help us know what to look for so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled ","oh it's just gonna say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20355,420.1,Chris,,,"um equipment "
20358,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i circled discover "
20365,420.2,Oliver,,"I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper. So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text. So, Oliver. What's up, ","i'm so sorry this class is so fun but we have to go to lunch now and i just wanted to say thank you so much you were so nice and you really helped us understand the question and what the question was asking us when you helped us find those keywords and i know that's going to be really helpful in other classes just like you said not just language like not just english i'm not just science but like all of our classes so thank you so much for joining us today "
20373,420.3,Luis,,"i see that you understand a little about what a microscope is and but i'm a little concerned i see that you understand a little about what a microscope is but i'm a little concerned that while the microscope is a tool it didn't really discover the water on the moon so i suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again can you do that for me ","i don't understand why i shouldn't i don't feel like i should be on this class you know i already know a lot about space "
20376,410.1,Luis,,"so i like that you found some details in the article but i'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text so looking back at the question what's the question that we're looking for can you tell me that are you able to tell me what the question is ","yeah it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
20379,410.1,Luis,,,"a new answer "
20385,420.3,Jazmin,,"Another the main equipment. Okay. Chris. Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used ","i don't understand my my answers wrong "
20389,420.2,Jazmin,,"So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle. Something else that links with that to help further your answer. Can you do that for me. ","okay my answer and then circle start "
20392,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i want you to underline what you did answer which was nasa sent a small machine so underlined small machine okay and then i want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer a little bit more ","okay "
20396,420.2,Farrah,,,"we looked at it all in well i mean i still feel like my answer was right "
20398,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah me too "
20400,420.2,Farrah,,,"um well i mean when i was looking at it i did see they they talked about the machine and in paragraph two "
20402,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater these two positives very small "
20406,420.2,Farrah,,,"i mean i'm like it could be but but the question asks about water and i'm in my part it also talks about them looking for water with a microscope so and i don't see anything about water in this "
20409,420.3,Chris,,"but i think i want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar orbiter okay so read a little bit more and maybe take some time to underline some keywords in your texts ","i went to nasa which i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks suits "
20412,420.3,Chris,,,"okay um yeah so i guess we have to go to lunch anyway but yeah thanks for coming to visit us and on visit our class and kind of ask us some questions about what would read about in the text "
20416,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20423,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so um the name for the equipment that i found is microscope "
20427,420.3,Farrah,,,"um well okay you said part two on it says a small machine called a lunar orbiter i don't know what that is "
20430,420.3,Chris,,,"on yeah i can do that okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
20434,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so they're both the right answer yep "
20438,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i'm wondering that was my answer that nasa such a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20440,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh okay so if i just put nasa sent a small machine then i'm right "
20444,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh ok so it's kind of like they a tool like work together "
20446,420.3,Chris,,,"well so well my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20449,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20452,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i mean so my answer was kind of like what student just pass i said scientists he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
20455,420.3,Oliver,,,"on your so well i said the same thing i said about the microscope and i guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on both the orbiter and the microscope because i mean the question asked her about what equipment they use to discover the water and i still think of some microscope because how can you discover something if you can't even see it "
20460,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah so that's kind of like they use first they use the lunar orbiter and then i use a microscope "
20462,420.3,Oliver,,,"thanks "
20465,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i thought it was a really interesting because i didn't actually know that there was water on the moon before i read this and i thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter and it was like this robot that found the water for them i really want to help make something like that one day cool "
20467,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um that was a really helpful way to put it thank you so much "
20474,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20479,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah in the in the second paragraph it talks about how nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and so a machine is equipment too "
20484,420.3,Chris,,,"let me see it investigated the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater okay it investigated and it looked for ice deposits "
20487,420.3,Jazmin,,,"for this one i mean i know what we use it for in science class "
20489,420.3,Jazmin,,,"let's see for this one these it to look really closely at the water "
20494,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay um so what you said is that um student was right and student what student read and student read was right too because there are two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and a microscope "
20497,420.3,Farrah,,,"i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20503,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah that makes sense "
20507,420.3,Luis,,,"well i mean ok so now i know that there's like a microscope in space and a lunar orbiter and space um yeah i mean i guess that's it "
20512,420.3,Luis,,,"well mean i think any place that there's water would be good because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff yeah "
20514,420.3,Chris,,,"you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20519,420.3,Chris,,,"wait um so teacher i didn't i didn't write the microscope or the lunar orbiter in mine so i guess i don't know what's wrong with my answer or how to fix my answer "
20532,410.3,Chris,,"you know there's actually very little water really on the moon ","um i guess you're seeing that the it wasn't a lot of water but i guess well i got mine from a paragraph and it saysum they found water water that can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and if i go swimming and in the deep in the deep end of the pool that's not a lot more water "
20537,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i guess "
20539,410.3,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later "
20542,410.3,Oliver,,,"hello "
20544,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20546,410.3,Luis,,,"that sounds okay "
20549,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah that's my answer "
20551,410.3,Luis,,,"question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
20555,410.3,Luis,,,"um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100 "
20560,420.3,Luis,,"and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can. ","um okay um So what should I do next. "
20563,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah i'll do that "
20565,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yes "
20570,420.2,Jazmin,,"i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific so what were they sending the small machines for ","to watch a final water i don't understand why my answer is wrong out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two. "
20572,420.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
20575,420.2,Jazmin,,"well i think your answers right there right so you said nasa send a small machine i would include the rest of that sentence in your answer so what was that small machine called ","lunar orbiter "
20579,420.2,Jazmin,,"awesome yeah i think that's really important information to include because that's the machine that they use to discover the water ","yeah yes that sounds right so i just add the name and then my answer is done "
20582,420.2,Jazmin,,,"great yeah "
20584,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said "
20587,310.1,Chris,,"awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me ","yeah it's so cool "
20591,310.1,Chris,,,"oh what a scientist use to discover well well so i'm actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20595,420.2,Chris,,"so i'm wondering if you can make your answer a little bit more specific so we're looking for the equipment that they use to discover water on the moon ","well i mean the thing student was talking about sounded pretty good "
20598,420.2,Chris,,,"okay yeah i'm "
20600,420.2,Chris,,,"um well i guess so "
20603,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah that would be good "
20606,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope "
20611,410.2,Oliver,,"i'm wondering if you class wouldn't mind going back and rereading the text and seeing if we can find a more specific answer what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon you class found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skipped the discover step somewhere in there ","well how come you discover something after you can't see it "
20616,310.1,Oliver,,"i'm wondering if there might be some equipment that we missed in that text that told us how they were able to discover it so i had the same question when i was reading it right i was thinking how did they find it they can't even see it ","okay yeah sure "
20619,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say um it really matters a lot but you listen to every one of our answers and gave each one of us advice about how to make it more specific i really felt like you really listen to each of us so thank you so much "
20621,310.1,Luis,,,"me "
20623,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
20626,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just have this this quick kind of question and mostly it's just because um well okay so i kind of already know everything there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to be in this class "
20629,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah we read that "
20633,310.1,Farrah,,,"so my my answer was that i thought that they use they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i believe that they use the microscope to find the water "
20635,310.1,Farrah,,,"well they were using it to see because the water were these i think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye so they had to see it in the microscope because it was so small "
20639,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um so i guess i was just confused because actually i feel like i answered this question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong or like not correct because i i think i had an answer to this question but i guess i'm not sure "
20641,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
20643,310.1,Jazmin,,,"it was the lunar orbiter "
20645,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i thought the lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when i read that that that text really closely it looks like they use the lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water "
20648,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah that's yeah that's what i said "
20651,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it through a microscope but they also said that there wasn't very much like they were talking about how they were taking the glass and measuring the water and there was only like very little water in the like i think it was like a ton of dirt or something "
20655,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess i guess i was just wondering like i know cuz i went to nasa with my dad that astronauts use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits kind of like what student was saying and i guess i'm confused because i added that to my paper because it seemed like they were missing that in the reading it didn't mention it and it seems like that would be really important "
20660,310.1,Chris,,,"well the fact that they were on the moon and the fact that basically like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe so i was like well if they're going around with the microscope and the lunar orbiter and all this stuff like they better have oxygen tanks because otherwise they can't hold the microscope up to the to the ice you know "
20665,310.1,Oliver,,,"um so unfortunately i know it was a really short time but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and again i know it's a really short time but i really wanted to thank you for working with us because i think that we all really appreciate the way that you asked us to really look back at the text and to clarify our answers and you were really you like really valued what we had to say so i think right class like i think class felt like um like you are really listening to us so thank you so much because that was really cool was really fun thank you "
20668,310.1,All,,,"hi "
20670,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah so i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer i changed my answer to scientists found ice using a small machine "
20679,520.1,Farrah,,"or even thinking beyond today what are some tools that we can use for future texts like these ","oh yeah absolutely so what i said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
20684,520.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so i was thinking that basically like okay so it says what equipment did the scientists right and i was like okay so i'm gonna find equipment and i found that my personal and i thought this is definitely the right equipment because how could they find the water which they said was tiny microscopic and then like how could they find the water if they couldn't see it so that was kind of my thinking "
20690,520.1,Farrah,,,"i just wanted to say that it was great the first time but i also added some details of the meeting i said that scientists used me she called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon okay thank you for that student i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so i student really quick i just wanted to go back to student for a little bit just to ask um student what was your revised answer so what i said when i revised it was that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon i ended up with the same answer "
20695,520.1,Jazmin,,,"it was actually okay so i knew in the first and today i said that the scientists sentence small machine but i realized that i looked up the name of the machine and then i realized after listening to them and student talk about how small the water was that like microscopic i thought that the best answer would include like what they were like so like they said the lunar orbiter and like what they sent it to you so that seemed like that was the right answer "
20697,530.1,Jazmin,,"okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers ","well i think the main thing that i i added with detail like first i added the detail of the of the object so i didn't just say like kind of what it was i said like specifically what was it that makes sense "
20700,530.1,Jazmin,,,"also like basically i i added detail about like what they were discovering because i just said the sense that the small machine but but there's more to the answer because it's saying like what you know what equipment did they said to discover and i thought like well it's an even better answer says what he said "
20704,520.1,Chris,,"yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important ","well i was just i actually had a question i just heard what student and student said and it made me think i had a question so the water that the scientists found was it was microscopic like it wasn't like a lot of water it was just tiny water "
20710,520.1,Oliver,,,"i remember because i was i was what i was seeing that it said that there were only 32 ounces of water in a ton of the top layer like the dirt on the moon and so they said that was just four glasses of water like in a ton of dirt which is a lot of dirt "
20716,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh i would love to answer but we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this this was really fun thank you bye "
20721,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i got this all figured out so i think i'm good to go "
20723,520.1,Luis,,,"yeah so okay so my initial answer when i didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that but then after we work together and i actually looked at the reading and all this stuff i said okay scientists found ice using a small machine "
20726,520.1,Luis,,,"yeah they found ice using a small machine "
20736,420.2,Luis,,"Okay, so we have that ice detail there, which is good that we are adding details student i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed ","what was the machine well the machine was on the you know the the rocket ship the thing you call it "
20738,420.2,Luis,,,"i got it okay it's the lunar orbit "
20740,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter "
20743,530.1,Luis,,"yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have ","well okay so you said that i needed to use details in the answer and so when i went and looked back in the in the reading i saw that the small machine was actually called the lunar orbiter like it wasn't a rocket ship but i mean it is a rocket ship but it's also like that's the actual name for it so that's what that seemed like the answer to be "
20752,420.2,Luis,,"when we have a question that tells us to use the text ","yeah so like i should make sure that i i guess like look closely at the reading is that is that is that right "
20756,420.3,Luis,,"so maybe not literally looking very close at the reading but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to answer the question ","yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so okay i think i understand "
20762,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah sure so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use. but then i realized after we had class together that actually the lunar orbiter was but discovered the water so i realized that i had to read the question really close and because i was focused on the finding the equipment not on what the equipment was doing because the question wasn't like how did scientists study the water it was how did they discover the water that so that was really different and once i realized that i realized i have to look really closely at the question like what it was asking "
20764,310.1,Oliver,,"that's great student and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about how you were answering that question and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic and student you have your hand raised before ","well i was just gonna say that i think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool "
20770,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah absolutely so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you and i in particular i really wanted to thank you for working with us like you really helped us to understand like what we needed to think about in terms of our strategy so we were able to like think about how we found our answers and i never thought about that but it was really useful so i honestly right class like i found it really useful to like have the time to really think about like okay so how did i even come up with my answer because i come up with some pretty good answer but i never thought about like how did i come up with that so thank you so much "
20772,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh nice to meet you teacher oh we're doing great we're really excited for your class "
20774,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well i just i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20778,310.1,Luis,,,"okay okay "
20781,310.1,Luis,,,"definitely want to go to the moon i want to be an astronaut so bad "
20784,310.1,Luis,,,"oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there i can't wait i really want to go to space camp because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut and i want to discover new planets and galaxies too "
20786,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i can share "
20788,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i'm really just more passionate about the earth and saving the earth and and i really think we should focus on this planet the one that we have in the one that we're living on and saving it while we live here "
20790,310.1,Jazmin,,,"student "
20794,310.1,Jazmin,,,"see i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20799,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes okay well i found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
20804,310.1,Farrah,,,"it's something we can like lune "
20807,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah up i got this one i bought this one we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun because we go around it "
20811,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i don't know i guess that's my question because i thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles "
20813,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i just wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20822,310.1,Farrah,,,"that microscopes not on the moon "
20827,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say when you just told us about how the lunar orbiter works that was that was so interesting and i wish the story told us that because i think i think i would have been a lot more excited if i knew about the throwing of the stuff in the and the smoke bloom and all of that stuff so thank you for teaching us that "
20830,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi hello "
20832,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're excited to work with you "
20835,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20843,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay "
20848,310.1,Oliver,,,"um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon "
20851,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20854,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so in part three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it "
20863,430.2,Jazmin,,"let's look back at paragraph two to re review and see and you know specifically how scientists got to the moon to have that top soil to to analyze and ","well if you only read it once like you might not remember everything by the time you get to the end you might forget the beginning "
20868,510.1,Chris,,"so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex and reviewing them a couple times is important ","yeah well i didn't go to space but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20871,510.1,Chris,,,"oh no no i didn't know that part till i read the story "
20873,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah i said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20879,410.3,Oliver,,"but my concern though is is that maybe the way the form that the water is in on the moon is a little different than the way that we see perhaps a lake full of water here on earth ","um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice "
20883,410.3,Oliver,,,"oh yeah um before we keep going um i want to let you know actually it's time for us to go "
20886,410.3,Farrah,,,"good thanks for asking "
20889,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20896,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah okay yeah "
20902,410.3,Jazmin,,,"and it's it's asking us to find an equipment "
20907,420.3,Farrah,,"you're exactly right exactly right so when we are going back through the texts and we are looking for equipment specifically i would like for class to write down in their learning journals equipment okay let's just write down that word real quickly ","okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20909,420.3,Farrah,,,"well okay they said the waters microscopic on so how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope "
20914,430.1,Farrah,,"we were looking for the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place so can you look back at the text to identify this machine and then answer what that piece of equipment was ","i don't know yet "
20921,430.1,Chris,,,"okay i've said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20927,430.1,Chris,,,"Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon. "
20932,430.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay student so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them "
20937,430.1,Chris,,,"yeah we'll talk about that like the microscope and stuff um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20940,430.1,Chris,,,"well yeah for people to breathe for the astronauts to breathe "
20944,430.1,Oliver,,,"on i really wish we could keep going but it's time for us to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us to read the text on more than once so that we can understand all the details i think that's going to be really helpful next time "
20947,430.1,Farrah,,,"hello oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
20953,430.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me yeah yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20955,430.1,Luis,,,"okay that sounds good "
20961,430.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20964,430.1,Chris,,,"okay so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20967,430.1,Jazmin,,,"i said that nasa send a small machine "
20970,430.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i circled the same thing as some fan oh okay "
20973,430.1,Luis,,,"okay um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
20987,410.3,Jazmin,,"i don't think the text said they found a big amount of just water but they found various little small things that you cannot even see with the human eye ","yes so well what about my answer nasa to small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong cuz i thought if we were in this class our answer was wrong so "
20993,410.3,Jazmin,,,"so how did they use that machine though because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate "
20999,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah so since we're talking about equipment um i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks like student said but also on masks and suits "
21004,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah i i bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right "
21008,410.3,Chris,,,"right yeah because you said well that the craters you said they're not full of water like i thought right because the water is so small "
21011,410.3,Oliver,,,"um i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text even better today it was really nice to meet you and work with you "
21014,410.3,Chris,,,"hi hi teacher "
21017,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay um excuse me teacher yes i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21019,410.3,Luis,,,"ya "
21021,410.3,Luis,,,"yes they did "
21025,410.3,Luis,,,"okay i don't know that no i didn't really read it cuz i figured i already knew everything so "
21029,410.3,Luis,,,"okay okay "
21034,410.3,Chris,,,"um i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
21037,410.3,Chris,,,"they didn't "
21041,410.3,Farrah,,,"my in my section is said it was microscopic um so that means that it was really really small amount of water "
21043,410.3,Chris,,,"okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when i go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool "
21046,410.3,Chris,,,"okay. "
21049,410.3,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21052,410.3,Oliver,,,"i said nasa sent a small machine i think your answer is wrong because me and student have the right answer the microscope is the right answer "
21062,410.3,Chris,,,"i think the microscope is the right answer but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer student well i think that we're right and you're wrong well i don't know that's why i asked the teacher oh well it's i got it right out of the story well i mean you didn't actually say the name of the machine student i said the microscope is the name i think that jazmin's one is right because um in in the part where it talks about the microscope it says that they're looking at the water in in in jazmin's section it says that they're investigating and i think investigating is closer to um what's the word in the question oh discover i think investigate this closer to discover than looking at something also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21064,410.3,Chris,,,"well they need them to breathe on the moon "
21069,410.3,Chris,,,"oh i don't know i just thought the astronauts went to the moon but i guess in the story well it says scientists scientists have found evidence "
21072,410.3,Chris,,,"oh i didn't think about that "
21077,410.3,Oliver,,,"um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for what you said to student at helping me think about looking more closely at the story to try to understand more of the details of the story "
21079,410.3,Oliver,,,"hi hello how are you doing "
21081,410.3,Oliver,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you "
21085,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah yeah but i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21088,410.3,Luis,,,"um well i sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
21091,410.3,Luis,,,"um i mean there's probably some other staff what i know that if there are astronauts on the moon they definitely have oxygen tanks "
21097,410.3,Farrah,,,"well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because in the story and said that the water they found was microscopic "
21100,410.3,Farrah,,,"well i don't know because i thought it was the microscope because how can you find something if it's too small to see "
21103,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i found my answer and the second paragraph and i said that nasa to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is from "
21108,420.3,Oliver,,"could you class look at your text and see if you can find any more specific information in that second paragraph ","okay second paragraph right we're student was talking about at sas nasa simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
21113,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so you're saying they had to use this orbiter to find the water before they could see it "
21116,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh okay well that's really cool but how how could i have figured that out on my own like without jazmin's help "
21123,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well i i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like even said but also on masks and suits "
21128,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so there's no astronauts hmm um yeah i just looked at that story student and it doesn't even say anything about astronauts actually "
21137,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us think about the words in the story that we're like the word discover because i really thought it was a microscope but when you put it that way it really made a lot more sense why it was the lunar orbiter so thank you so much "
21142,420.3,Luis,,,"um excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21145,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay "
21148,420.3,Luis,,,"okay um that there's no gravity in space you know so like if you go there you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero "
21150,420.3,Luis,,,"um not really about the moon no "
21153,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah i know that they're doing a lot of work to try to see if the moon could be inhabitable or if they can study some of the geology on the moon to see how we can use it to help us here on earth "
21155,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah geology is like the study of rocks "
21162,420.3,Farrah,,,"um i found mine in paragraph one i found mine in paragraph two um me too mine was in paragraph three "
21165,420.3,Luis,,,"um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that. "
21170,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah um so i think that's why i picked the answer from paragraph two so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
21172,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
21176,420.2,Jazmin,,"can we think of what the specific name of that small machine is i want us to get as specific as possible when we're thinking about this specific equipment ","yeah it's called the lunar orbiter "
21180,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i know they were using it to look at it because that's exactly what it says in the answer um oh if they were using it to find it on i don't know "
21183,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay well in paragraph three they do use the word found it says all water they found was microscopic "
21185,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh okay okay "
21188,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um i guess i'd use jazmin's idea uh the lunar orbiter "
21190,420.2,Chris,,,"um you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21192,420.2,Chris,,,"okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
21194,420.2,Chris,,,"it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
21197,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah oh cuz ice yeah sorry teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay "
21199,420.2,Chris,,,"bye teacher "
21201,420.2,Chris,,,"hi teacher i'm good "
21204,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
21207,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah so i said water can be split up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
21210,310.1,Oliver,,"Yes, so Luis I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of ","um valuable is like when something costs a lot of money "
21214,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay cuz you know like accident we gotta breathe man we need oxygen to breathe so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die "
21216,310.1,Luis,,,"hydrogen i don't know i mean i don't know we learned that it's a gas but i don't know what we use it for "
21224,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so um in the fifth paragraph it says that like rocket fuel helps spacecrafts to move and the moon can serve as a stop for spacecrafts but i don't i'm still confused "
21229,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i heard this one and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel "
21232,310.1,Chris,,,"okay well it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy i mean i already had that part in my answer "
21235,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i didn't have either of those so i guess i could see how they could drink the water and that'd be important maybe they'd have like a water fountain up there or something "
21243,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay um i started out thinking well in the future it will be valuable as well it's in the right now it won't be valuable because it's not ready yet um but now i'm thinking that maybe if they can get on of water then they could like have something to drink and they could like make fuel up there too "
21245,310.1,Chris,,,"no so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher i was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
21251,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah man i would love to go to the moon i don't know about class yeah yeah we would yeah Okay um well I started out thinking, but there wasn't gonna be there's no way that we're gonna have any water on the moon so that's not valuable, but now I think I think that they might be able to make it happen um and so part. "
21253,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship "
21258,310.1,Oliver,,,"um actually teacher oh something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch but i wanted to say thank you for asking some questions about like how my thinking um it's kind of changed because i guess i wasn't really thinking about like what all those other parts of the story but since you were asking us all those questions now i realized that there's a lot more information on that i kind of missed in the story "
21261,310.1,Jazmin,,,"bye "
21265,310.1,Luis,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you "
21267,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21270,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah that sounds great i would love to "
21274,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah she thought it was amazing that they found these craters full of water on the moon i never imagined there being water up there it is so cool "
21281,310.1,Chris,,"i really liked how you pointed out that they did find water and that they found water in craters because that's exactly right that's where they found the water but i was wondering student ","um i uh huh "
21285,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i think the name i heard was um listen we're better "
21287,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i said something different i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21291,310.1,Oliver,,,"i saw the same thing about the microscope "
21297,310.1,Oliver,,,"well how can you find something if you can't see it "
21302,310.1,Oliver,,,"wow reach every reader thats so cool "
21305,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um yeah so i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks because if they're scientists up on the moon they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure "
21307,310.1,Jazmin,,,"to breathe "
21311,310.1,Chris,,,"water is h two o "
21313,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah it's hydrogen then the always oxygen because when i i went to nasa and i saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment "
21318,310.1,Chris,,,"ah um yeah i can see that "
21323,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah but i like even how your mind was thinking about other types of equipment that scientists use that shows that it's something that really interests you and i really liked it that's where your ","what okay um i just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but i don't know how i want to know that i'm otherwise like if you didn't tell us i think what i'm still a microscope because i didn't know any of that "
21330,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh i just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how the lunar orbiter works and how the question works to that was so helpful when you helped us see the difference between finding the water and seeing a water thank you so much for teaching us today "
21332,310.1,Farrah,,,"hello "
21334,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're so excited to work with you "
21337,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21340,310.1,Luis,,,"that sounds great "
21343,310.1,Farrah,,,"well um i just found it surprising that there was water on the moon i never thought about that before so i was very surprised "
21346,310.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah well i sort of like student it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and i really want to go and see it one day "
21357,420.1,Jazmin,,"so i'm going to give you all about a little bit less than a minute just to do that read the question and circle what you think the most important words are in the question ","and i said he is the most important word would be and discover "
21360,420.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah and so i'm just wondering because i know that's the question and my answer was nasa send a small machine and x equipment and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21367,420.1,Jazmin,,,"thank you "
21370,420.1,Chris,,,"okay so um well i circled equipment because well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i picked equipment "
21375,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay well i circled two is that okay "
21377,420.1,Farrah,,,"i circled it equipment just like student and i also circled water "
21384,510.1,Oliver,,"it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question ","um well actually we have to oh i just looked at the clock but thank you for teaching us this strategy today oh "
21388,510.1,Farrah,,,"we're great we're really excited to meet you "
21390,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah i i thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon "
21392,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well excuse me um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21395,510.1,Luis,,,"oh my oh wow oh that's really hard um i think my favorite thing about space as how um pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet it's not even a planet "
21400,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay i said you need a scientific tool called him microscope to look really closely "
21402,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i remember "
21404,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well okay um i still felt the same as student for the answer and the reason they need the microscope as because the water well actually it's ice and it's really really really small like you can't even see it if you don't have a microscope "
21406,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i said nasa send a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21408,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think it said he investigated and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater "
21411,510.1,Luis,,,"um i i i didn't oh okay well i'm my answer is oxygen tanks i said oxygen tanks "
21415,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah that's something i didn't i didn't really read this one but it's just not because i already know so much about space i just knew that the equipment was oxygen tanks cuz how can you go to the moon without "
21419,420.3,Jazmin,,"That, I think, might you might actually learn something new and it might be really interesting so let's take another look in the passage and see if we can find other tools that the scientists use beyond the. ","i i looked at again "
21426,420.3,Chris,,,"well the microscope part that's part three "
21429,420.3,Luis,,,"oh okay i got it i read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing oh it sounds amazing and it's in part two "
21432,420.3,Chris,,,"well to to change my answer so i first i didn't we didn't really talk about equipment in my answer but now i'm thinking i need to put equipment and on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they have to use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits so i would add those equipment pieces to my answer "
21435,420.2,Chris,,"but i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission ","sure the equipment has to be from the story "
21437,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well then i guess i guess i picked a microscope i think "
21445,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the lunar orbiter and then the lunar orbiter used a microscope Okay um well, I would say to discover water on the moon scientist used a lunar orbiter with a microscope. Oh Okay, well, I think what's different is I added I added the other piece, so that it had it had all the pieces, instead of just one piece. oh i'm so sorry i really want to keep going because this class is really fun but i looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now "
21448,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah we're getting hungry so but before we go i just i really wanted to say thank you so much for coming and for listening to all of our responses and helping us understand what were the pieces from the story that we could pull out and and how they fit together on that was really helpful to remember we had to find them in the story "
21451,420.2,Luis,,,"um i'm good ms teacher but um excuse me i shouldn't be here i already know all about space "
21455,420.2,Chris,,,"i thought about how they're looking for water on the moon is pretty cool "
21460,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i guess that they're that they i don't know i guess i wasn't really thinking about interesting or just kind of answering the question "
21465,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um well i guess i do think it's interesting that they're looking for water on the moon cause i don't know if they expect that we're going to have to like live on the moon you know because if we destroy our earth then we can't live here i don't know "
21469,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i mean i'd like to live on the moon but i don't think that we can and i would rather that we take care of the earth that we have "
21472,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i mean that'd be pretty cool you know and then i could just kind of look down at earth and i can be like hey class down there i'm just chilling up here even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do "
21479,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay um what did the scientists what did the scientists use to find water on the moon oh yeah okay that's mine "
21484,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um i guess i was let me try something different what did this scientists from nasa use to define water on the moon i guess that similar to um farrah's you know i feel like i answered this question so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
21487,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i said nasa sent a small machine "
21493,430.2,Jazmin,,"but i'm worried that that's not the whole story could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that ","More evidence? i mean i could say the rest of the sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is that enough "
21498,430.2,Oliver,,,"okay yeah i was saying i was thinking well it says it'll land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so i mean on one hand that means that it's looking for it but then my answer was about the microscope cause then it says you know at the end you know the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that was my answer "
21504,310.1,Chris,,"so awesome that you found that really specific name for the tool right that microscopic water and you need a special instrument in order to find it ","i was i actually found my information in the first paragraph because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon "
21506,310.1,Chris,,,"oh i said that they found craters full of water on the moon "
21510,410.2,Chris,,"yeah i'm worried that the response doesn't actually answer the question ","um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment i forgot the equipment part "
21514,410.2,Luis,,,"nah but i'm ok "
21516,410.2,Chris,,,"um i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know i went to nasa so i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21518,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
21522,430.2,Oliver,,"i'm concerned that your response isn't focused on the reading in this case so i would suggest you go back and try to find evidence from this particular reading that would answer this question ","yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay "
21526,430.2,Luis,,,"excuse me ah i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
21528,430.2,Luis,,,"okay "
21532,430.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah so um oh man teacher i don't remember what we were saying before we went on our break "
21536,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah so i i thought it was a microscope because i read this part where it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21541,420.3,Farrah,,"Okay cool so I can hear the specific evidence from that you use your response it's clear in the text where you got that from i would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery ","okay i know you had told student that he didn't have the whole story so i went back because we have the same answer but i don't see i feel like it answers all the parts to the questions the who and the what and the why i mean i guess i could add about to look really closely at the water do you want me to like do i have to say water in the answer "
21546,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well i know i didn't have equipment in my answer so i had to add that um but for farrah's answer i guess she is saying the equipments and she's got her action word that they're looking really closely um maybe it is water part she she has to add a detail about the water itself maybe i'm still confused "
21550,420.3,Jazmin,,,"no cuz that's why i have my answer the small machine because that's they sent that first i think "
21552,420.3,Jazmin,,,"because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits right "
21555,420.3,Oliver,,,"well i since you were telling student the thing that she said was was the right one then i think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter "
21560,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay let me see um well because i thought it was a microscope but then student just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit so i think it's the lunar orbiter not the microscope maybe "
21570,420.2,Oliver,,"so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text. ","okay okay so in the first paragraph that's what student had said but there is no equipment in that one um so in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate okay um the lunar orbiter will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater well then that's why i think that's the right answer cuz cuz it's looking for the ice deposit and that's what the question is asking us what what equipment are used to look for the water "
21572,420.2,Oliver,,,"um okay so i was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at but now i think it's the lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with "
21578,420.2,Chris,,,"okay um i think i didn't even think about that second paragraph because of i was looking for water but now i guess now well because both student and student have the lunar orbiter and it does say it's looking for ice deposits so i think that's it too i think that's the right one and you know what teacher um i read that there might be a base on the moon by 2024 um so maybe maybe they the do need to find the water so that they can like start drilling for water or something "
21584,520.1,Chris,,"so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this ","me okay well i guess i'd make sure that i i have all of the parts to the question in my answer because i forgot about the first part yeah so i think that's what i do is have all the parts of the question in my answer "
21590,520.1,Luis,,,"okay um okay so i think i'll say that scientists use a lot of equipment to discover water on the moon like the lunar orbiter yeah i like okay that's my answer "
21594,530.1,Luis,,"okay so what was different about that answer versus your first response ","well i i i use the name of the equipment from the story because instead of my background knowledge and i added the part about discovering water because that was in the question like student said "
21598,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um well i kept the part i put about nasa cuz that's in the story too so he said scientists and i said nasa so i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
21603,520.1,Jazmin,,"what do you think will stick with you for the next time you're answering a similar question ","hmm what would stick with me is that i have to say the name of the thing and to put more of the details from the story in my answer or from the question in my answer "
21606,530.1,Oliver,,"student what about you how did your answer change when you were able to revise it ","i'm so sorry to interrupt you again teacher but it's time for us to go to lunch "
21610,530.1,Oliver,,,"but i wanted to say you know thanks for for asking us some really good questions cuz i i hadn't really thought about like why would i change my answer and how would i change my answer i was just trying to make it more of a right answer based on what what student and student said and then you were like okay student but i want to hear from all of the story and not just from about the people and so then i had to kind of like go back to the story you know and try to figure out um yeah oh why so "
21614,530.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
21616,530.1,Farrah,,,"great we're really excited to work with you today "
21619,530.1,Luis,,,"oh excuse me excuse me "
21621,530.1,Luis,,,"i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21624,530.1,Farrah,,,"yes that's what i said "
21626,530.1,Farrah,,,"well i i guess i thought the microscope was that tool because um how how can you find something if you can't even see it "
21630,530.1,Farrah,,,"okay well um paragraph two it says there's a small machine and it goes to the craters "
21632,530.1,Farrah,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
21634,530.1,Farrah,,,"okay "
21636,530.1,Farrah,,,"they i guess they use the lunar orbiter to discover it "
21638,530.1,Oliver,,,"oh i think so um but i guess um i don't know how i would have picked that i think i think i still i still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two "
21641,530.1,Oliver,,,"oh well yeah we we know what a microscope is we use it in science class "
21647,530.1,Oliver,,,"i mean i guess i get it now i get that i got that the lunar orbiter is is how you'll find the water but i guess what i'm saying is i don't know if i would have been able to find that on my own "
21650,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah ok it says okay water on the moon is a desert "
21652,530.1,Chris,,,"oh well um a desert it's really dry "
21654,530.1,Chris,,,"well water i guess "
21657,530.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah so my answer was the small the small the small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21661,530.1,Chris,,,"well i guess it's that lunar orbiter "
21666,420.2,Jazmin,,"very good alright student um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it i want you to be a little more specific so you told me that nasa sent a small machine which is absolutely true can you tell me what that small machine was called ","well we said it already it's the lunar orbiter That was it? "
21669,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so i just have to say the name "
21671,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh wow ok "
21673,420.2,Chris,,,"oh well okay i thought of some more some more information "
21676,420.2,Chris,,,"and because i am i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21678,420.2,Luis,,,"they sure do "
21681,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i think i get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water "
21683,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock out we have to go to lunch right now "
21686,420.2,Oliver,,,"before before we go i wanted to say thank you because you really helped us understand the question and how we needed the tool for discovering the water and that really helped me see why my answer wasn't quite the right answer and so thank you so much for helping us understand that "
21690,420.2,Luis,,,"well actually i wanted to say i shouldn't be in this room already know all about space "
21692,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah i can definitely help out "
21694,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something "
21699,420.2,Farrah,,,"um so sometimes equipment could be something old but sometimes it could be maybe something you wear on your body "
21704,420.2,Oliver,,,"so actually in the text it says the water because we know that are looking for water is really really really really really small so they can't just look at it they need equipment to help them find it "
21708,420.2,Farrah,,,"um so me and student um we had the same answer and it was the microscope um yeah we agreed it's the microscope on because you can't look at it at the water without the microscope so i don't understand why is our answer wrong "
21712,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh well i mean i guess i thought they did on yeah i thought so but maybe maybe not since you're asking about it "
21714,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah we use them in science class "
21717,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21719,420.2,Chris,,,"uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe "
21722,420.2,Chris,,,"oh they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms they're all white they're kind of poofy um they've got a big kind of backpack looking thing on the back and then they've got the helmet with the with the circle of glass that you can see through "
21726,420.2,Farrah,,,"it seems like that'd be pretty hard "
21732,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said and i found this in the story that nasa they sent a small machine to help them find the water "
21734,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i found it in paragraph number two "
21737,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that student was talking about so it sounds like they might need another tool instead "
21740,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i agree but i'm also um i don't really know how i would have figured that out if student hadn't told us about the suits and things how would i have figured that out just on my own "
21745,420.2,Luis,,,"um well i mean it helps to know a lot about space like me and i guess student he kind of knows a lot about space too but i would say when you read about space just try to like picture it in your head and really see it um come to life and then you can imagine the astronauts calling them microscopes um or using the machine or orbiting the moon or all of that stuff just picture it in your head student come on "
21748,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well actually i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful thank you so much "
21751,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely "
21754,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21756,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah oh ok that's fine "
21761,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so actually i circled the same as student about the microscopes and she she showed us the part in part three where it talks about arm a water being microscopic um and let's see what else does it say um yeah so you wouldn't be able to see it as if you were looking straight at it "
21763,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21766,310.1,Oliver,,"so just using that one sentence student and i'm really glad that you're making sure that you prove your answer with a point that one sentence you just read you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","i'm gonna look at really really small bits of water "
21769,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah thank you so i i kind of disagree about this microscope part and in my answer it was that necessity to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21771,310.1,Chris,,,"okay can i try "
21773,310.1,Chris,,,"okay well so there's the microscope and there's the lunar orbiter thing and let me see okay well i'm here in the text it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate on and oh i don't know they both sound like really good answers "
21776,310.1,Chris,,,"what it says okay this is from the text it says investigate "
21778,310.1,Luis,,,"oh i know um can i go can i go "
21780,310.1,Luis,,,"okay okay "
21782,310.1,Chris,,,"well i wanted to add on it's really about the lunar orbiter but it's that on i went to nasa actually so i know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21786,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah well i was just gonna say that about the lunar orbiter so what it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon yeah because you asked what it did "
21788,310.1,Luis,,,"yep yep yep okay um paragraph two and the second sentence "
21793,310.1,Oliver,,,"well ice and is the same as water that's like frozen water "
21795,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh so that helps you find the water or really small water "
21798,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah um i just looked at the clock actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and find the words and the parts of the of the story that we're going to help us find our answer that was so helpful "
21803,310.1,Luis,,,"um excuse me i should have been desperate i already know all about space "
21812,310.1,Chris,,,"on okay i'm i'm closest to the window and i said microscope and i think it's because in part three it says the water is microscopic so that means you can't see it without a microscope okay um my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon on and i found my evidence in part one um it says that scientists found evidence of water in the moon's polar craters "
21817,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay my answer is nasa center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21819,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um well since i'm in this class "
21824,310.1,Jazmin,,,"makes me feel better "
21826,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i got nasa sent a small machine and i found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two "
21833,310.1,Chris,,"you also made sure that it matched lunar orbit orbiter which has to do with the moon so i lovehow you really use the key vocabulary to help you find your answer so really great job ","oh well so this isn't what i said for number one but now i realized number one is talking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21836,310.1,Chris,,,"mm hmm okay so well first i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true but when i talked to student and student they both were talking about equipment on so since you said student had the right answer i think it's a lunar orbiter "
21840,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i'm not sure i think my first answer is right but um i know it doesn't say equipment but i don't really know what the equipment is i just listened to student "
21843,310.1,Oliver,,"i love how you both had different opinions and said your evidence and went there yes student ","on i'm sorry but it's time for us to go "
21847,310.1,Oliver,,,"all right see on "
21851,310.1,Chris,,,"mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon but when i talked to student and student they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is "
21853,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well i just wanted to say um i think i got this all figured out so i'm good "
21855,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i'm student you need equipment and your answer so i said oxygen tanks because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon "
21857,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay well i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water i definitely have oxygen tanks "
21868,510.1,Farrah,,"i mean you're 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text ","okay um my answer didn't change it's still microscope and i circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph i'm okay i um i circled small machine because like student said small machine it's a piece of equipment "
21871,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah i circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21873,510.1,Farrah,,,"well actually i'm i'm still kind of confused "
21875,510.1,Oliver,,,"on yeah i'm confused too because while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and i don't know what the right answer is "
21882,510.1,Oliver,,,"and well it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water because you can't see it without the microscope "
21885,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 24 "
21892,510.1,Oliver,,,"that explanation makes sense but they're just describing the water um but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go on but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much because you really explained what each one of us need to work on and give us a really good ideas for how to think about the text and the question and a new way thank you so much "
21895,510.1,Luis,,,"oh well actually well i was just gonna say i i shouldn't even be in this class because i already know all about space "
21900,510.1,Luis,,,"um well um okay well um i guess it's um i didn't circle anything in the reading um but i just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon i know they need oxygen tanks 100 "
21902,510.1,Luis,,,"wow they need the tanks to stay alive while they discover water on the moon "
21905,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah probably "
21911,510.1,Farrah,,,"well okay i think student has a good point about how the astronauts probably used to the oxygen tanks but i think for discovering the water i found a different tool which is on the microscope and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21913,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so it's in part three "
21915,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21919,510.1,Farrah,,,"well i guess i just kind of thought when they said you would need that it meant the scientists would need a microscope "
21923,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i think for us right the scientists don't need this "
21927,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh whoa okay i i didn't even think of that that's so interesting so the scientists they didn't need a microscope "
21936,510.1,Jazmin,,,"and okay so nasa such a small machine and and let me say and it says them a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
21938,510.1,Jazmin,,,"i think oh i said i know this okay it says it looks for ice deposits "
21941,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah because i was just frozen water "
21946,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah cuz i think with what you said with the part student read it says nasa nasa scientists war machine "
21948,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah well actually student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
21951,510.1,Chris,,,"know the story the story just says the small machine and the microscope "
21954,510.1,Chris,,,"right right right yeah yeah i heard you talking about that was so valuable for yeah thank you for reminding me "
21958,510.1,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm so sorry um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read the text really closely and understand the really small differences between between the the microscope and the lunar orbiter that was so helpful "
21962,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah well actually i was just gonna say that i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21965,510.1,Luis,,,"um well i just i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water they are definitely using oxygen tanks "
21969,430.2,Luis,,"which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text i suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or nasa us to discover water ","okay um i guess i should read it yeah okay "
21972,430.2,Jazmin,,,"ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2 "
21976,430.2,Jazmin,,"perfect i love how you identified that nasa sends a small machine and i think you're on the right track to the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used ","okay it says it's called a lunar orbiter "
21979,430.2,Farrah,,,"can i go next because i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21981,430.2,Farrah,,,"on part three "
21983,430.2,Farrah,,,"ya there's a sentence it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where i found it "
21987,430.3,Farrah,,"i think it's great that you're identifying that as non scientists we would need a microscope in order to see that water right but what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at nasa used a microscope right and so what i suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what nasa and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water ","okay i can try that "
21989,430.3,Chris,,,"yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning paragraph one it says um well let me find it okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
21992,310.1,Chris,,"that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right ","yeah exactly it's all about the water "
21995,430.1,Chris,,"what was the equipment that they use to find the water so this answers the question the fact where they found the water not what they use to find the water so i just suggest kind of going back into the text and looking at what equipment was used to find the water ","yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21999,430.2,Chris,,"because some other classmates might not have that context right and so this exercise is specifically what this article says the scientists use ","so it has to be in the story "
22001,420.2,Chris,,"yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story ","oh okay yeah i understand "
22003,420.2,Luis,,,"okay so um i found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as mike ruskell um so i guess i'd probably say those two things "
22007,420.2,Luis,,,"oh um water "
22010,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well i just i realized it's time for us to go now but thank you for taking the time to work with us "
22014,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm good "
22016,420.2,Luis,,,"um the answer is the lunar orbiter "
22019,420.2,Luis,,,"um no i don't know i just figured it was lunar orbiter from listening to the conversation "
22023,420.2,Jazmin,,,"and okay i can try so the lunar orbiter it says in the story they use it to investigate but the microscope it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i don't think that means that the astronauts actually used one on the moon "
22026,420.2,Farrah,,,"um i have a question yes so my question is if there's no microscope on the moon how how can you discover something if you can't see it if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope "
22031,420.2,Farrah,,,"um i'm still kind of confused "
22033,420.2,Farrah,,,"so there's no people it's just the machine "
22036,420.2,Farrah,,,"that's really cool i i wish the story said that "
22039,420.2,Oliver,,,"that's so cool um yeah so i i understand that now that makes a lot of sense what you said about the lunar orbiter how we can just do it without a microscope so they don't really need a separate microscope but um i don't know how i would have figured that out on my own "
22042,420.2,Oliver,,,"um nasa "
22045,420.2,Oliver,,,"haha ok ok that's like the part student read that says scientists sent a small machine "
22047,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh so is class using a microscope "
22051,420.2,Oliver,,,"that's really cool and i would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22055,420.2,Luis,,,"um ok so my thinking changed because well my first answer um didn't come from the story and i guess i hadn't read it very closely and then when i read it um closer i found equipment that was actually in the story "
22060,420.2,Chris,,,"on my thinking it changed because first i didn't know it had to be about equipment but then when you pointed out for me to look again i realized i had to talk about equipment "
22065,420.2,Farrah,,,"on okay my thinking changed because i thought it was the microscope but then when you explained how it works and when you said i had to look for what the scientists used that's how we can know lunar orbiter is the right answer and i i looked at the clock just now and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping each one of us understand what we could do to help make our answer even better "
22067,420.2,Farrah,,,"hello hello how are you today "
22069,420.2,Farrah,,,"we're great we're so excited for your class "
22071,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh we all read it we all just read it "
22073,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space "
22077,420.2,Chris,,,"i can i can i "
22079,420.2,Chris,,,"so the article is about how nasa and the scientists they used to think the moon was a desert it was totally dry but now they know that there's water on the moon and they found it in these craters full of water "
22083,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh right remember yeah that the water it's it's ice it's frozen water and it's really really small pieces so small you need a microscope "
22085,420.2,Farrah,,,"it it's a tool a piece of equipment and that's why i picked it for my answer because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22088,420.2,Oliver,,,"up well you could use it to look at like bacterial and cells and other tiny teeny things "
22091,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab "
22093,420.2,Oliver,,,"obviously one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes "
22095,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than i thought it was "
22099,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i think yeah i'm i'm not really sure what you'd see but i'm a little confused because we're talking so much about the microscope but i thought we were here because our answers are wrong and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22108,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes this was my answer i said nasa sent a small machine they used to look for the ice deposits in the craters "
22110,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay let me look at the reading okay well it says that they're really deep and they're really dark "
22114,420.2,Chris,,,"well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of "
22116,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah cuz i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and and when i was there i saw i saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22119,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah oh it was so cool i would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon "
22122,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah i could definitely add that to my answer "
22127,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay you said about how the moon is so dry it's even drier than earth i think that's really interesting because here on earth we we need to really focus on saving our planet and our oceans and the water and to think that the moon is even dryer it just it's just really makes me wonder like will there ever be a life there one day "
22129,420.2,Jazmin,,,"let's see i could say nasa sent a small machine and it found water but it's really really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth "
22132,420.2,Oliver,,,"on i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our personal experiences and opinions and helping us find ways to connect them to the story that made it really interesting to to write and think about our answers so thank you so much "
22134,420.2,Jazmin,,,"hi teacher "
22136,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22138,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space and i know that there's no gravity up there so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and a bunch of other stuff too "
22140,420.2,Luis,,,"oh okay okay well i'll be your teacher today class "
22142,420.2,Farrah,,,"i don't "
22145,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah we have them on our tablets "
22149,420.2,Chris,,,"i can go first okay i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
22155,420.2,Chris,,,"oh let's see um that they need a microscope to look at the water um that it can only fill like a couple of cups or something like that "
22157,420.2,Chris,,,"is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things "
22162,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah because we're definitely destroying this planet but i don't think we can live on the moon maybe cause you know we're gonna have to live on the moon maybe in the future or something if we if we destroy this planet because of the atmosphere but they're trying to see if we can live on mars "
22165,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um okay i don't know exactly but i think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know like that we could that protects us or anything you know like how we have the ozone layer here that protects us from the sun well we did until like people are totally destroying it um but that's another story for another day "
22170,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i really am i'm an environmentalist and so i think that everybody's just kind of destroying our planet "
22174,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess that we're looking for water on the moon um so that we can well i don't know why but i feel like i don't understand why my answers wrong "
22176,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that nasa sent a small machine "
22178,420.2,Jazmin,,,"to look for the water on the moon "
22182,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and ","so i just have to add in to look for water on the moon and then i can add some sentences about about being an environmentalist okay "
22185,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i didn't know what my answer was wrong either i said that scientists uh no you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22189,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh okay they use the microscope to look at the water really closely um and how it relates to finding the water um "
22193,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool called the microscope because the water was microscopic Oh yeah that's all I gotta do is just add more sentences? yeah I can I can write down that second part of the sentence in there. "
22197,420.2,Chris,,,"oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the equipment because um student said the microscope and then student said the small machine and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like all oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22199,420.2,Chris,,,"um that they found craters for water on the moon "
22202,420.2,Chris,,"yeah so how do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon ","oh yeah yeah i think i forgot to put i forgot to put that part in there about the equipment "
22205,420.2,Chris,,"i think you could also talk about your own experience going to nasa ","i can put that in my answer too "
22207,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i didn't know that because our last teacher told me that i was writing too much background knowledge because it wasn't connected to the the question in the text "
22211,420.2,Chris,,"well if you can try and find a way to connect it to what you read in the text so you have this experience with nasa and learning about the equipment ","yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now "
22213,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so we'll have to see you next time okay "
22215,420.2,Oliver,,,"bye "
22217,420.2,Luis,,,"hi uh teacher i think i figured it all out now so i'm all good "
22219,420.2,Luis,,,"okay i heard you telling student and student and student that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that and so i think i can go back to my desk "
22221,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah well i said that scientists use oxygen tanks "
22224,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah well i mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there "
22228,420.2,Luis,,,"ah ok so maybe i didn't like read read the article you know so i don't really know "
22230,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay i guess i can do that "
22235,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah okay so for mine i said i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment including oxygen tanks and masks and suits but they used a small machine and a microscope to look at the water on the moon because it was microscopic "
22238,420.2,Chris,,"So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place? ","oh i don't know if the story told us why they were doing that "
22241,420.2,Chris,,,"um i don't know because at first i thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense i did i did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22243,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't think that we can live on the moon i don't think that that wouldn't make sense "
22245,420.2,Jazmin,,,"because like i said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us we will die "
22248,420.2,Jazmin,,,"you mean like spacesuits "
22251,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um well i mean i guess i wouldn't die but i wouldn't want to like you know like live in a space suit like all the time that would be like really uncomfortable "
22254,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i'm still confused "
22257,420.2,Farrah,,,"well okay so student said that in his answer it was the small machine and the microscope but i thought that the microscope was the right answer "
22260,420.2,Farrah,,,"i have i had the small machine as my answer and that one i think was right too "
22262,420.2,Farrah,,,"which one is right then the microscope or jazmin's "
22266,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh ok ok so then i should i have to put both of them in my answer "
22275,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well i've just been kind of listening to what class else was saying um so i haven't changed mine yet um um i guess i don't have as much background knowledge as the rest of them because you know i don't really like read books about space and stuff like i fly on airplanes but i don't like like read about the moon or like the environment or anything um so so yeah i guess um uh huh "
22278,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah well i had circled the same thing as student i circled that last sentence in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22280,420.2,Oliver,,,"the small machine that student said "
22283,420.2,Oliver,,"yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why we would need to look for water on the moon ","okay so add in the name add in the part that student said add in why we're looking for water and what was the last thing you said "
22286,420.2,Jazmin,,,"maybe living on the moon is that one of the ones "
22289,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh oh ok ok um oh well it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch yeah thanks teacher i am thinking though like i do i appreciate like how you you took the time to kind of explain how we can make our ideas a little bit better so i at least know what i need to work on next time i come back to class "
22291,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
22294,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space "
22298,420.2,Luis,,,"um okay um well it wasn't really a story but i just know that if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon i know they have oxygen tanks "
22304,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay well i found it in part three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22306,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom "
22308,420.2,Farrah,,,"from earth no way "
22314,420.2,Farrah,,,"ok i'll look "
22316,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so well i was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it you need to see it to discover "
22321,420.2,Jazmin,,,"So I had a different answer and answer as NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
22331,420.3,Jazmin,,"I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific. ","i'm gonna try right now i should look again "
22334,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on i wanted to say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks but also um masks and suits "
22343,420.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense all look again "
22345,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that student was talking about "
22347,420.3,Jazmin,,,"um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer so i found a little more and i would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate "
22351,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah i just looked at the clock and unfortunately we have to go to lunch right now um but i know i'm going to do because this was really really fun um i wanted to say thank you so much for really encouraging us to probe deeper into the text and find more specifics for our answer that was really helpful and also you just made it really fun so thank you so much "
22359,420.3,Luis,,"i noticed that class has to work on one specific thing and that is visualizing the text to make sure that you understand it ","well i'm a little bit i can try "
22361,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yes i do "
22363,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and spanish word for me is luna "
22365,420.3,Luis,,,"so yeah it's got all the lunar thing in it um but i shouldn't even be in this class i know all about space "
22370,420.3,Oliver,,,"and ok i see the word pole "
22372,420.3,Oliver,,,"i'm like the north pole "
22374,420.3,Oliver,,,"like on the top and the bottom "
22384,420.3,Farrah,,"So I draw that out, and I draw my craters and then I look at the paragraph again, what is this paragraph, telling us. ","okay so this paragraph it tells us well i guess we learned that the loon has poles and that that's where the water is in the craters "
22386,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well the craters they're dark "
22388,420.3,Chris,,,"and the water "
22393,420.3,Jazmin,,,"so this is this is where i found my answer actually to the question we learned that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22395,430.2,Jazmin,,"okay so i want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again ","okay well it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22398,430.2,Jazmin,,,"well i don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it it can find that ice in the craters "
22400,430.2,Chris,,,"think it's nasa and oh actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22404,430.2,Chris,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
22406,430.2,Chris,,,"oh well i think student said it goes in the craters and finds the the water "
22408,430.2,Chris,,,"that i got a shirt with that picture on it and everything "
22416,430.2,Luis,,,"so i think nasa because that's who's doing this but also i just i just looked at our clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say this was so cool like the drawing you made that really helped me sort of see that text in my mind and i think since i love space so much next time i read about space i'm going to do that same thing and draw myself a picture to help me understand it "
22419,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22424,430.2,Farrah,,,"yes i can do that "
22426,430.2,Farrah,,,"it was in part three where we found it it says the water they found us microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and then it says our answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22430,430.2,Oliver,,,"yeah well since i was thinking the same thing as student they're using the microscope to be able to see the tiny pieces of ice "
22435,430.2,Jazmin,,,"so i'm sorry you two but i disagree because my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why that answer is wrong "
22437,430.2,Jazmin,,,"let me see the first sentence in part two "
22439,430.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22441,430.2,Luis,,,"lunar orbiter "
22445,430.2,Jazmin,,,"okay well so the one i picked the lunar lunar orbiter it it had the word investigate it said they use the lunar orbiter to investigate and investigate is kind of like find so i thought they had to use the lunar orbiter to find the water and it says it's in the craters "
22447,430.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing "
22450,430.2,Chris,,,"so can i add something too about equipment yeah well so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22455,430.2,Luis,,,"i don't think that's in here student "
22460,410.2,Farrah,,"but right now we're focusing on what we found in the text ","ok so the stuff about investigate that makes sense i can see why the lunar orbiter is finding because they use the word investigate but i guess what i was kind of thinking before is how can they find it if they can't see it yet "
22463,410.2,Farrah,,,"the orbiter "
22467,410.2,Oliver,,,"well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch and i'm kind of bummed because this was really fun but i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us understand what all the different words in the text and in the question what they mean because that really helped me figure out what the best answer was thank you so much "
22470,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh hi hello "
22473,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22475,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i can do that sure "
22484,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22487,410.2,Farrah,,,"okay well so in part in part three it says that the water they found is microscopic and so you need the microscope if you were going to look at it and see it "
22490,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh well so i guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see "
22492,410.2,Jazmin,,,"well i i had a different answer and maybe will help student so i said that nasa sent a small machine and so and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22494,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yes definitely i found it in part two "
22498,420.2,Luis,,"so i think we can be a little bit more specific about that small machine ","um yeah i got it it said well i mean you just read it it says lunar orbiter that's the name "
22502,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm still a little confused cuz i said the same as student i said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how i would how i would have picked that on my own i think i would still pick the microscope "
22505,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope "
22508,420.2,Chris,,,"oh okay yeah i wanted to say so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22510,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah it was an amazing trip we got to see so many different things there "
22512,420.2,Jazmin,,,"and wait i just so with with my answer about the machine why what i still don't get why i was wrong i said nasa sent a small machine "
22514,430.2,Jazmin,,"yes oh you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific when we're answering these questions ","oh so and all i had to do was just say the name of it "
22517,420.2,Jazmin,,"um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response but it was a great start good job student ","oh okay great that's helpful for next time thank you "
22521,420.2,Chris,,,"so well i just i looked at the clock and actually we we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say before before we go that we really appreciate how you took the time to really explain the difference between finding the water and looking at the water because it makes so much more sense how to find the right answer when you explain that so thank you so much "
22524,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22526,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay well we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon and they found little pieces of ice "
22529,420.2,Chris,,,"well my answer my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there "
22533,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah my family we went up on a trip we went to the grand canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes it was so hot and the sun was beating down and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked "
22537,420.2,Farrah,,,"well i'm i'm a little confused because i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22542,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh okay yes so they need something else first and then they look at that through the microscope "
22545,420.2,Farrah,,,"That makes sense, thank you. "
22547,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i was talking about the grand canyon i was talking about remember "
22550,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i would use the small machine that nasa sent and i would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water "
22552,420.2,Luis,,,"oh we know this i know this "
22554,420.2,Luis,,,"i got it "
22557,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah it's the lunar orbiter student it's right there in the article like right under your nose it's called the lunar orbiter "
22561,420.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22564,420.2,Farrah,,,"well they needed it to breathe "
22570,420.2,Luis,,,"while you you said they had to dig down really deep so i don't know if the lunar orbiter does that or something else does that but they would need something to get under the soil and find the little teeny tiny tiny teeny tiny teeny ice "
22573,420.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah i'm so sorry um i just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how each one of our answers fit into the process of discovering water on the moon like i have a really good picture of all the different steps that they need and how each equipment works and that was really helpful so thank you so much "
22576,420.2,Luis,,,"um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22580,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay "
22583,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well so to summarize the story the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon "
22586,420.2,Chris,,,"um okay um well i guess they had to use some some equipment um like um i think a microscope maybe it said "
22593,420.2,Farrah,,,"well um i don't know if you'd call it a machine really but um i i found the same thing that student um what he kind of just said i think it said you'd need a microscope to look really closely so i'm i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22595,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so that's in part three the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says you need a microscope to see it "
22601,410.3,Jazmin,,"That means that it was really really small, that you would need a microscope to see it. It doesn't really tell us, that specific line, what the tool was called that discovered the water. Okay? ","okay well in part two they they actually talked about a small machine "
22603,410.3,Jazmin,,,"okay the first sentence in part two says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22611,410.3,Chris,,,"well i'm i'm thinking that so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22616,410.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah so i think it's the lunar orbiter because the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like this robot and it kind of does everything and then there isn't like a microscope on the moon because um microscope it's like a really small and you can't just walk around the whole moon with a microscope and look at all of it to find the water first you need the robot to tell you where the water is "
22619,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yes nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22623,410.3,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah this makes this makes a lot more sense now it makes sense that the the machine the lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense "
22625,530.1,Oliver,,"mm hmm so let's just think about as a class like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student ","okay so what we did is we we reread we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question "
22627,420.3,Oliver,,"yes absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text okay ","i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock on and we actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and understand it and reminding us how to use the text to find the best answer that was really helpful "
22631,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22636,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22644,430.2,Farrah,,"awesome so that was a great idea of trying to think about what types of tools scientists use scientists definitely use microscopes that was a good connection so what i'm noticing in farrah's answer and some of our other answers is that we aren't using the actual text to answer the question of what tool was used to find the water on the moon ","um well so i said the same thing as student about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story yeah i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22647,430.2,Oliver,,,"mhmm yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22649,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah okay um at the very end part three um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22654,410.3,Jazmin,,"that particular tool though is not what found that microscopic water ","in part two it talks about a small machine and that was my answer "
22658,310.1,Jazmin,,"okay student i see you located a specific piece of the text that was a good move ","i think it was in there um let me look nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22663,310.1,Chris,,,"well so um so in there it talks about that lunar orbiter but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22667,310.1,Chris,,,"well i guess it's a lunar orbiter um because that's what student said and it was in part two "
22669,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um but i still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope "
22676,310.1,Luis,,,"um i think i think it was the lunar orbiter that found the water um i think because they says it's the thing that um looked in the craters and like found it in the first place i don't know how it works like maybe it's some kind of robot but i think it can do it all by itself "
22679,310.1,Farrah,,,"um well okay so it sounds like the lunar orbiter can find really small things and then maybe they just look at it with the microscope after they find it "
22682,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know "
22685,310.1,Chris,,,"oh hi good morning "
22687,310.1,Chris,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
22689,310.1,Luis,,,"that'd be yeah so um i shouldn't be and as a class i already know all about space "
22694,310.1,Luis,,,"great yeah that sounds awesome "
22696,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i think we're ready to go "
22702,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22705,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay so um it as like a tool or something you use to do something i'm so like in math class sometimes we use a calculator so that would be a equipment "
22708,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so okay in part three it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22711,310.1,Oliver,,"okay very good and this was a tricky one because micro of microscope also has some us so one could think of it as an equipment so i completely understand why you may have been confused ","i was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and i don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why i was saying to you need the microscope "
22714,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I picked it from part two, because it says they use the machine to investigate and I thought that sounded kind of close to the question. "
22716,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i mean their interests are pretty good but i was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks "
22720,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what student said because i went to nasa actually and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits "
22729,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay nasa center some more machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
22735,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm ice it's the same as water um and i i just i looked at the clock and i'm so sorry cuz i really wanted to get to the vote and all that stuff but we have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really understood why we set our answers and you made us feel like our thinking it really matter and that made this so much easier like we weren't afraid to say the wrong thing or something like that so thank you so much "
22739,310.1,All,,,"we're good we're really excited to work with you today "
22741,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22745,310.1,Luis,,"you class are already providing the evidence you class already circled the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the questions so student why don't i just start off with you ","sure sounds great "
22747,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
22749,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah it's right here "
22751,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm so um i mean i already know some stuff and if there are scientists on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
22757,410.2,Jazmin,,"oh i see so you are making a prediction there and you're making connections that is excellent job student however my question here is particularly asking you to find a text evidence from the reading that i gave you so i do not see any paragraph related to the oxygen tanks so even though that's really interesting we need to find our answer in the text ","go right ahead so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar greater these ice deposits are very small and so that's where my answer came from actually i said nasa center small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22760,410.2,Jazmin,,"you did you're so close you told me what the machine is and you actually circled the evidence correctly and you gave me the answer however you didn't tell me the name of the machine ","lunar orbiter "
22762,410.2,Jazmin,,,"oh so just have to add the name in there too "
22764,310.1,Jazmin,,"yeah and you found the text evidence as well you did an excellent job all right you did you did either disappear job excellent ","thank you "
22766,310.1,Chris,,,"and you know okay so up i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon "
22771,430.1,Chris,,"the question was actually what equipment were the scientists using so i think next time student what you can do you can actually circle the question statements ","yeah well about equipment um so i actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22775,430.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah exactly um i like to watch a youtube videos "
22778,430.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i can share so same thing so and that is the microscope i think that answer is actually the microscope "
22780,430.1,Oliver,,,"um okay so it actually talks about a microscope and part three and because it says on water is really small so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely "
22784,430.1,Farrah,,,"that means the moon is still dryer and the driest desert on earth the water they found is micro scapa meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and here's the part i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22786,430.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i found it there too because you can't find something if you can't see it you need the microscope "
22790,430.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much i feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on and that was really helpful thank you "
22795,430.1,Luis,,,"hi i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22798,430.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
22801,430.1,Luis,,,"okay um i don't remember okay let me look at my paper i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks yeah "
22809,420.2,Chris,,"I love the how you identify the word equipment, because that was actually the question you were asking so you're halfway there. and give me the actual word with the citing source then you will get the answer okay okay ","and i think the answer is all let me see what scientists found craters for water on the moon "
22817,430.1,Chris,,"so i love how you a thoroughly enjoy the reading i could see that you understand the text and that really impressed me student really really great job my concern is that you didn't read the question correctly because the question is that i want you to identify the object we're looking for and i want you to do so by circling equipment ","what do you want me to do "
22821,420.3,Chris,,"and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon. ","okay equipment underlying in the story or underlining the question "
22823,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so i circled equipment and i underlined us to discover water on the moon "
22825,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay "
22827,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i thought you said you would get back to me in a minute so i put my hand down "
22829,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh okay well i didn't understand why my answer was wrong "
22831,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said masses into small machine "
22837,420.3,Jazmin,,"you actually did an excellent job catching that nasa sent a small machine however you just didn't identify what the small machine was called the best part about your work is that you understood the text passage correctly but you didn't go back to the reading and tell me what the actual machine was called my feedback for you is that every time you read a passage and the questions given to you i want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me your answer ","and i read it two times i did because i know "
22840,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah the teacher told us that strategy you know you read it you read the question and then you read it again i just i forgot to put the name "
22842,420.2,Jazmin,,"on the machine o h that's okay next time can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all ","okay yeah i can do that that's easy "
22844,310.1,Chris,,"awesome great job explaing that the small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job showing me how you understood the text ","yeah i was thinking about equipment since a circle that in the text and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22848,310.1,Chris,,,"this is my my first time because we we learned about the mars rover and like the things that go to mars but i didn't know about water on the moon "
22851,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i found the answer in the second paragraph "
22854,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um cuz i was looking for equipment right and so when i was reading i only saw two places in paragraph two or they see a small machine and then paragraph three where they see the microscope but the question and i went back to the question and says to discover water right and then in the second sentence it says the herbal will look for ice deposit so looking for is the same thing as discovering i think "
22863,310.1,Oliver,,"I love how utilizing all the words from the question sentence and you're trying to find that word and try to revisiting of the paragraph, I really, really great job so you're correct indeed. that appears in twice in this passage right so that's why it was a little bit confusing but you did a really great job thoroughly reading an entire paragraph and telling me how it actually works to find water good ","no teacher i'm sorry but it's actually time for us to go "
22865,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
22872,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah excuse me i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
22877,310.1,Luis,,"that's awesome i love that how you're sharing your answer with us the beginning of the class and really really appreciate it ","okay can i go back to my seat since i i fixed mine "
22880,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22887,310.1,Farrah,,"sure okay i love that you gave the answer and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word microscope from the passage an important keyword there ","because i was looking for the keywords equipment oh discover water on the moon and this one had it had a microscope which is equipment and then it says in the second sentence the water they found is microscopic and found is kind of like discovered and then it's also about water on the moon "
22889,310.1,Farrah,,,"from paragraph three "
22895,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sorry teacher it wasn't that it was a machine, I guess, my science teacher might see that it is, but I was looking for equipment. because that was the word in the question and i know microscope is equipment because that's what we say when we get out the microscopes and science class "
22899,310.1,Farrah,,,"Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. "
22901,420.1,Farrah,,"and underline to discover water, the moon right. ","okay yeah i feel like i'm i'm still confused because did i do that in my answer "
22906,410.3,Farrah,,"so hearing what you wrote i think you you got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up from the text ","oh but but i did i had all the keywords i had equipment discover water on the moon i'm still confused "
22908,410.3,Farrah,,,"although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three how come that's not the equipment "
22915,410.3,Chris,,,"and i was thinking about the water on the moon and i were reading about them trying to find it and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22917,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah um i read at home and one of my science books that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22922,410.3,Luis,,,"out while i'm and not so much about the moon base but i was thinking about what student was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying student to answer was right the lunar orbiter and that you know what i thought that they had sent the astronauts to the moon and the story but i actually think that maybe it's just the machine and and not the not the people "
22924,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah i'm thinking maybe the lunar orbiter you know is like the mars rover where class in the rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the lunar orbiter is too "
22927,310.1,Oliver,,"good i love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great i love it all right student i would like to circle back ","i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go on but i did want to say thank you for how are you i'm kept asking our questions to class and took time to explain where you thought that they were on track i guess and where they were off track because now i'm thinking about my answer and maybe where i was off track i'm not sure but at least i'm thinking about it right "
22929,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay thanks teacher "
22933,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're good thank you for asking we're so excited for your class "
22936,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22938,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah oh big time i watch all these videos about space on youtube and and i really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity chamber oh yeah i really like space "
22941,310.1,Luis,,,"well i guess um i guess it was from my brain "
22944,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22946,310.1,Luis,,,"i don't see anything "
22948,310.1,Luis,,,"i guess i skipped that part "
22951,310.1,Luis,,,"hey thanks brain "
22954,410.2,Oliver,,"but we wanted to use the text and not our background knowledge ","okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question "
22957,410.2,Jazmin,,,"asking us about equipment "
22959,410.2,Jazmin,,,"well it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because i don't know why my answer is wrong "
22961,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yes i said nasa send a small machine "
22963,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay so um it was in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22965,410.2,Jazmin,,,"a lunar orbiter "
22967,410.2,Jazmin,,,"well i guess i could i could just say that name the lunar orbiter "
22969,410.2,Jazmin,,,"it it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
22972,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh well i had a different piece of equipment i said the microscope and i think that that's the piece of equipment it's a tool and we use it in science class sometimes and it helps you look at really small things like the water on the moon "
22975,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i guess i was thinking how can you discover it if you can't see it "
22978,410.2,Farrah,,,"no we just we just read this we just read it "
22981,410.2,Farrah,,,"i circled it and everything it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22983,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i can do that right before it says okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
22985,410.2,Chris,,,"it sounds like it sounds like the second one but also but also i i went to nasa so i know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22993,410.2,Oliver,,"they do but this is asking us specifically from our reading not from what we know from other places ","okay well this is so i changed my answer so first i said the microscope like student did but now now i think maybe they were just saying that it's really small so if you want to look at it like if i wanted to look at it i would have to use a microscope but now i think first i had to use the lunar orbiter and um i just wanted to say i i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch actually but i wanted to say thank you so much for being so patient and really explaining to us how our answers were not quite complete and how we could understand the story even better to make our answers even better "
22996,410.2,Luis,,,"that that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind "
22998,410.2,Luis,,,"by "
23001,410.2,Farrah,,,"morning we're good today "
23005,410.2,Luis,,,"um well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23007,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay i know they just landed the mars rover "
23013,410.2,Luis,,,"well i know after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks "
23015,410.2,Luis,,,"to breathe "
23017,410.2,Luis,,,"well i mean i guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what i was thinking "
23021,410.1,Luis,,"the question though it did ask us it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to me about astronauts ","um astronauts are a type of scientist "
23023,410.1,Luis,,,"not sure "
23028,410.1,Luis,,,"um i guess it's not really in the story "
23030,410.1,Luis,,,"in my brain "
23032,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
23034,410.1,Luis,,,"i guess the article "
23036,410.1,Luis,,,"and read it "
23044,410.1,Farrah,,,"okay well i found it on student in part three and i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong um yeah i circled that same part student cuz i was thinking that you'd you'd need to be able to see something before you can find it yes we don't understand "
23047,310.1,Farrah,,"that's some really good thinking you're absolutely right there olive that you need to be able to see it in order to know that you found it ","um why isn't the microscope the right answer "
23049,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh lets you see things that are really small "
23051,310.1,Farrah,,,"in science "
23057,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh i remember it's in these craters these craters way down where the sun never shines "
23060,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh that sounds really hard "
23063,430.2,Oliver,,"but it's not the big piece of equipment that we were looking for so can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used ","um yeah i wish we park but we actually have to go now um but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today "
23065,430.2,Oliver,,,"sure does "
23068,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23071,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
23073,430.2,Jazmin,,,"i said that nasa sent a small machine "
23075,430.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
23078,310.1,Chris,,"oh great i love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure it's always a great idea ","i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
23080,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i circled the same answer as savanannah and that's a microscope "
23083,310.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah well so my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
23086,310.1,Farrah,,"I love that a lot of you circle that answer in your text. That would be easy for you to sign and come back to. ","some of them yeah "
23090,310.1,Chris,,,"um i think it was pretty easy to read "
23092,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong why am i in this class "
23098,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes yes "
23106,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah so it's sort of like a whole but it's cooling underground it's kind of like on top of the ground "
23112,310.1,Oliver,,,"well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature i don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon "
23115,410.1,Chris,,"yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using ","yeah well because that was my answer it first about the craters i hear what you mean about equipment on and that made me think about how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use own lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23123,310.1,Luis,,"that your original answer was close but it wasn't quite right thank you for noticing that on your own ","um yeah okay so um lunar you class lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so the orbiter at looks for the ice i think by going around the moon somehow "
23131,310.1,Oliver,,"student used his knowledge of those two words individually to put them together and figure out more about what a lunar orbiter is ","well actually i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question i was so helpful thank you so much "
23135,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23138,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i guess we'll kind of what i was thinking because a question was about the equipment for discovering water on the moon well what i was thinking was actually back on they would need oxygen tanks because how are you going to breathe up on the moon to go discover water if you don't have oxygen tanks "
23147,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah it's really really interesting um and one thing i thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water it was so small that was it's um it's less water than on the earth and it's drier than the dry desert even but they're still water there and so but here's my question is because well i wasn't i didn't pick the lunar orbiter for my answer i picked the microscope because the water so small so i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23151,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated the craters that deep polar craters and that's where they found the ice deposits "
23153,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh oh i'm not so sure no i don't think i don't think it told us in the story "
23161,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i can try it's kind of i guess but i guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces maybe of the ice or maybe pictures or or like scans of the moon somehow and that it takes that on that what's the word evidence back to the lab and then they use the microscope which makes so much more sense "
23166,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well it's actually a comment on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits "
23171,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah well i definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is "
23175,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry yeah um so actually i just looked at the clock um and we have to go to lunch but on before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for explaining that missing step and the article because it makes so much more sense now when they use the orbiter and then how they use the microscope and so now i really understand how how our answers could have been better and how the article could have been better so thank you so much "
23180,310.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
23185,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this space "
23189,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
23197,310.1,Luis,,,"oh in the article i was going to tell you more equipment that i know I know you spacesuits and I know they use gravity boots. in because it's really really cold out in space and you could die equipment equipment equipment okay there is a small machine called a lunar orbiter in paragraph two and there's a microscope in paragraph three "
23203,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay um so i guess i didn't read it that much because i felt like i already knew most of the stuff "
23206,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i understand why my answer is wrong "
23212,420.2,Jazmin,,"let me go ahead and take a look at your answer nasa send a small machine so your answer is not wrong i would just love it if you could explain it a little bit more and be a little bit more specific and see if there's a way that you can use it to help make your answer more specific ","oh yeah i could i could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right "
23214,420.2,Jazmin,,,"the purpose is to find ice deposits in a large polar crater "
23218,420.2,Chris,,,"I thought it was pretty cool you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah. "
23221,420.2,Chris,,,"no no not not not now because they're not close to it yet i don't think um but well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23226,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah cuz in paragraph six they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet "
23229,310.1,Oliver,,"that's right i'm really glad that you pointed up paragraph six that's a good point ","water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting are getting it out of the polar craters making this planet tickle at all so they don't even know how to get the water out "
23234,310.1,Oliver,,,"like oh they want me to study the surface and don't know Cars it takes a while to build something like I have a whole like Lego house and ship and boat at my house and we're still working on it, because it takes a long time to build thing. "
23238,310.1,Oliver,,"i love that you brought up that example that's what's called an analogy and it is a great analogy student ","yes me i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go "
23241,310.1,Farrah,,,"is waving goodbye "
23243,310.1,All,,,"bye see you later "
23246,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23249,310.1,Luis,,,"oh wow i know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
23252,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
23255,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um so my answer is nasa sent a small machine "
23259,420.3,Luis,,"can you look in the text and see if you can find what the name of the small machine was ","i found it right there in the middle it says lunar orbiter "
23262,420.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah well i definitely have "
23264,420.3,Luis,,,"uhm lunar means lunar means the moon "
23267,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah so i think is when something sort of goes around something else "
23270,420.3,Farrah,,,"well i'm just wondering i mean i said the microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23275,420.3,Farrah,,,"so the answer is just both "
23277,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay okay so um i guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer "
23281,420.3,Luis,,,"oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so i mean student have to use both because can you imagine like an astronaut walking around the whole moon was just a microscope just a tiny little microscope i mean that wouldn't work "
23283,420.3,Chris,,,"well i just wanted to share i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23288,420.3,Oliver,,,"well i know that down on earth there's people with like on lots of computers and screens on buttons and things "
23292,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah well i have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water because i wasn't quite clear from the story about that "
23295,420.3,Farrah,,,"um so i just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution so much so thank you "
23300,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be i already know all about space "
23305,420.3,Luis,,,"okay i love watching like the space shuttles take off and go like straight up into space i always watch some youtube videos about that and then how the astronauts can like flow you know "
23310,420.3,Farrah,,,"i said that all scientists know i said you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely "
23314,420.1,Jazmin,,"i see how you found the answer in the text you looked for the scientific tool in the text let's look at the question again let's see what is the keyword that's really important class look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two keywords that you think are important to answering the question ","yeah i think equipment is a keyword and so i wrote about equipment and my answer so i don't understand my my answer is wrong "
23318,420.1,Jazmin,,,"so it says nasa send to small machine cuz i know that the question was asking us to look for equipment that was looking for water and so in paragraph two i thought that that machine was the equipment "
23324,310.1,Jazmin,,"i see how you made that connection ","lunar orbiter "
23330,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah because when you had asked me about what was the words in the question i thought equipment was an important word to so i i said microscope because that's equipment "
23335,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i i was looking for equipment because i thought that was the keyword and i talked about water because i thought water was important a microscope and looking at water in paragraph three so who's right um man student or testament "
23339,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23342,310.1,Chris,,,"it's amazing you can see all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years and then they have some like little pieces of moon rock that you can you can touch some of them and they have all of these other artifacts from space it is amazing you gotta go "
23346,310.1,Chris,,,"oh i fogot the equipment part that i didn't say "
23350,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah i did that part but i forgot about the equipment "
23354,420.2,Chris,,"so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer ","i guess i could just add the two names of the machines that on today in in in in student in student said "
23358,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah student said it was in paragraph three and i see jazmin's in paragraph two i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay. "
23363,420.2,Luis,,,"okay excuse me okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23367,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay okay okay so i said that um that it would be valuable because well water is important because astronauts have can drink the water i mean it's not like they're on the on the on the ground where they can just like go to the store and buy some water or something so and we need water to survive so that seems like that's really important "
23372,310.1,Jazmin,,"i see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space ","i found this somewhere let me see because i thought i underlined it did i did i miss oh yes it's in the beginning okay and i'm in the paragraph four it says watering the most valuable to have ways for example future astronauts could drink this water "
23380,410.2,Farrah,,"maybe you could look in the text for more supporting evidence to show that it could be valuable i'm concerned that your response doesn't include all of the benefits that water could provide to the astronauts ","i'm still kind of confused "
23386,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i guess the right answer cuz i thought that i had the right answer because i found it in the text you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story did because in the last paragraph it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment do you think you'll be a good investment you decide so i'm like okay a lot of time a lot of money my mom always says like that no no no it takes too much time oh no that's too much money so for me then that means no but then you just told student that when she said yes i was right "
23394,310.1,Farrah,,"i see how you came to your conclusion ","yeah yeah so i um well i guess so then there's my answer okay "
23398,430.2,Farrah,,"but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response so you can see that you don't think it's valuable but i would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think ","so can i just write down what i told you "
23405,420.3,Oliver,,"look in the text and find some evidence as to why you think it would not be valuable ","okay i wanted to be in that so i just need to come up with a plan for constructing or getting it out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money so you don't have a plan i am but you don't even have like the time and the money to make the plan so for me that means that that's not valuable because i don't even have it and i don't know how to get it "
23407,420.3,Oliver,,"You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money. ","ok ok ok "
23411,420.3,Chris,,,"i was just thinking about what student said about the time and i could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
23414,420.3,Chris,,,"it's only that's only a few years away "
23418,420.3,Chris,,,"i said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore "
23422,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon "
23429,420.3,Bennett,,,"oh yeah teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for letting us know what we needed to work on and you gave me some ideas on how i could improve my answer oh yeah me too actually cuz then i realized that i could add some more details to my auntie to your meeting okay bye teacher all right hey "
23431,420.3,All,,,"hello "
23433,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you "
23435,420.3,Luis,,,"um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23437,420.3,Luis,,,"okay well i know a lot about space i know all about the different planets and i know stuff about uhm stars that milky way the sun kind of all the all the big ones "
23439,420.3,Luis,,,"um so what i was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks "
23441,420.3,Luis,,,"water "
23443,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters they're full of water "
23445,420.3,Chris,,,"oh sure yeah i could do that "
23447,420.3,Chris,,,"oh i'll talk about it with student "
23449,420.3,Farrah,,,"um can i share my answer while they're talking "
23451,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay because i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23458,420.3,Jazmin,,"so maybe you class can go look at the text again and try to find out how they've discovered the water was actually microscopic ","okay i'm ready "
23460,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay so uhm student pointed out that it says actually that the ice deposits are really small so even though i was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water it sounds like it's not really like that "
23462,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and so i was focusing on paragraph two because that's where i found my answer so it says nasa send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph it says that the ice deposits are very small "
23465,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i think we're still a little confused cuz we were thinking how could you discover something if you can't even see it why don't you need the microscope and order to find it because it's so small "
23468,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so i know this because what the lunar orbiter does it's kind of like a robot uhm and it's like it tells the astronaut where the water is so the don't the lunar orbiter it doesn't even need to see it because it's a robot and uh yeah i think that's it "
23470,420.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah that makes sense but it didn't really say that in the story so i don't think i would have known that if student didn't tell me "
23472,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah well actually i have a comment it's that i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23476,420.3,Jazmin,,,"actually i'm really sorry i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say i really appreciate how you asked us to look and explain how we how we found our answers because that really made me think about how how to use the text to explain my thinking and i think that's going to really help me in the future so thank you thank you so much "
23480,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah "
23482,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher ah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23486,420.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay okay "
23490,530.1,Luis,,"so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how you're thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay ","oh yeah sure okay because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones "
23495,310.1,Luis,,"oh okay so you made a connection between equipment and oxygen tanks interesting ","because in the first paragraph it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and i know deep means like a lot of water because when i go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water "
23500,310.1,Farrah,,"so you have made a connection between deep and pools and then that makes you feel that there is going to be a lot of water on the moon interesting ","um well cuz um well i was looking for a name of equipment and i was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in in a paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that had all of the keywords so i don't understand where my answer is wrong "
23506,310.1,Farrah,,,"um so i i told student but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it because it says microscopic "
23509,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess it can't be like full of water since it's do you have to use a microscope to look at "
23518,410.2,Farrah,,"let's take a deeper look student i really value how you have made a reference to a machine that was sent to the moon so I would want all of you to look at paragraph two, and look for a specific name of the machine and how that machine is use to assess discovery. but my concern is that we still don't know the machine's name and how it assisted in the discovery ","okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits Oh. well okay if the lunar orbiter looks for ice to pass it and the microscope looks at the water i guess they let the ice melt or something and then they look at it in the microscope "
23521,410.2,Chris,,,"it's not that question but i was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon and so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23529,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh okay um the use of lunar orbiter to look for ice and then i use the microscope to look at the water "
23532,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh my mind was going to be different i was just gonna add on to mine that nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice "
23534,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to goal but thanks for taking time to work with us "
23538,410.2,Luis,,,"um teacher i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23540,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah can i go "
23544,410.2,Luis,,,"okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like i told you they can't breathe in space so that's valuable hydrogen i don't know i just saw it in the story and so i figured as important "
23546,410.2,Luis,,,"okay i guess so "
23549,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take and how they don't have that time so i'm like well that's not ready "
23553,310.1,Farrah,,"so i really value how you have talked you have thought about all the costs that are going to be involved in this exploration which is an important component in determining the value of any exploration ","on okay i mean it's kind of like what student said oh but cuz at the end it says like they need to come up with a plan and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like well no because it'll take a long time "
23557,310.1,Farrah,,"okay so thank you so much for sharing your responses i really value how both of you have been able to identify reasons why it might not be a good idea for us to invest ","i'm still confused "
23559,310.1,Farrah,,,"well yeah i mean cuz i thought that i answered the question you know where it said could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story it asks do you think it would be a good investment and so i said no so i don't i don't understand why that's wrong "
23562,310.1,Bennett,,,"okay okay "
23566,310.1,Chris,,,"well that was in the story you talked about how heavy water is and so that they wouldn't have to take them on the on the spaceships anymore so um i mean i guess the benefit is like the spaceship will be lighter "
23571,310.1,Jazmin,,,"we i don't remember what i said oh oh they can drink the water and stay hydrated yeah so you know we can't survive without water so that's why i think it's a benefit "
23582,430.2,Chris,,"to reach a final conclusion about this so i would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question ","so i read there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so they probably are already spending a lot of money to build that and so it would be probably important for them to have water on the moon base yeah that sounds good because then they can read they could drink the water and they wouldn't have to like carry on the water because what if they get more thirsty and they don't have enough water than they could like drink it on the moon okay um i guess oh yeah it "
23586,430.2,Jazmin,,,"i didn't make a response yet but i guess i can try "
23591,430.2,Jazmin,,,"okay um is there convincing evidence water yes the water could be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and then they don't have to carry it on the ships so this and so it would be valuable to just have it on the moon "
23593,430.2,Jazmin,,,"and it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway "
23599,310.1,Oliver,,"okay thank you so much for sharing your response student i really value how you have stated the costs and benefits and stated your own personal opinion at the end ","as well not to add to it but i was just looking at the clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for kind of really making me feel valued with my ideas because at first i thought that when you asked her son and student but you were going to say that man student were wrong but then you said that we had some ideas too and so how we could kind of you know put everything together until i give me some ideas on how i can build mice my new answer even though i don't have it yet "
23601,310.1,,,,"student "
23603,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh hello "
23606,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i'm excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space "
23608,310.1,Luis,,,"oh well my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked pluto out of the planet club because he was too small "
23611,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah me too it pretty much stinks when you're a planet and then you get demoted "
23613,310.1,Luis,,,"that sounds awesome "
23616,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
23621,310.1,Jazmin,,,"if there's water on the moon maybe astronauts in the future could drink that water or maybe there could even be life on the moon "
23623,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't know it's kind of amazing to think about "
23631,310.1,Farrah,,,"Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment. "
23635,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i was thinking maybe discover "
23638,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i thought equipment also um like student did um but i guess another important word would probably be water "
23641,310.1,Luis,,,"um maybe scientists. "
23644,310.1,Luis,,,"hmm what equipment ok we had equipment did scientists use to discover water well i guess really the only good word left is moon "
23649,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so um my answer it was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23653,310.1,Farrah,,,"to look at really small things "
23658,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh um i guess i'm not sure i really thought microscope was the main piece of equipment since i was looking for equipment "
23661,410.3,Chris,,"but we want to find the look at the big moon to find the water, not the tiny pieces of of water. ","okay well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23664,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer "
23667,410.3,Jazmin,,,"oh let me look it says lunar orbiter "
23671,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i totally agree with student here as the space expert in the class and i think it's right because well lunar means moon an orbiter means like it goes around and what you were saying about like the big picture of the whole moon if it's an orbiter it would find the water like on the whole thing and not just on the teeny little pieces under the microscope "
23676,410.3,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before but also i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping those break this question down into the keywords i'm going to use that next time i have a question like this so thank you "
23679,410.3,Farrah,,,"hello "
23681,410.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah we both circled the microscope "
23683,410.3,Luis,,,"um excuse me i i have something to say "
23685,410.3,Luis,,,"well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23687,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah sure do "
23689,410.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah okay "
23692,410.3,Oliver,,,"yeah "
23694,410.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah okay so um when they found a water well the ice actually was frozen water it was ice when they found is it was so small it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it "
23697,410.3,Oliver,,,"oh i didn't even realize i said that "
23700,410.3,Oliver,,,"oh because the ice is so small "
23703,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yes so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23705,410.3,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah let me look okay in the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23707,410.3,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
23711,410.3,Jazmin,,,"well it says to investigate so i guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means yeah, I guess so, so it looks around the moon and somehow I don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits. "
23714,410.3,Farrah,,,"i'm not really sure i didn't really get that part about the lunar orbiter i guess i was still thinking about the microscope "
23716,410.3,Chris,,,"oh yeah i could do that okay so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
23718,410.3,Farrah,,,"so i guess it just it looks in the craters is that right "
23722,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah i was just gonna jump in because i definitely know this one orbiter means like to go around and so i'm thinking the orbiter goes around the moon "
23724,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah well actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23726,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah "
23728,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah like they need the oxygen tanks because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe "
23730,410.3,Luis,,,"um well i guess i said oxygen tanks because i was kind of thinking it would help them find the water because it would help them breathe "
23732,410.3,Luis,,,"right yeah the orbiter "
23735,410.3,Luis,,,"oh no no you can't find it without the orbiter "
23738,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay that makes so much sense "
23740,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah i got it now i can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks "
23743,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah well just listening to what you said to student i see how all the cool stuff at nasa it helps the scientists but it does it do the finding of the water "
23746,410.3,Oliver,,,"um well so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say this was such a helpful class you really helped us to understand what the lunar orbiter does and why it's exactly the right piece of equipment you were so clear and it was so helpful thank you "
23749,410.3,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you "
23751,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this room because i already know all about space "
23759,410.3,Luis,,,"oh there's tons of equipment well they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use "
23765,410.3,Chris,,,"oh well i don't know if i'm a brit from the reading but i i went to nasa and so i i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23768,410.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah okay so when they found the water um well actually what i use and it was really really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes they had to see with the microscope "
23770,410.3,Farrah,,,"yeah so i don't understand why our answer is wrong "
23774,410.3,Farrah,,,"yeah we have them in the science lab oh "
23781,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah so i read in the story that nasa send a small machine and they used it to go in the craters and find the water well the ice "
23790,410.3,Chris,,,"okay so well i looked through the word machine since that's what student was talking about next to that it says lunar orbiter "
23792,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so lunar means moon so you class anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them "
23798,410.3,Farrah,,,"i don't i don't think it explains it in the story it just said the lunar orbiter looks for the deposits in the crater "
23803,410.3,Oliver,,,"um well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers "
23805,410.3,Luis,,,"um excuse me teacher yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23809,410.3,Oliver,,,"i'm doing good i'm great thanks thanks i i want to say mr teacher thanks teacher "
23813,410.3,Farrah,,,"i'm good to it's pretty good day "
23815,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon "
23819,410.3,Chris,,,"oh i figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon "
23822,410.3,Farrah,,,"i think equipments an important word "
23824,410.3,Jazmin,,,"that's what i was gonna say too "
23829,410.3,Jazmin,,,"um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
23831,410.3,Jazmin,,,"okay i said nasa send a small machine and i think that's right "
23833,410.3,Jazmin,,,"ya it's on my tablet "
23835,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph where it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23838,410.3,Jazmin,,,"more clarity um level it i guess i can add more and more words make it a longer answer "
23842,410.3,Jazmin,,,"Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that. i could just put the whole sentence down i could say nasa sent a small machine called the orbiter to investigate "
23851,410.3,Farrah,,,"i think it's a machine because it's like a simple machine that has parts to it that work together so i think so yeah i'll go yeah i thought it was the microscope um cuz that's that was the well yeah i don't know if it's a machine either "
23857,420.2,Oliver,,"so let's go back to that question again what equipment so we want to make sure our answer has equipment discover and water great ","oh yeah i guess not ah i guess not "
23863,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh well i don't know student so you can i'm just gonna read it "
23866,420.2,Farrah,,,"um well where jazmin's answer was in the second paragraph there it says the lunar orbiter to investigate land up the moon south pole and look for ice deposits "
23868,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water "
23876,410.3,Oliver,,"I totally see where you're coming from on the microscope part I think my um. you know i i'm glad you caught the tool component but i'm a little bit concerned that you think they would have the microscope with them i think they're saying they wouldn't need it ","um yeah i i could see that yeah i could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet you know i mean i don't know i don't know as much about space as student it done but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23879,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah "
23888,420.3,Chris,,"do you remember that part of the article i wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding ","okay how they found it they found evidence that water can be found craters are dark places nasa sent a small machine you know what i don't know case it says that they send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate right lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposit so i guess i guess the lunar orbiter is what they use to look for the ice deposits i mean i can't tell if they found it or not though "
23891,420.3,Oliver,,,"teacher and i don't mean to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch "
23893,420.3,Oliver,,,"oh well yeah we could finish on when we come back from lunch "
23896,420.3,Jazmin,,,"you're welcome okay see you later teacher can you see us "
23898,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay let me "
23901,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay hi "
23903,420.3,Jazmin,,,"it was good we had lasagne and chocolate chip cookies "
23905,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah cuz i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23909,420.3,Luis,,,"okay cuz i heard you tell him i'm student and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question like equipment and discover and water on the moon "
23911,420.3,Luis,,,"i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing "
23917,310.1,Luis,,"yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text ","okay so it's not right because um equipment discover water the moon because it doesn't hit the discovery part but i got the equipment and the water on the moon i think "
23919,310.1,Luis,,,"um jazmin's answer "
23921,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23925,410.2,Chris,,"because we're gonna make sure our answer touches not only discover water and moon but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component ","what do you want me to tell you "
23928,410.2,Chris,,,"oh oh yeah um so when i was looking after we talked about it i think it's jazmin's answer too "
23932,420.2,Jazmin,,"you all have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers and i want you to see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move ","i'm still kind of confused. "
23934,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well i i thought that i i fixed my answer so now i have everything in it "
23939,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay okay i got equipment discover oh okay "
23942,420.2,Chris,,,"uh huh "
23946,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i oh i usually talk to student and student if that's okay "
23956,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so um i had class i had equipment know i had to discovering in the waterpark but i didn't have equipment oh well um i had um just equipment crates i didn't really read the whole the whole thing and in my answer that i did i i realized that i had all of the parts but i didn't mention the water okay oh we have we have the same answer so what did you get um ya i had the same thing equipment and water and i guess it wasn't discovered because we there was found in our but i guess i didn't really have find in our answer so did you change your answer um no not yet oh okay well then i didn't i didn't have anything new online either "
23958,420.2,Farrah,,,"me and student are "
23960,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah we're done "
23962,420.2,Chris,,,"you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
23964,420.2,Luis,,,"that would be pretty cool "
23968,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh okay mine was pretty easy i just had to add one part "
23970,420.2,Chris,,,"i'm not really sure if i did mine right but i'll wait "
23973,420.2,Farrah,,,"ya i'm finished "
23975,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well i said um scientists found craters for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
23977,420.2,Luis,,,"i just use jazmin's machine that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon "
23979,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um so i wasn't sure but i heard student and student saying that jazmin's answer was right so i i said um nasa sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
23982,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh i said that you need well i kind of cuz i thought that maybe my answer itself was okay so i just scratched out the microscope and put in the lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool called the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
23987,420.2,Oliver,,,"Okay i'm done. "
23990,420.2,Oliver,,,"uh oh teacher it's time for us to go to our next class "
23993,420.2,Oliver,,,"you too hey i wanted to say that i appreciate how are you i'm you kind of like pointed out like what we needed and then asked us to kind of look back at our enter to figure out what parts we were missing from the question because i think that actually helped me in student cuz i i wasn't sure but then i just kind of matched in my answer the words in the question that we talked about "
23995,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah okay bye "
23998,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh it's going well we're really excited to work with you "
24001,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah so um i should be in this class i already know all about space "
24005,420.2,Luis,,,"um okay well so i'm in the article okay well i didn't i didn't really finish the article but i still know the answer to the question because i'm scientists they need oxygen tanks so they're going to go into space so that's definitely what they needed to find the water on the one "
24007,420.2,Chris,,,"yes i can "
24009,420.2,Chris,,,"so i read that scientists the found craters full of water on the moon "
24011,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay yeah i think we learned this i think we learned this in science because we learned that water as an h two o and i know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen "
24015,420.2,Jazmin,,,"not totally sure but maybe if there's if there's water on the astronauts coudl drink it "
24018,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so um i read that okay the water is microscopic and so for the equipment i said i said you need a microscope to look at it really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24020,420.2,Farrah,,,"like really really small "
24025,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um yeah so i picked i picked something different from student so i'm wondering because i said nasa send a small machine and i thought that the small machine seemed really important "
24027,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh well if said they used it to what was the word investigate "
24030,420.2,Jazmin,,,"detectives "
24036,420.2,Chris,,,"well okay um so actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits Well, the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those. "
24039,420.2,Jazmin,,,"Can I answer. "
24041,420.2,Jazmin,,,"um well that's that's the thing i'm i'm i'm wondering if it was just a small machine were there even astronauts there because i don't think the astronauts could fit on a small machine "
24044,420.2,Luis,,,"that would be amazing i really want to do that one day "
24046,420.2,Luis,,,"oh well okay um i want to look at jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane and i really want to look at that "
24049,420.2,Farrah,,,"well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now one i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening and getting to know every one of us and our thoughts and our feelings about space it really felt like you cared about who we are and what we think and that was that made this class really fun "
24054,310.1,Luis,,"and student i was curious with your response i thank you first for providing that response and i love that you use scientific language like saying the word scientific and tool and even saying the word microscope ","um i have something to say "
24056,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah real quick um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24058,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah um and so i know about my answers right because i already know about space and i don't need your help "
24060,310.1,Luis,,,"um my answer was scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24062,310.1,Luis,,,"well i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks while they go around discovering that water "
24064,310.1,Luis,,,"to breathe of course they can't survive on the moon without them "
24068,310.1,Farrah,,,"well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before student interrupted um so well i picked the microscope because they said the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope "
24070,310.1,Farrah,,,"um to look at stuff that's really small so i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
24072,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells "
24078,310.1,Farrah,,"i love that you're bringing in science class i'm sure you class have done some really amazing fun stuff in that class ","oh um yeah i guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water "
24081,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well the scientists the found these craters full of water "
24086,310.1,Chris,,,"um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24090,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah um my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i think that's part of what they use to discover the water "
24093,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um i think it's in there um let me look ok um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24097,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues "
24100,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i was gonna say find "
24108,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ym yeah i can try and put this all together okay so the astronauts went to the moon and of course they had to have all that stuff student and student were talking about oxygen tanks and masks and stuff but to to actually look for the water they used the lunar orbiter and the lunar orbiter helped them find it in the craters and um i think that's class "
24112,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i'm really sorry but um it's time for us to go now "
24115,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh we're good we're so excited for your class "
24118,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24122,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah well i said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24127,310.1,Luis,,"okay i like the fact that you're identifying a piece of equipment that's scientists used ","um well i mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon "
24130,420.3,Luis,,"would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon. ","um yeah okay um I can go back and look. "
24133,420.3,Jazmin,,"okay and when you find it go ahead and just circle what you think is important for answering the question ","okay i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24136,420.2,Jazmin,,"but i wonder if we can go a little further i want to see if we can build on your explanation a little bit so a small machine would you be able to know what that machine is called would you happen to know that ","um i think it's in there um nasa sent a machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24140,420.2,Chris,,"okay so i like the way that you went back to the passage and looked more closely to see if you could find more information so there was nothing wrong with your answer before in that it gave us a hint at this point we want to build upon it and make sure that we're being as specific as possible and i love how when you went back you were able to find the actual name of that small machine that they sent so thank you student just go ahead and build upon your answer with some of the information that you found ","yeah oh so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24143,420.2,Chris,,,"okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth okay "
24145,420.2,Chris,,,"okay all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay "
24147,420.2,Chris,,,"well i guess i pictured that at first when they said water on the moon and i was picturing like big pools and lakes but on that part yeah that part says it's so small you can't even see it so i guess i guess what i pictured wasn't quite in "
24151,310.1,Chris,,"and you know sometimes we do that when we're reading text and that's really great when we're visualizing it's always important to go back to the passage and check the words and make sure they match what we're picturing in our minds i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills student so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay ","yeah i also i can really picture it because i went to nasa and i found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24154,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay um well i i circled the same as student which was the microscope i think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at student was just reading about "
24159,410.2,Oliver,,"i'm concerned you looked at farrah's answer and i don't think that's the case but i want to make sure you're doing your own thinking ","yeah okay well i'm really that was the part that student just read aloud where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence right after what student read "
24164,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh i'm so sorry i really i really want to keep going but we have to go to lunch now yeah i'm so sorry because this class is so fun and i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really paid attention to every single one of our answers and it was like you could understand why we said that and you could also help us see the right answer so thank you so much for teaching us today "
24171,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah well i think i thought that's all figured out now so i'm good "
24173,530.1,Luis,,"ok so student do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking ","okay well i thought there were astronauts um but now i know there are the astronauts and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now i think those are the answers "
24178,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i found a sentence and and it's the beginning of paragraph two and it's actually the same one i found originally so it didn't change but it's nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and that's what i said before and nasa sent a small machine "
24182,430.2,Jazmin,,"so student is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer so that it paints a more fuller picture ","well the whole sentence says nasa center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i could use the whole sentence "
24186,430.2,Farrah,,,"i'm still kind of confused "
24189,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah about the response because it sounds like you said jazmin's answer is the right answer but i don't understand why "
24193,430.2,Farrah,,,"can describe it to us "
24198,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah that's what it says in the story "
24202,430.2,Jazmin,,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater "
24205,430.2,Luis,,,"the mars rover was so cool "
24210,430.2,Farrah,,,"um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits but the microscope you need to look at the deposits "
24212,430.2,Farrah,,,"as well he then said there's no astronauts so no "
24219,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now because they can't use the microscope if there's no astronauts to look through it yeah I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
24222,420.2,Chris,,"okay thank you for sharing that student now i would love for you to share with me is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling ","okay well um so we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so i should probably put equipment in my answer "
24226,420.2,Oliver,,"I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer. ","yeah okay um so originally i was thinking um you put it find something if you don't see it so you need a microscope cuz you can't find something you can't see but now i'm thinking that the lunar orbiter can find it and then the scientists look at it through the microscope like later "
24230,310.1,Oliver,,"i think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear and it may painted such a clear picture for others so thank you for restating that ","now all we have to go to lunch after lunch time but i want to say thank you for taking the time to really listen to each one of us and why we were confused and help each one of us figure out how to move forward with a better answer it really felt like you cared about everybody's thinking thank you so much "
24234,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24237,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah um okay what he did scientists use to discover water on the moon. "
24239,310.1,Luis,,,"um oh okay yeah there are this circle the evidence and the text where oh that we can use to answer this question "
24243,310.1,Luis,,"awesome so i saw in your answer student that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon ","i'm not really um but i guess i'd caught up circle the word scientists because if there are scientists on the moon they have oxygen tanks "
24245,430.3,Luis,,"But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text. ","okay yeah i can do that "
24251,420.3,Jazmin,,"awesome thank you student use that strong background knowledge you have to find those equipment words Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me. ","oh ok ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24254,420.3,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter and investigate "
24257,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh well i guess it's a machine "
24259,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess so "
24264,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well i i picked a machine because it sounded like the word equipment but maybe if i say lunar orbiter and it's a better answer because it's the name of the machine "
24267,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah well i was kind of hoping i could go next because now that student went i'm kind of confused i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24269,420.3,Oliver,,,"okay "
24272,420.3,Oliver,,,"i can do it um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question "
24274,420.3,Oliver,,,"um equipment "
24276,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay equipment for discovering water "
24278,420.3,Farrah,,,"um "
24280,420.3,Chris,,,"oh oh circle evidence in the text "
24284,420.1,Chris,,"look for those little clues in the text in the question ","oh did did did scientists use "
24287,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24289,420.1,Farrah,,,"that you can't see the water without a microscope "
24291,420.1,Farrah,,,"i guess i thought that's what it meant but now that you mentioned it it doesn't exactly say that "
24294,310.1,Chris,,"i love that critical thinking student i love looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a class go back to the text and i'd like you to yes student ","well i just wanted to share i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
24296,310.1,Chris,,,"circle the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question "
24299,310.1,Chris,,,"oh so it needs to be from the story "
24302,420.3,Farrah,,"so i'm going to go back and check in with student about what he's working on will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about ","okay "
24306,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm i'm okay at work really well but um i just i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space. "
24313,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay so i figured it out from paragraph three "
24315,420.3,Farrah,,,"yes so i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24317,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah i found my answer in the first paragraph "
24319,420.3,Chris,,,"mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers "
24322,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i can read it "
24324,420.3,Jazmin,,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24327,420.3,Oliver,,,"it needs to be a thing "
24329,420.3,Oliver,,,"the questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question "
24333,420.3,Farrah,,,"on it it also says the equipment to discover water "
24336,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and yes i was going to say the same thing is also that i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24339,420.3,Jazmin,,,"Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon. "
24345,420.3,Chris,,,"so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24348,420.3,Chris,,,"okay one to discover the water specifically "
24350,420.3,Farrah,,,"on well i would still say the same sentence i said before you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it "
24355,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh i can see how they might be a little different "
24357,420.3,Oliver,,,"look it's time for us to go right now but thank you so much for teaching us today "
24360,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah well i think i got this all figured out so i'm "
24363,420.3,Luis,,,"as well okay i gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the loan they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water "
24367,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24370,420.3,Jazmin,,,"well it's the same sentence i picked before but i picked it because it has the word machine which is equipment and investigate which kind of reminds me of discover a little bit "
24375,420.3,Oliver,,,"and i got this it has an equipment because it sounds small machine and that has a word like discover "
24378,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay i'm still kind of confused "
24381,420.3,Farrah,,,"i understand the lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense but i still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover "
24385,420.3,Farrah,,,"Oh well, yeah in science class, we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it. "
24388,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh oh no you can't put it under the microscope if you haven't discovered it "
24395,310.1,Chris,,"but i think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question ","mean it's it's a comment related to the story i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
24401,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i'm gonna go with actually reading the story "
24404,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and okay so a strategy for this new question i would say is to really look at the words in the question and find the words that tell you what the user needs to be "
24410,420.1,Oliver,,"of the strategy that we just did with question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for ","and i'm so sorry and i just looked up a clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy because using the words in the question like really understanding what discover matt and i'm looking for a sentence with what like similar words i really do think that's going to help us answer question to why don't we get to it after lunch "
24414,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24421,420.1,Chris,,,"okay oh it's it's so cool okay so we used to think nasa used to think that the moon was totally dry and like a desert but actually the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon "
24426,410.3,Farrah,,"that there's water on the moon but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters that there's water on the moon but he only found very miniscule amounts of water and they did you're right they did find that in the craters on the dark side of the moon the part of the moon that doesn't see the sun right but it wasn't lots of water it wasn't like the kind of water you go swimming in it would it would be something that you view with a microscope ","oh yes yes that was my answer i said i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24434,410.3,Jazmin,,"when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it it was the size when they said microscope right they didn't use the microscope up in space right but what they were using the microscope is when they when they collected it and analyzed it it was the size but they didn't send a microscope up to space okay ","yes and i said nasa sent a small machine "
24437,410.3,Jazmin,,,"yes yes we have "
24444,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah it's like it's like you know after an explosion and it goes oh there's that big that big that big lined up big thing of smoke that goes up into the air that's like a plume "
24448,410.3,Chris,,,"well so i went to nasa and i know that the scientists they they have to use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and and masks and suits "
24455,410.3,Chris,,,"so cool "
24462,410.3,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah we have it here on our tablets but i just wanted to say i looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say the way that you told us that story about how they use the equipment and space that really helped me understand the answer that it was the lunar orbiter and that they didn't just send a little microscope up to that great big moon and and the story really helped me understand that so thank you so much "
24469,410.3,Luis,,,"okay yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
24472,410.3,Jazmin,,,"so the name of it's the lunar orbiter then "
24481,410.3,Luis,,,"to answer from something you read well this time i just started with jazmin's answer and then i used to find the right answer "
24485,510.1,Jazmin,,"what i'm going to suggest to all of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question ","what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24489,420.1,Farrah,,"like a treasure hunt right so what if you could take a second and circle the words in the question that you'd be looking for ","oh yeah i'm still kind of confused "
24494,420.1,Farrah,,,"did that like i use that strategy of looking at the words in the question i looked at equipment and discover in water and in the paragraph where student said it i don't see discover or water "
24497,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i saw that one "
24507,510.1,Farrah,,"so i guess the other strategy that you're going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then you're trying to make some connections between the concepts that you're reading ","is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences "
24512,420.3,Chris,,"so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this phrase that would help you make that connection between what the lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph ","and teacher i've heard that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
24515,420.3,Chris,,,"it's only a few years from now "
24518,420.3,Chris,,,"so in the first paragraph you're talking about how there was there there was water on the moon and now they think that there is water "
24520,420.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah yeah yeah i understand that "
24525,520.1,Chris,,"how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this ","yeah there were two things that you you told us to do one was to go back to the question and look for the words in the question "
24529,520.1,Chris,,,"and find those words in the answer and then um um but then student was like but i didn't see the words so then you said we should go to the paragraph before and try to read that paragraph to try to understand the next one "
24534,510.1,Oliver,,"that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it ","yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for explaining what what we need to work on because you you when you're talking to student and student on tv i gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to so thank you "
24536,510.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
24539,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24542,510.1,Luis,,,"oh okay that makes sense "
24544,510.1,Farrah,,"yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers ","oh "
24546,510.1,Farrah,,,"i can go "
24548,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24550,510.1,Farrah,,,"um i found it in part three "
24552,510.1,Farrah,,,"and yeah so they were looking at the ice deposits the really small pieces of ice "
24556,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24559,510.1,Jazmin,,,"i found it in part two "
24561,510.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah okay it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
24563,510.1,Jazmin,,,"they used it to investigate "
24565,510.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah i do "
24567,510.1,Chris,,,"so investigate is when you sort of look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff "
24570,510.1,Chris,,,"yeah i do "
24572,510.1,Chris,,,"okay so well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
24576,510.1,Chris,,,"um no not really but i saw them all when i went to nasa so i know they use them We have to pick the equipment from the story. "
24579,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well i think we did but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer because i was sort of thinking how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah i mean i guess i guess they use that small machine but i still think that microscope is the right answer "
24583,510.1,Oliver,,,"oh ok so we could say either one That's party cool. "
24586,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah i do "
24588,510.1,Luis,,,"okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
24590,510.1,Farrah,,,"oh no no "
24594,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us make sure that our answers were based on evidence from the text and finding evidence from each different paragraph that i think is going to be really helpful next time we have to do a question like this so thank you so much "
24596,510.1,Bennett,,,"welcome back how did that feel "
24598,510.1,Farrah,,,"hi hello "
24601,510.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i should have been and this class i already know all about space "
24603,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay i can do that "
24606,510.1,Farrah,,,"well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong because well i found the piece of equipment that they used to discover the water "
24612,420.1,Oliver,,"okay so you identified a piece of equipment right and i like that you started off with that i want you all to reread the prompt and i want you to circle the most important word in the prompt so just take a minute and go ahead and do that ","so i picked equipment "
24615,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i chose discover "
24622,420.1,Jazmin,,,"why my answer is wrong because i said nasa sent a small machine and i think that's the machine to discover so why is my answer wrong i don't understand "
24625,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh the small machine "
24630,430.2,Jazmin,,"so my suggestions are that you go back in the text and you identify that specific piece of a quick ","i can go look for the name "
24637,430.2,Luis,,,"um okay so i said at first i said oxygen tanks on but now i also want to add on the lunar orbiter which is the thing that student was talking about so i think my answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and the lunar orbiter "
24640,430.2,Farrah,,,"well i know you said that we had to look for the name of the machine so i'm guessing that that's the lunar orbiter but i still don't understand why it's not the microscope "
24642,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it "
24648,310.1,Farrah,,"I OK, I see how that makes a lot of sense ","well i guess if that's what the lunar orbiter does but i didn't know that that's what it does "
24652,310.1,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24654,310.1,Chris,,,"oh oh okay well at first i didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a keyword like you said so now i said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter "
24663,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh well really like to share but it's actually time for us to go now "
24666,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shut me in this class i already know all about space "
24675,420.1,Farrah,,"what exactly is the question asking us and maybe use some of what we already know about space to answer the question ","okay so i thought a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool "
24677,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job "
24681,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh well this word is actually from the story and it's machine and that was part of my answer nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
24689,420.1,Oliver,,,"what did you discover for that i said find "
24691,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah well i also thought find but i think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before "
24695,420.1,Chris,,,"oh well i don't know if this one is really good but when you discover something it's like you uncover it like it was hidden and then you uncover it "
24697,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah can i share one more thing "
24699,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24705,420.3,Oliver,,"Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay Oliver do you have a question. ","um yeah well that's not a question on i just looked up a clock around we actually have to go to lunch right now i'm so sorry because i really want to do the next part of this activity and i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the question so well i think i might do that same thing next time what writing down similar words that was really helpful thank you "
24708,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah well i'm i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24710,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah um well i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24712,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah well so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe "
24716,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay well i said actually that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24718,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay i found it in part three "
24721,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah ok so the part i circled is okay the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope "
24725,420.3,Chris,,,"okay well so i said that scientists the phone creators full of water on the moon "
24727,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah well that's sort of how i pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like i was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water "
24730,420.3,Chris,,,"on okay so in part it's right at the beginning so it says scientists have found evidence that can be found deep within the moon's creator "
24733,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yes so i said that nasa centers small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24735,420.3,Jazmin,,,"investigate "
24737,420.3,Jazmin,,,"the water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters "
24739,420.3,Jazmin,,,"whoa whoa okay it sounds like it's not really how i pictured it may be "
24742,420.3,Jazmin,,,"water "
24744,420.3,Jazmin,,,"that make sense "
24747,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh i think there's two pieces of equipment "
24751,420.3,Jazmin,,,"um yeah well i'm still not totally sure because i know me and student we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya so that's why we thought it would be just on my periscope because you need to see it and the first place "
24755,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh so maybe the machine does "
24758,420.3,Chris,,,"oh well okay so it sounds like they use that machine and that finds where is the ice and then they look at it with a microscope and also i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24763,420.3,Luis,,,"well the oxygen tanks that's why we use them "
24765,420.3,Luis,,,"oh i know that's one s h two o "
24767,420.3,Luis,,,"hydrogen and oxygen "
24770,420.3,Luis,,,"um i was sorry i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say i really appreciated how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together but also helped us understand what each piece of equipment dead that was really helpful and learning from each other you made that so easy thank you so much "
24775,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24778,420.3,Luis,,,"well i watch youtube and i watched nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space "
24781,420.3,Luis,,,"okay "
24792,420.1,Farrah,,"all right back to the question at hand class i want us when we're unpacking a question to look at specific details of what we're looking for ","okay mine has the equipment but not the second part the second part but not the first part i have both of the parts so i don't understand why my interest wrong "
24799,420.1,Luis,,"oh really great point student student with yours specifically i noticed that you did a really good job naming a piece of equipment and then telling me what it does i want you to focus on the key action word in the question ","i'm okay i guess i have that first part two because i got equipment but i don't have anything about the water in the mon "
24801,420.1,Luis,,,"the oxygen tanks "
24803,420.1,Luis,,,"to breathe "
24805,420.1,Luis,,,"lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um i guess not because now i guess "
24808,310.1,Luis,,"so go back to the text and try to find the piece of equipment that specifically discovered water on the moon right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question ","okay "
24813,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um so i think that the the my the microscope doesn't discover the water but i don't see discover in the in the story "
24828,310.1,Farrah,,"i like that you're looking for that keyword right ","oh oh teacher you're frozen can you see me and hear me teacher oh i'm class are we frozen or is a teacher frozen on i think the teachers frozen yeah i think the teachers frozen yeah i don't know if she can hear us maybe somebody should try to write in the chat box okay i'm gonna write in the chat box oh nevermind to vanish student she's gone okay yeah oh she's back okay um i don't remember what i was saying no oh "
24830,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh um find "
24832,420.3,Chris,,"think about that general idea and see if you could go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover but not necessarily discover ","so i found the equipment because student told me what it was but i was thinking you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24837,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay um so then so i just have to add the water on the moon part for mine case i have the equipment so i can say nasa send to small machine to discover water on the moon "
24842,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and i told you i said what was discovered and i said the were on the moon "
24844,420.3,Jazmin,,,"and i said the who "
24846,420.3,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
24848,420.3,Jazmin,,,"ok "
24851,420.3,Oliver,,,"excuse me teacher yeah i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so um thanks for taking time to work with us "
24855,420.3,Luis,,,"class we are all different people with different ideas i mean i shouldn't even be in this class i already know all about space "
24859,420.3,Luis,,,"wow i mean i i watch a youtube video was a lot about the space and i'm and i follow you on musk on twitter "
24867,420.1,Jazmin,,"So what I want you to do is first find the most important word in the question, but the question is asking you for you to answer it. ","i said equipment i said equipment to "
24871,420.1,Chris,,,"i said discover water "
24877,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah excuse me i have all those so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
24881,310.1,Farrah,,"ooh really great detail with your student i loved how you did all those three steps right you told me here's a piece of equipment this is what it does now question to you does ","it looks really closely looks really closely "
24884,420.2,Chris,,"i want you to look back in the text and see if you could find another piece of equipment that's more closely tied to discovering that water and then for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon so take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that ","okay so yeah i didn't have equipment in mind but i do know cuz i went to nasa that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits "
24887,420.2,Chris,,,"and to discover the water "
24889,420.2,Chris,,,"no i forgot to put that part in "
24891,420.2,Chris,,,"i forgot to put the discovering water part but i did put the equipment in my answer "
24894,420.2,Jazmin,,"hi student with your response it did say that you include a piece of equipment but i think it could be more specific right i think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about ","okay oh it's the lunar orbiter "
24896,420.2,Jazmin,,"exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing ","so i can just add in call it a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and then this is a good answer is it right "
24901,420.2,Jazmin,,"yep and then of course because we're amazing students you want to make sure that the last thing we do is always explain our why and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that ","like in paragraph two i just have to add that right I found it in paragraph two. "
24905,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm teacher i looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um but i do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and and have more full answers because i was listening and now i kind of know that we can add more evidence from the text in our answer and thanks for taking the time that i'm explaining that strategy bye bye "
24907,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi teacher nice to see you "
24909,420.2,Chris,,,"morning "
24912,420.2,Jazmin,,,"hello good morning "
24914,420.2,Luis,,,"um so um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24917,420.2,Luis,,,"that sounds great yeah let's do it "
24920,420.2,Luis,,,"oh well anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff "
24922,420.2,Luis,,,"oh well typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank "
24925,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon "
24930,420.2,Luis,,,"um it says okay circle circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question i'm. in that text "
24933,420.2,Luis,,,"oh i guess it doesn't say oxygen tanks but it says scientists so if they're scientists there's oxygen tanks "
24936,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah yeah okay "
24939,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said yes i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24941,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah it's it's in part two "
24946,420.2,Jazmin,,"it's in the text right you're exactly right student great job connecting directly from the text so this is what we're looking for when we mean finding directly from the text i am wondering if we could get more specific student right so small machine i can think of a lot of small machines right maybe a washing machine right like do you think they used a washing machine to find this right so can we get more specific to help us have a better knowledge base here do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific ","okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24948,420.2,Jazmin,,,"lunar orbiter "
24951,420.2,Jazmin,,"okay great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle student and i think that would be a much clearer response ","yeah that makes sense no washing machine "
24955,420.2,Chris,,,"okay so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24961,420.2,Chris,,,"what equipment do scientists use Okay it's asking what equipment. "
24963,420.2,Chris,,,"no but but i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but also have masks and suits "
24967,420.2,Farrah,,,"i'm to discover water on the moon "
24970,420.2,Farrah,,,"no um i think when you discover something it's like for the first time "
24974,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each answer on and helping each person all back to the question and understand what they needed to work on you were so specific and helpful thank you so much "
24976,420.2,Farrah,,,"hello hi how are you "
24978,420.2,Farrah,,,"we're great we're so excited to work with you today "
24981,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah we all read it but i i don't think i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24983,420.2,Luis,,,"oh well space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe we don't even know we just know we have our planet and we have the milky way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there "
24985,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24989,420.2,Chris,,,"oh yeah okay well i can go so my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24992,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah so i think that was what the first part part one it says in the very first sentence actually scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
24995,420.2,Chris,,,"i guess i was i was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water because craters are really big right "
24998,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay well it says so the ice deposits are like the water actually it's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually student i think it says it's really small it's microscopic yeah that's why that's why we picked our answer me and student we said you'd need the microscope to find the water so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25003,420.2,Farrah,,,"i would say tiny "
25007,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh well okay i said that nasa sent a small machine "
25009,420.2,Chris,,,"i wanted to add to that because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25013,420.2,Luis,,,"um in part one or part two "
25015,420.2,Luis,,,"okay um scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
25017,420.2,Luis,,,"okay okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
25019,420.2,Jazmin,,,"oh i think i can i can do it "
25021,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it well it says investigate and that means to to search for something and to try and look for it so i think that the machine is finding where on the moon the water is "
25027,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the lunar orbiter and i i'm so sorry to do this um but i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say the way you helped us understand what we were um the way you helped us understand what we didn't understand was really helpful because you explained that microscopic didn't mean they had to use a microscope and you helped us find the right machine in the text so thank you for being so clear with how to use the text "
25030,420.2,Farrah,,,"hello "
25037,420.1,Luis,,"so what i want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three keywords and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25039,420.1,Luis,,,"okay i'll take a look "
25041,420.1,Chris,,,"i think we're ready "
25044,420.1,Oliver,,,"i picked up from the question the word equipment "
25047,420.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay well i forgot the same answer as student that is um microscope "
25052,420.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i have my hand raised "
25056,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay um yeah it's student i picked the action that's why i raised my hand and the action and the question is discover and so my answer was about the small machine and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25060,430.2,Jazmin,,"Discover is the action verb that we want to emphasize on for answering this question and i've noticed that, on your answer is like really matches what the question is asked about because. and the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay ","yeah um it's called the moon let me find it on lunar orbiter "
25065,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah um i i have an idea "
25068,430.2,Chris,,,"okay well um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25073,430.2,Chris,,"you should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right so could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text ","well i gues it's what student said maybe "
25075,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah that wasn't the story "
25077,430.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i'm oh this is student so i found my answer in part three in paragraph three where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25080,430.2,Farrah,,,"Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go. "
25083,430.2,Luis,,,"up yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25091,420.1,Chris,,"can class circle one word in the question that you think is the most important word to focus on when answering it ","so that i circled is all water "
25093,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i circled discover "
25097,420.1,Farrah,,,"yeah actually i circled of equipment "
25102,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i guess i was thinking yes because how can you find something if you can't see it "
25105,420.1,Jazmin,,,"um yeah so my answer was that nasa center small machine head so i don't understand why my answers room "
25109,420.1,Jazmin,,,"and i can i can tell you where i found it i found it in part to the beginning of part two "
25114,420.2,Jazmin,,"that's an awesome answer student i think maybe to make it a little bit more detailed you can include the name of the small machine ","oh no i just circled small machine "
25118,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah well i just supposed to work on my scope i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because i thought it was just a microscope and i don't think i want to pick small machine "
25120,420.2,Luis,,,"okay so student the machine is called a lunar orbiter and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take "
25122,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right "
25124,420.2,Chris,,,"well i was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25130,420.2,Oliver,,,"are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it "
25132,420.2,Oliver,,,"so "
25135,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i'm so sorry for himself when he described it this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page "
25140,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh um maybe like after after the lunar orbiter "
25143,420.2,Oliver,,,"um well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the keywords to answer the question and also understanding how to make an inference about the best answer i feel like i learned a lot even in just a few minutes thank you "
25146,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer "
25149,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess okay "
25151,530.1,Luis,,"great so student now that you're participating already would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response ","yeah sure so my first answer once about oxygen tanks which i'm well i still kind of think that's true but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so then i found the equipment and the story which is the machine "
25156,310.1,Jazmin,,"I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer. ","yes um i found more evidence in the text when i revise my answer because it wasn't it didn't have enough information from the text i needed more evidence to make it clearer "
25161,310.1,Farrah,,"okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answer that's a great point ","um well okay i would say i did that too but what i did more was i reread the question "
25164,310.1,Farrah,,"that's a great point student ","yeah i looked more at the word discover "
25167,310.1,Farrah,,,"equipment equipment and discover yeah that's how i changed my answer "
25170,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah i change my answer too "
25173,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah um i cricled lunar orbiter same thing as student "
25182,520.1,Chris,,"so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this first you're going to answer i started out thinking blank then you're going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do ","well first i was wondering is my new answer okay "
25185,520.1,Chris,,,"when i read the text again like a really carefully on and that's how i found out the water was microscopic which is kind of near the end of the story and i think when i read it the first time i really focused on the beginning of the story "
25189,310.1,Chris,,"okay great i appreciate how you were looking at the whole story in a really detailed way to pick out that evidence just like student was picking out that evidence and so was student student and student so ","the question "
25192,310.1,Luis,,,"student it's equipment and also discover "
25195,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i was thinking water "
25197,420.2,Chris,,"water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those keywords and using that evidence from the text can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely ","equipment discover water my answer does not have equipment "
25200,420.2,Chris,,"great i love how you're reflecting on the keywords in that question and you realize that you were missing a little part of the question there so you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good ","yeah yeah "
25203,420.2,Oliver,,,"and i'm really sorry i wish we could keep going but we have to go now it's time for us to go "
25207,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25212,420.2,Jazmin,,,"equipment is like a tool or like something you use to do something "
25215,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
25217,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely "
25219,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i circled the same as student "
25222,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay "
25224,420.2,Farrah,,,"part two okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
25226,420.2,Oliver,,,"in that part they talked about the lunar orbiter i guess "
25229,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah well with with what student just said that was actually my answer i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25232,420.2,Jazmin,,,"Red. "
25235,420.2,Chris,,,"i would say it's like a thin marker "
25240,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so those are some details that you can use to describe things so we know that nasa sent a small machine but what kind of small machine was it ","well it says i don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what student read "
25243,310.1,Chris,,"yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used ","yeah well it's more of a comment actually so i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25247,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well they would have to to stay alive on the moon "
25250,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i can do that oh it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
25252,310.1,Chris,,,"um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice "
25256,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i think it's kind of like a robot and so it can kind of like go around well it's called an orbiter and so that means it goes around the moon and so i think probably they're using like some kind of signal maybe and they scan the moon like a scanner for water maybe i don't know that's what i think "
25260,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah these are such good guesses right and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is ","i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock. and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at and find and think about the details about the lunar orbiter that really helped and finding the most specific answer for the question "
25266,420.3,Luis,,"i want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it ","um i think i got this all figured out now so i'm good "
25268,420.3,Luis,,,"um well i mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things because they said equipment not piece of equipment so i figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep "
25273,420.3,Luis,,"so go ahead and circle one piece of equipment in paragraph number two ","well paragraph two that's where they talk about the lunar orbiter "
25275,420.3,Luis,,,"um well they say it's a machine a small machine and machine can be equipment "
25279,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i say it's like something you use to do a task "
25281,420.3,Luis,,,"okay so what it says in part two investigates in the polar craters "
25284,420.3,Farrah,,,"i'm i'm kind of confused "
25286,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah well you told us to look in paragraph two but what about paragraph three and the microscope "
25290,420.3,Farrah,,,"okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope "
25292,420.3,Farrah,,,"it lets them see the the tiny ice deposits "
25295,420.3,Farrah,,,"Well, I mean it's what Luis said that machine the lunar orbiter. "
25299,420.3,Chris,,,"they say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that "
25304,420.3,Oliver,,,"i didn't really get at first that it was because i thought it was just a microscope if you look again they use the word machine to describe it um and i guess yeah a machine that's like equipment not because at you design a machine to to do something so it could be an equipment "
25306,530.1,Oliver,,"what made you change your thinking on that ","i heard i'm student talking about the lunar orbiter and you said to look at part two "
25308,530.1,Oliver,,,"so i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
25313,530.1,Oliver,,,"they need so much equipment on the moon they need to build the base so they could breathe on the moon all sorts of things "
25318,530.1,Chris,,,"well people need water they could drink the water "
25321,530.1,Chris,,,"well or if there's water on the moon people can live there because i mean they could bring some water but eventually it be gone so they could drink more water from the moon "
25325,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah yes three years away yeah i definitely want to go i'm ready all live on the moon any day "
25328,530.1,Jazmin,,,"and since there's water on the moon maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden so that we could grow food "
25330,530.1,Jazmin,,,"well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon we need some food and sustainable food "
25334,310.1,Jazmin,,"okay i see what you're thinking there ","yeah we not be so cool we don't have like a moon greenhouse "
25337,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah i guess the moon dirt it may not work i don't know we have to try it "
25340,310.1,Oliver,,,"well i just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for really helping us understand the word equipment on and what it means and how to use it on and how to find the different equipment in the text i feel like i understand that so much better now thank you "
25342,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi hi hi "
25345,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25356,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25363,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes yes and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25366,310.1,Farrah,,,"well um i i guess the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really understand why because if you if it's so small don't you need to see it before you could discover it "
25370,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh well um well i thought it was the microscope to just like student i circled the same the same the same thing but what you just said it sounded to me like like a metal detector like the lunar orbiter as kind of like a metal detector and it says where it is and then then you dig out the metal and then you can look at what it is is it like that "
25372,310.1,Chris,,,"well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25374,310.1,Luis,,,"i sure did "
25379,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so you're saying that like it's not the right answer because i'm so oxygen tanks isn't the right answer because that's not how they find the water "
25382,310.1,Luis,,,"i definitely want to live on the moon "
25387,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh that's okay happens all time i looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before before we go you really helped us understand the different purposes of the different appointments and why the lunar orbiter was the right answer for this question and i just wanted to say it was so helpful to work with you today thank you so much "
25389,310.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
25393,310.1,Luis,,"okay i love that you all brought in so many interesting facts that you read about in the article into your responses ","um well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25396,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay "
25406,420.3,Jazmin,,"so go ahead and underline the specific detail where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now ","excuse me "
25408,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh well i already circled the equipment when we answered the question "
25411,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i said nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
25415,420.3,Jazmin,,,"okay "
25418,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so when i read the story i found two pieces of equipment and they're a small machine which by the way student is called a lunar orbiter and and the microscope those are the two equipments "
25425,420.3,Chris,,,"i can read it okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i went to nasa actually on so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25427,420.3,Chris,,,"oh the craters that was part of my answer "
25429,420.3,Oliver,,,"um they found really really tiny pieces of ice "
25432,420.3,Farrah,,,"yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope um so is that the right answer "
25440,310.1,Oliver,,"okay so i think that you class did a really great job of combining all of what you found in the text to create the best answer right student and student you class talked about the small machine called the lunar orbiter ","yeah well we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch but yeah i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for allowing each of us to share our answers and helping us see how each of our answers were like a piece of the answer and how to work together with them "
25444,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi hi how are you "
25446,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're good we're really excited to work with you "
25449,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25451,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i can definitely do that "
25454,310.1,Farrah,,,"on yes we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them "
25456,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i want to go is that okay "
25459,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25461,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah well i would just say i'm actually i circled the same as student "
25463,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
25467,310.1,Luis,,,"Oh um yeah. i guess it's not really in there but i just know i know that if there's people on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
25472,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
25478,420.2,Farrah,,"So I love your thinking, but when you see a small machine and you think that could be a few different things, maybe keep hunting and see if there's any specific vocabulary great question Jazmin. ","yeah so now i'm a little confused because i guess well i thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe student is correct so is she right or am i right "
25483,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah and i just wanted to add what i know to that clarification which is because you said there are no people there on the moon so then they had to bring i bet they had to bring like the little ice deposit back to earth and that's when they probably looked under the microscope right "
25485,420.2,Luis,,,"robots are awesome "
25487,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25492,420.2,Chris,,,"we got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and i really wanted to try it on but and then we got to see parts of rockets and other things that the astronauts have inside the rockets like likes back like the packets of the of the space food and stuff "
25494,420.2,Chris,,,"it looks pretty disgusting really "
25496,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um i just want to make extra sure i understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer "
25499,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yes can i try and "
25501,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so i'm going to change my first answer and i'm going to say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then in parentheses not a toaster and then i would say and then they had to use a microscope "
25504,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i thought that i can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm i just i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for taking all of our answers and showing us how they fit together to make the most complete answer that was really helpful "
25509,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25513,420.2,Chris,,,"first okay i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
25520,420.2,Farrah,,"student i i love your thinking that you really found the the theme of the text and you're totally on point with about the kind of equipment that scientists used, so I think my suggestion would be for you to go back and think about the equipment that scientists were using. ","i'll go "
25522,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay um so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25529,420.3,Jazmin,,"so you're totally right about that but i want to just go back to the question because i'm concerned that your answer doesn't totally answer the question To look at the water they discovered so you're totally right that that was in the article but let's think a little bit more deeply about the question. and not discovery process so my suggestion would be to look at the text and think about how they were discovering the water not looking at it but finding it in the first place ","i don't understand why my answers wrong "
25531,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said nasa send a small machine "
25538,420.2,Jazmin,,"i would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine but the scientists were using ","teacher oh oh okay yeah i see that that's it's just it's a lunar orbiter i just have to add that to my answer and then i'm done oh that's easy okay well scientists into small machine called her "
25540,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay i got it can i go "
25542,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah i circled the same thing that student did you "
25545,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until i was looking in but text for everywhere they said equipment and i was looking for where they're finding and water and the moon so but but paragraph paragraph three had all of the keywords in it yeah "
25553,420.3,Oliver,,"i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery ","okay i feel like i didn't see the word discovery on that's what i saw found in paragraph three "
25557,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay um i think i've found the one that student was talking about but then i was thinking about equipment because you said that's the part that was missing in my answer and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25563,420.3,Chris,,,"yeah thanks teacher okay. "
25566,420.3,Oliver,,,"teacher that's not a question or an observation i look up a time and i realized that it's time for us to go so on we will see you later okay "
25568,420.3,,,,"teacher "
25570,420.3,All,,,"hi "
25572,420.3,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class biology know all about space "
25574,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death second they have to wear oxygen tanks because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there so they got to wear gravity boots "
25577,420.3,Luis,,,"yeah sure okay i said what did i see i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
25582,420.3,Luis,,"you also i see how you're connecting your knowledge about astronauts to this article which is great astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using ","okay okay "
25584,420.3,Chris,,,"i can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon "
25588,420.3,Chris,,,"how they found the water i don't think i remember that part of the story let me see "
25590,420.3,Jazmin,,,"um yeah i don't understand why why my answers wrong "
25592,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said scientists sent a small machine out nasa sent a small machine "
25594,420.3,Jazmin,,,"let me see i'll call the lunar orbiter "
25598,310.1,Jazmin,,"yes definitely i see how you're connecting original answer and growing your thinknig ","i just have to add that i just have that lunar orbiter to my answer and then it's fine "
25600,530.1,Jazmin,,"and then after you're finished i'm curious if you could share about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote ","well i added the name so i had to master some small machine and now it says nasa said it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25602,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i just i added the name "
25606,530.1,Jazmin,,,"it's a machine. that they use to find water "
25609,530.1,Oliver,,,"about the moon that means about the moon "
25611,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know like how "
25615,530.1,Chris,,,"we we like the sun you know like we go around yeah yeah i have to think for a second like do we call this week around the sun "
25618,530.1,Jazmin,,,"um i think it's a machine that goes around "
25624,530.1,Jazmin,,,"okay you're using this to you went around the moon maybe and looked for water like flew around the moon maybe or or or drove around the moon "
25627,530.1,Chris,,,"before the issue the response i was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because i went to nasa into i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25634,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more more with the just what we're talking about in the story "
25636,530.1,Oliver,,,"oh oh teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for how you were asking questions about our thinking i'm to help with the answers and kind of taking time to explain what we needed to work on because it gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to "
25638,530.1,Oliver,,,"bye teacher "
25641,530.1,Luis,,,"wow excuse me i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i'm good "
25647,530.1,Luis,,,"because that paragraph two yeah class that's what it says in paragraph two it says nasa's into small machine blah blah blah look for ice deposit blah blah blah and so they found the ice using a small machine "
25653,420.1,Luis,,"what's the important word in the question ","oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter i forgot to put that in there "
25657,420.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah i did "
25662,520.1,Luis,,"i'm concerned about their whereas a lack of specificity and both of your responses today. so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer ","okay okay "
25665,520.1,Luis,,,"it does i mean i just like don't like to write you know i mean i feel like when i get the answer i got it and that's good "
25667,520.1,Luis,,"Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise. ","okay next time i guess i could just like be specific when i'm writing my answer "
25676,510.1,Luis,,"i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times ","okay i used to think that i just care right small machine or equipment but now i think i gotta always write the name of the thing in my answer because because the teacher says that i got to be more specific so next time i guess i will write more specific names of things when i am writing my answer so you don't have to revise and revise and revise "
25678,510.1,Jazmin,,,"um yeah well i i changed my answer to "
25680,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i did it while i'm while you're talking to student "
25683,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay um so he said nasa use the machine called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon "
25686,510.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
25690,530.1,Jazmin,,"what was different about your first answer and your second you said ","my first answer i just said nasa send a small machine "
25693,510.1,Jazmin,,"i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to your answer do you think that helped you get a more full response ","yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity "
25699,520.1,Jazmin,,"okay what could you do next time you get a question like this ","short um okay well next next time i could i guess well first off i know that i was supposed to write the name of it i guess that's the same as student to be more specific with the name um and then also um what else did i add oh oh the why i added why though the white part because the teachers that's what the teacher said that i was missing to "
25702,520.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay um the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK. "
25710,520.1,Jazmin,,,"i forgot again oh man hold on i was supposed to be adding in the equipment part yeah okay okay i got it now oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon with the lunar orbiter was microscopic "
25713,520.1,Oliver,,,"i know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay "
25717,520.1,All,,,"yeah yeah "
25720,520.1,Luis,,,"i i just i think i got it figured out now so i think i'm all good "
25726,520.1,Chris,,,"um okay well i'm student had had it before so i remembered that it was in the second paragraph and i'm that well i was looking for the ice part of it because at first i didn't realize that was the water too and so yeah that was it was pretty easy to find "
25728,520.1,Chris,,,"oh discover "
25733,520.1,Chris,,"what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking ","i think but i got a mixture of it i'm looking at all of the words in the question cuz i missed equipment on my answer and "
25741,520.1,Chris,,,"oh okay well cuz when we were talking about our answers before the teacher kept telling us that that was one of the important because class else had equipment except for me i realized i forgot it and then when we're reading the question to me i heard it again and i realized i forgot it "
25747,520.1,Chris,,,"okay well for next time i guess i should check my answer with the question um then to make sure that i i answered all the parts of the question "
25752,510.1,Farrah,,"i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide your answer just look over your answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go ","still kind of confused "
25756,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay um so oh let me see where did i even write it down "
25759,510.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because i got that one right out of the story okay yeah i see where i wrote it down okay um and then for my revised answer i said that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon "
25761,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah i wrote a lot more um i mean i wrote a lot more like not words but you know like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story "
25765,510.1,Farrah,,,"so specificity "
25777,530.1,Farrah,,"so how can i ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer how did your thinking change ","um okay so i knew that the microscope was the wrong answer because i realized that i was i had used it because it said it was looking at the water but she was asking about discovering the water um and then we already talked about you know like our supposed to put all of the parts of the question and our answer and i think i did that in my first answer but then i did it i did it more because like we keep talking about like adding more details and adding more details so i guess i'm what different is that i added more details oh i remember and i use more the words from the question in my answer to "
25780,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah and and i added the words from the question to "
25785,530.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah yeah no i think i can i'm okay how do i know what the questions asking um okay so what i would do is look at all of the words in the question right and then make sure that i i understand what each of the words means um and then when i find my answer try to like look in match it up between each of the words in my answer in each of the words in the question "
25795,530.1,Farrah,,,"That. i started to think that i could just kind of find the words in the story and then that just be the answer to right but now i think that i have to make sure that i understand all the words in this question first and then find the answer and write it in my own words to feel match the question "
25798,530.1,Farrah,,,"was oh no because if i don't then i might actually have the wrong answer so next time i will "
25802,530.1,Farrah,,,"check my answer with the words in the question to make sure that they "
25804,530.1,Farrah,,,"oh man okay i'm telling i'm "
25808,530.1,Oliver,,,"all to turn teacher it's time for us to go to lunch "
25810,530.1,Oliver,,,"well i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to kind of help us to think about our answers changing cause i was listening and now i have some ideas on on how to think about when i am going to change like my answer um next time i'm going to enter a question "
25812,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
25817,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah thanks for calling on me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25820,530.1,Luis,,,"i can tell you anything you want to know "
25822,530.1,Luis,,,"okay that's fine great "
25826,530.1,Jazmin,,,"ok ok nasa centers machine called a lunar orbiter "
25829,530.1,Luis,,,"okay so i figured this out because lunar means like moon and orbiter means like around like it goes around and an orbit and so i think the lunar orbiter as like this small machine that goes around the moon "
25833,510.1,Chris,,"fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here ","oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators full of water "
25838,510.1,Chris,,,"okay yeah so in part one it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters okay there's the part about the lunar orbiter oh oh oh okay well i don't know if i got here yeah and part three oh it says that the water is microscopic "
25842,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah um well this is connected to my answer to microscopic means it's really really small and so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25847,420.2,Oliver,,"keep everyone should keep in mind when I hear these answers I want to know, like small details from the text so. ","um yeah well i suppose same thing as student "
25851,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters "
25858,420.2,Chris,,,"well i know what craters are because i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25860,420.2,Luis,,,"oh yeah astronaut "
25864,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well it doesn't actually say the word astronaut anywhere in the story "
25867,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh i just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful thank you so much i'm "
25874,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
25876,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set i got it "
25882,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay um well student told us about part of it but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope "
25885,310.1,Oliver,,"i like that you found relationship between the words ","um yeah yeah that's like super super small "
25894,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm i'm i'm a little confused still "
25898,310.1,Farrah,,,"no about the microscope because is the lunar orbiter the right answer or is it the microscope i don't get it "
25903,310.1,Farrah,,,"me or class "
25906,310.1,Luis,,,"um well i think it's probably both i mean lunar orbiter i mean that sounds really fancy cool and it sounds like it can like find the location of the water and then microscopes are you can see it so um i think it's probably both "
25910,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and so i i kind of think that like the lunar orbiter is like the better answer not that microscopes is bad but i think lunar orbiter says the exact thing like the one thing they used to like discover the water like discover like find it like where it is i don't think i'm microscope could do that because only one microscope won't do a lot on a great big moon "
25912,310.1,Oliver,,,"um wow i was gonna say microscope but what student side as making me think a little bit but i still don't understand how you can find something that's too small to see how can you even discover it if you can't see it yeah "
25914,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well definitely not a microscope "
25916,310.1,Oliver,,,"well gotta be the lunar orbiter "
25920,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i also read that there could be a base on the moon by "
25922,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for class "
25924,310.1,Oliver,,,"lunar orbiter because like you're already there "
25929,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm so sorry because this class is so fun i'm learning so much but we have to go to lunch and i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much you really made me feel like you valued my answer and i think class probably agrees on that and you've really helped us use our thinking to find the best answer and that was really cool "
25933,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah i i did that so i think i got this all figured out i'm all good "
25937,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i think she should just add the name i think she should just say um i don't remember student what was your answer yeah so i think you can just say nasa's small machine called a lunar orbiter and that's a good answer "
25941,310.1,Farrah,,,"um no she didn't have the who and i don't remember the other thing that you said we're supposed to have she has what i saw is it just who and what "
25943,310.1,Farrah,,,"will the question says or what equipment it scientists use so the scientists are the hoop "
25948,310.1,Farrah,,,"um i mean i guess we could still use what student said oh well she said nasa sent a small machine for me she could say um i guess nasa scientists into small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25953,310.1,Jazmin,,,"no "
25955,310.1,Jazmin,,,"get them on "
25959,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm sorry teacher i'm still kind of confused "
25962,310.1,Farrah,,,"well because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the keywords in the question um and so the keyword in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that i underlined so does that mean all of those words have to be in the answer too "
25967,510.1,Farrah,,"the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in your response ","yeah yeah that does "
25972,530.1,Jazmin,,"thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ","okay um so for my process at first i was just looking for the equipment and then you you said that it had to i had to i should say the name of it um and then you asked if we had the who and today anna said no but then she said yeah and you said that nasa could be the who and then we added something else but i don't remember what else we added other than the name "
25977,530.1,Chris,,,"sorry i was just thinking when you set the where that are i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so that could be another another thing i guess not for your answer but that's more information about the weird "
25985,530.1,Chris,,,"scientists phone crude is for water on the moon so i have the who and i have the weird and i guess the what is the craters okay scientists is the whole that's the same water on the moon is the same craters oh okay the equipment is wrong "
25990,530.1,Chris,,,"hey oh scientists sent the lunar orbiter to find craters for water on the moon "
25994,530.1,Oliver,,,"i'm trying to and i love to teach i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted i wanted to say thank you for when you explain what we needed to work on and you you help me think about my strategy um i didn't even notice about like thinking about like who and what and the were in the question and trying to match it to my answer so i think that was really useful for me "
25996,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye teacher "
25999,530.1,Farrah,,,"hi we're great we're so excited to work with you "
26001,530.1,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26003,530.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah of course "
26006,530.1,Chris,,,"yeah it's so cool the scientists they discovered craters full of water on the moon "
26009,530.1,Oliver,,,"yeah well i thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really really small it's actually like a really really really small pieces "
26011,530.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i do because it's it's kind of part of my answer they use the word microscopic and so that's why i said you'd need a microscope to discover the water so you can look at it really closely "
26018,420.2,Luis,,"And I think when we're answering questions such as the one of what equipment that the scientists use. to discover the water on the moon i think that what will make our answer so much better was if we put in some of those details we just talked about ","the scientists "
26020,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah that's the water "
26023,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah so in my answer i said something different i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26027,420.2,Jazmin,,,"because that's where i found my answer it's in part two "
26029,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i guess i wouldn't be that hard i mean i could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter "
26033,420.2,Chris,,,"well yeah i think it does because now it kind of makes me imagine what what it looks like when because when you just said small machine i couldn't really picture it but also i wanted to say i kind of know what what these things might look like because i went to nasa actually i went there and i found out that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26037,310.1,Oliver,,"it allows you to kind of visualize maybe even if i don't know what a lunar orbiter is it helps me kind of imagine some type of machine so thank you for that thank you ","yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because i circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and i don't totally understand why "
26039,310.1,Oliver,,,"like to find it for the first time "
26043,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh um that could be it because um you you find it and then you look at it "
26047,310.1,Oliver,,,"i'm so sorry i don't want to interrupt but i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us really listen to and build on each other's answers on and find the right names for the different pieces of equipment in the text just by listening to each other and talking about it that was really interesting and cool "
26050,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
26054,310.1,Luis,,,"um can i say something that is student over here "
26056,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah before you start um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26059,310.1,Luis,,,"okay that sounds okay okay "
26061,310.1,Luis,,,"okay go ahead student "
26064,310.1,Oliver,,,"student got me all confused "
26067,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah okay i'm so sorry i know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first so i just said i circled all the same thing instead of repeating "
26070,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so i circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26072,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and so i circled small machine my answer is nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26077,310.1,Jazmin,,"i think that you you all circled a really important parts of the text that allow us to understand the different sorts of equipment that nasa uses to find water on space ","oh yeah well i guess i just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering and i don't know the microscope maybe they don't use it to discover "
26081,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay well i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon "
26084,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i don't know about in the text but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26086,310.1,Luis,,,"yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one student "
26089,310.1,Chris,,,"wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water "
26094,310.1,Luis,,,"rocket ships rocket ships "
26098,310.1,Luis,,,"wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon they need landing gear um suits and masks student already said that food really gross food for them to eat on the trip um i think there's a lot of things really a lot of things "
26102,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah if we could take a day trip to the moon i would have done that already "
26106,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth "
26108,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle "
26110,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i'm actually i was gonna say i looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch "
26112,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space "
26114,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah well um i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks "
26116,310.1,Luis,,,"um you mean like in the story "
26120,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah well i said you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely "
26123,310.1,Farrah,,,"Is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it. "
26128,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26130,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yes well i said nasa send a small machine "
26132,310.1,Jazmin,,,"the very beginning of part two "
26135,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
26138,310.1,Farrah,,,"so you're saying you're saying it's the lunar orbiter and not the microscope "
26141,310.1,Chris,,,"oh well i went to nasa so i know that scientists he was a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26148,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay yeah well i suppose the same as something about the microscope but now student read that part about the lunar orbiter and how it investigates so now now i'm really confused i don't know which one it is because they both sound pretty good to me "
26151,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice "
26153,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah yeah it's just water so i guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water "
26156,310.1,Chris,,,"well i i really like what you just said about playing different roles and i think it's i think it's that because it sounds like they sent the lunar orbiter to look for like to discover the the water in the little little ice deposit but then maybe they had to use the microscope to on over to examine it "
26160,310.1,Oliver,,,"that's that's really good answer i agree with student about that but i just i just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch right now but i really wanted to say we really appreciate how you really took your time and sent us back to look at that text and helped us understand the purpose of each of the tools and which one was the best answer for the question thank you so much "
26166,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i alreadyknow all about space "
26169,310.1,Luis,,,"ya sure ok i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26175,420.1,Farrah,,"but actually i'd like us all to take a moment to take a look at the question so just independently by yourself read over the question and maybe circle some keywords or phrases that you think might help us in answering what this question is asking so i'll give you all a minute to do that ","i circled water equipment and moon "
26178,420.1,Farrah,,,"on because it's like one of the first words in the question what equipment did scientists use "
26180,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i circled equipment too "
26182,420.1,Oliver,,,"um i circled equipment too "
26186,420.1,Chris,,,"okay because it's like when it's asking like what equipment the teacher says right after the the question if it says why did blah blah blah what did blah blah blah then the blah blah blah whatever the unitelligle is is the important one Ya so I circled water on the moon oh and also discover. "
26189,420.1,Chris,,,"because that was the action "
26193,420.1,Farrah,,,"I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question. "
26197,420.1,Jazmin,,,"equipment that is on the moon that discovers water "
26202,310.1,Farrah,,"yeah so thank you i like how you phrase that we're looking for equipment that's used to discover water that's great ","we're looking for equipment that they used to discover water on the moon but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26204,310.1,Farrah,,,"ya so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26207,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah well first that's equipment and then i found it in the third paragraph "
26210,310.1,Oliver,,,"i have the same answer so in in the text they said that they use the microscope to look really closely at the water "
26212,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i have a different answer but i think that they they did use it to look closely at the water "
26215,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah okay um let me see i don't remember oh yeah that nasa sent a small machine "
26219,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i was looking for equipment and i know that a machine is equipment and that in that paragraph they were talking about why did i say that oh look for ice deposit so they were looking for i'm looking for ice which is like discovering and looking for i think are kind of the same thing "
26222,310.1,Oliver,,,"i was thinking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen manks oxygen tanks and masks and suits ya student "
26225,420.2,Oliver,,"but just to make sure that we're all on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text but maybe in the future when we're going further you can use all your nasa experience that'd be great ","i'm sorry i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll see you next time okay "
26231,420.2,Luis,,,"i got this all figured out so i'm good "
26233,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so student was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and i think that farrah's right "
26235,420.2,Luis,,,"okay class she said it's equipment i looked at paragraph six and it does talk about water on the moon so it's got all the key things "
26239,420.2,Jazmin,,,"well okay so i do think it's used to look at the water on the moon but i guess i had a different answer so i'm not sure either um "
26241,420.2,Jazmin,,,"okay "
26244,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah well i said nasa had a small machine because that was but that was a paragraph to paragraph three "
26249,420.2,Chris,,,"um it said The lunar orbiter in paragraph two. "
26252,420.2,Oliver,,,"Oh yeah I saw that one. "
26256,420.2,Luis,,,"okay it says that the moon south pole and look for is deposited in a large polar crater so that's what it that's "
26258,420.2,Jazmin,,,"it looks for um i was gonna say the same thing it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um "
26260,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that's the same thing that student said it looks for ice in polar craters "
26265,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay oh what equipment is used to find water i'm still kind of confused "
26269,420.2,Farrah,,,"um Okay, we are it's asking us about equipment that used to discover water on the moon. "
26272,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay yeah i got it so what the teacher saying student it's a microscope was used to look at the water but the lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water "
26276,420.2,Chris,,,"i think so um let me see it it'll look for ice deposits oh yeah it's looking for that okay yeah it's looking for the ice deposits okay you know what i read that there could be a piece on the moon by 2024 "
26278,420.2,Chris,,,"i agree with what student said "
26282,530.1,Oliver,,"before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think ","okay i think i'm ready i'm before our conversation i thought a microscope was thought right answer um and after our conversation i see that it's the lunar orbiter "
26284,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i said before a conversation i said nasa send a small machine but now i see that "
26288,530.1,Jazmin,,,"they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26294,530.1,Farrah,,,"i was gonna before conversation i thought it was a microscope oh cuz it was looking at water but now i know it's a lunar orbiter because it was looking for what "
26299,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools so that was a great revision ","our teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say that i i appreciate how you kept asking us questions you know to like think about the words in the question and on the words in the story so so now i'm thinking about my strategy for thinking if that makes sense "
26303,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26305,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i lot of space and i really want to be an astronaut when i grow up "
26309,310.1,Luis,,,"that's right i would love to share some of my space "
26311,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26313,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so because when they found the water it was really small they have to see it on they have to use the microscope to look at it they can't see it without the microscope "
26315,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah we have them in the science lab we use them in science "
26318,310.1,Jazmin,,,"ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26321,310.1,Jazmin,,,"um okay so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water "
26323,310.1,Jazmin,,,"can i look back "
26325,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay it says nasa send a small machine oh oh it's right here and a lunar orbiter "
26330,310.1,Oliver,,,"um okay so i circled the fame of student about the microscope and i'm a little unclear about why the microscope is that the wrong answer because you said that jazmin's answer was a right answer "
26335,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah we pick that same one "
26337,310.1,Chris,,,"okay well so two things one for my answer i said well that scientists be found creators full of water on the moon and so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26340,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so when part one they say that the scientists found evidence that water can be found in the moon's polar creators so i know that craters are these big score so sort of like holes but above ground and so i'm picturing these critters full of water like lakes of water because craters are so big "
26343,310.1,Chris,,,"oh like pick one of the ones in the story "
26345,310.1,Chris,,,"oh okay um well i think student sounds really good about the lunar orbiter i don't know if i saw that one but i definitely saw other small machines that they launched into space "
26347,310.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah my dad took so many pictures it was actually kind of embarrassing "
26350,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah i am so my answer i said well if kind of like kara since actually cuz i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26352,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah well if there's astronauts up there on the moon i know 100 they have oxygen tanks "
26354,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i said if there's astronauts on the moon i know for sure without a doubt that they have oxygen tanks "
26356,310.1,Luis,,,"oh it's like and anything that space you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks "
26359,310.1,Luis,,,"and um well i'm i gotta admit i didn't really read this but i listened to the conversation and i heard myself and i heard lunar orbiter "
26361,310.1,Luis,,,"i'm now i think i was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on youtube "
26363,310.1,Luis,,,"uh huh okay "
26366,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh that's okay um i just actually needed to say that i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of us i felt like you really gave each one of us attention and helped us understand our answers and the text even better so thank you so much "
26372,310.1,Luis,,,"i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
26375,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay "
26382,310.1,Luis,,,"that's a good plan yeah "
26390,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah okay um so i wrote down that all scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
26392,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the keyword so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon and so that's how i found it in the first paragraph "
26398,310.1,Chris,,"oh i really like that strategy of looking for keywords i think that that can be really helpful i'm i'm actually really happy that you chose to use that strategy ","all okay oh wow oh what scientists used to find water "
26401,310.1,Chris,,,"what tools or equipment was us "
26404,410.2,Chris,,"and one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answer the question ","well i mean i went to nasa so i know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26411,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i you don't understand why my answers wrong "
26415,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i was talking about that i i picked up a microscope because it had all the keywords and not section of all story and i was saying that um they had equipment and this was the only place where they were really talking about equipment and water "
26421,310.1,Oliver,,"okay well i think that it's great that you class have been looking for keywords when i was speaking with student he also he also mentioned the same thing and i think that that's a really great strategy ","oh well we both said equipment um well i said equipment to discover water on the moon umpretty much all of them "
26427,310.1,Oliver,,"and I really value how, in your answer you guys directly talked about a piece of equipment ","yeah yeah yeah we talked about the microscope "
26432,410.2,Oliver,,"and i'm concerned that the responses that you class chose which is a microscope isn't necessarily used to discover water on the moon ","i'm okay i know what discover means um i mean like when you're looking for something and on you will find it on but i also i just saw the clock and i just heard that it's time for us to go "
26434,410.2,Oliver,,,"bye "
26440,410.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26443,410.2,Luis,,,"okay "
26449,410.2,Luis,,,"well they may say yes well i know they use a lot of equipment like in order to go to space they gotta breathe in breathe out oxygen tank so that's like good equipment "
26454,420.3,Luis,,"i agree oxygen tanks are an important piece of equipment for astronauts so i really like that you included that in your response but one thing that i'm concerned about a bit is that i don't remember oxygen tanks being talked about in the passage alright so while i go ahead and talk to my other friends i want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage ","okay okay "
26457,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah i was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph and when i saw machine i know that's like equipment and this one's talking about finding are looking for ice deposit so i figured that was it yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26462,420.2,Jazmin,,"yes well i really value that you talked about a small machine and that you went back into the passage to look for evidence that supports your answer second paragraph does talk about a small machine that nasa used but i want you to think about a little bit about how you can make your answer more detailed and specific alright so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to ","um so you're saying i just gotta find more details and then add them to my answer "
26466,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah sure i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
26470,420.2,Chris,,,"in the first paragraph um yeah it's i took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters great and then i kind of put it in my own words "
26477,310.1,Chris,,"can you look back at the question and tell me what do you think the question is asking you for if you can tell me in maybe just two or three words what is the question asking all right i appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words ","for equipment the scientists use equipment that scientists use for water "
26483,420.2,Chris,,"All right, so equipment and discover now you talked in your response about scientists finding craters on the moon, which is absolutely correct, but I am concerned that your answer doesn't completely align with what the question is asking. so given that we've talked about the two words equipment and discover and we've talked about your answer i want you to see how you can revise your answer to align with what the question is asking ","okay okay so you know as for for well for equipment i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26489,420.2,Oliver,,"response so i want you that can you tell me i know that in your answer you said you circle the same as student but can you put the answer to the question in your own words ","okay sure um so i say the answer is okay well i circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment you need as a microscope to look closely at the water "
26496,420.2,Oliver,,,"well i can share um okay so i was thinking you know um first off we have to find a piece of equipment and so i know when we're in science class the teacher is always like okay we're going to use some science department to base or remember what you have to do and what sometimes we have goggles and sometimes we use the microscope so when i saw that one i was like okay max definitely equipment and then um i was looking for a place on the story where they're talking about scientists using it and on them discovering water and ballpark right before it says the water they found is microscopic and finding is like discovering and so that's how i came up with i don't know if i sing for you student "
26498,420.2,Farrah,,,"um well i guess yeah that's that's similar for me because i was looking for equipment and i saw the microscope and arm and i was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it and i saw that in um in that paragraph three "
26502,310.1,Chris,,"great well i really appreciate how you class chose to look for a piece of equipment ","wasn't a question teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what i wanted to say thank you for asking me those questions about my answer and taking some time to kind of explain how my ideas were connected and how they were connected so now i have some ideas on how to make my answer better "
26505,310.1,Chris,,,"bye teacher "
26509,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26511,310.1,Luis,,,"what "
26513,310.1,Luis,,,"oh oh yes i do okay my favorite thing about space is how pluto it used to be a planet and then then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company "
26517,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon "
26521,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh let me check okay so nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26523,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah well um i said i said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26528,310.1,Luis,,,"i got this one i got this one "
26530,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay microscopic means so so so small "
26534,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah we all use them in science class "
26536,310.1,Chris,,,"well you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it you can see bacteria and cells "
26539,310.1,Chris,,,"also oh can i add one thing "
26541,310.1,Chris,,,"well okay well it's just that i i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like the oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26544,310.1,Luis,,,"that was me that was me i also had that same idea "
26546,310.1,Luis,,,"well without oxygen tanks they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die "
26549,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because i mean i picked the small machine and and i understand also microscope is in there but i don't think i would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am i wrong if i don't say that "
26554,420.2,Oliver,,"Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing. ","well i'm i'm i'm really sorry about this i just looked at the clock i'm actually we are we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for letting us know how important our our knowledge is and the things we know and how there's more than one right answer to this question it was really great to learn that with you today "
26560,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26567,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said nasa sent a small machine "
26571,310.1,Farrah,,"awesome and so what i really like about what you said student is this word machine that you mentioned ","yeah i said microscope was the equipment "
26573,310.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i think the microscope was the equipment they used "
26579,310.1,Luis,,"great student when i read your answer you use the word tool to describe the microscope and so i think that that's another great word when we're thinking of different types of equipment mentioned ","yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe "
26582,310.1,Chris,,,"um so they're looking for water right and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water "
26584,310.1,Jazmin,,,"but i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26588,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah let's take a look at that um i think if you all have your text in front of you it might be a great time to take a look at jazmin's answer and see how we can pull out a specific name of a piece of equipment ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26595,420.2,Chris,,"yeah great and so um I think of work to put all of these pieces together into a full answer. ","to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
26601,510.1,Oliver,,"i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in you'd be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two ","yeah that was in paragraph three "
26603,510.1,Luis,,,"you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26610,510.1,Oliver,,,"looks like it's looking for deposit yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for us to go. "
26612,510.1,Jazmin,,,"bye "
26618,510.1,Luis,,,"teacher okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
26622,510.1,Luis,,,"okay "
26625,510.1,Luis,,,"i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
26628,510.1,Luis,,,"yeah it's in paragraph five "
26631,510.1,Luis,,,"okay well i know that we can breathe oxygen and so they could breathe it oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel yeah so rocket fuel "
26634,510.1,Farrah,,,"yeah well i'm still kind of confused "
26637,510.1,Farrah,,,"well because if luis's right then that will mean that i'm wrong but i think that i think that i i came up with a good answer based on the text too "
26639,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it "
26647,510.1,Chris,,,"own oh yeah okay in paragraph four it says for example was this it could be useful lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of romana spacecraft having water available in the moment me more room on the spacecraft thing "
26653,510.1,Chris,,,"When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
26658,510.1,Oliver,,,"i see that it's almost time for us to go but i am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet but i'm like student said like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon then they could not have to carry the water there by 2024 and then it would be valuable "
26662,510.1,Oliver,,,"well i want to say teacher thank you for when you you asked us all so many questions to try and find out what what we're thinking and i tell you like you know when you were telling me that my idea was still a good idea so thank you for that "
26668,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space "
26672,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so the question is what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon "
26675,420.1,Farrah,,"what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about ","i think an important part of the question is the part about equipment "
26679,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah um i found my answer in paragraph three "
26681,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so paragraph three they were talking about a scientific tool it says that mo story and that's on microscope "
26683,420.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah that says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26685,420.1,Oliver,,,"i thought tiny teeny tiny water "
26689,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i found some way different def i found my answer from paragraph two and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26693,420.1,Chris,,,"well so for my answer i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon but it doesn't new equipment and my answer but that's how i answered the question "
26696,420.1,Jazmin,,,"it says nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26698,420.1,Jazmin,,,"is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
26702,420.1,Oliver,,,"okay so she found a machine was called the lunar orbiter "
26705,420.1,Chris,,,"well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26709,420.1,Farrah,,,"but what about the microscope "
26714,420.1,Farrah,,,"can i read it okay the second sentence mm hmm the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
26717,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh umso like they're both the answer "
26721,420.1,Oliver,,,"um well actually i was just gonna say that i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go and i'll watch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us find that important part of the question because that helps our discussion really help us get to the answer so thank you so much "
26724,420.1,Chris,,,"hi teacher "
26727,420.1,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space i guess so ok class i'll be the reporter "
26738,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay so student do you want to change your answer or student you want to change your answer now i think my answer is great because i i talked about some equipment so i don't even know why i'm in this class i think my answers okay oh let me see yeah i talked about the craters full of water oh so and that's in the story and we were supposed to pull stuff out of the text so oh i think it's fine well i mean i think the mine is right i got my mind was right and we can't all be right because your answer it's very different student and then even we had equipment but you were talking about oxygen tanks and and i'm just talking about the that small machine that they put on the moon okay so uh we have the same answer so i guess i'm not sure why our answer will be wrong cuz it is equipment ya ya it is equipment let me see cuz when i looked in the story yeah we're talking about equipment that's on the moon uh used to find the water and they used a microscope to look at the water so i mean that sounds like the same thing i mean i don't know let me ask the teacher um teacher student and i don't know why our answer is wrong because we think that we we are right "
26740,420.1,Jazmin,,,"good yeah i don't know why my answers wrong too "
26752,420.1,Farrah,,,"oh well okay so when you're like looking for water you know and then you gotta look at it once you find it and what how is looking okay well i guess looking at the water is looking for the water oh uh huh oh yeah okay student i see what you're saying um okay oh so if you're looking at the water you're looking for okay yeah okay nevermind those are two different things i i i didn't think about that "
26754,420.1,Oliver,,"so you can follow that thread to the correct response. ","okay "
26757,420.1,Chris,,,"yeah i had that equipment i said on oxygen tanks in my answer um well okay my question because we were talking about equipment right because student and student had equipment but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26761,420.1,Luis,,"um student um ","um okay it's asking us what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon well i mean like they need oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon so ah why is that wrong "
26768,420.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i guess i didn't really read it before because i felt like i already knew the answer Okay well so me and Luis have different types of equipment, and so I feel like when you were telling them to look it over I looked at over again, and I still feel like my answer is the right one. "
26774,430.2,Jazmin,,"well ","oh okay well let's see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay um yeah i could say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
26778,510.1,Oliver,,"yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions ","oh okay well that's easy i can just add that um yeah teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to lunch um so thanks for everything will see you later okay "
26781,520.1,Luis,,"hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in your responses ","um okay so i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
26783,520.1,Luis,,,"specialist okay okay i guess i could do that "
26786,520.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so i added this specific word to my answer so now is it right the nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter yeah "
26788,520.1,Jazmin,,,"oh wait i have to add that part to this to discover water "
26792,520.1,Jazmin,,,"oh well cuz you told me that at the name of it so i just added the name of it i didn't add anymore after that "
26798,510.1,Jazmin,,"well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses instead of just like adding a name into it ","So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say. to specify i'm doesn't that mean just saying what the name of the equipment is so how come you added okay i guess what i don't understand is how come you added more you added the discover discover water part to the answer "
26803,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay yeah cuz i'm still kind of confused so i guess i'll just ask you after okay "
26808,510.1,Chris,,,"so i know that jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so i guess i'm trying to think about why where i went wrong in mine um because i didn't put any of that stuff in my in my answer "
26813,310.1,Chris,,"um i really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation ","well because it says it in the story it says that um let me see where was that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so um so if something is found deep that means that it has to be like you know like in the pool when you go and you swim in the pool and you go in the deep end and there's like a lot more water on the deep side of the pool then on the shallow side "
26826,310.1,Chris,,,"oh okay yeah i was trying to figure out why student tools out when because i was using the words from the from the question in my answer you know like i was looking for discover and i didn't see discover in the text so then i was thinking okay what's like discover like finding something so then i was looking for to find in the text and i only saw it in two parts in the first part and in the third part on that's where class came from and i knew it wasn't the one that i'm no offense student and student but i knew it wasn't the third part cuz um it was supposed to be like a lot of water in order to find it and that they said you couldn't even see that water so i guess i don't see like discover or find a in the second part where student got her answer so i don't know i don't know how you got that answer student Oh. investigate oh yeah i guess so like like on um on the tv show sometimes they have like a like an investigator who goes to get some information "
26830,310.1,Chris,,,"Oh yeah yeah. okay yeah "
26833,420.2,Oliver,,"but your strategy is absolutely right you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text so i think you're on a good track but if you look at the passage too you can find the word investigate ","um you know what teacher i i had read that there will be a base on the moon by 2024 "
26835,420.2,Oliver,,,"so maybe we'd be able to drink water then by 2024 that's pretty close "
26838,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student "
26842,420.2,Chris,,,"oh oh man yeah maybe i could be when i when i'm old i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to our next class but i wanted to say i'm all thank you for helping us to think about what strategy that we use to get to our answer because um i guess listening to how you were talking to student and and student yeah actually i appreciated that too because i i thought i use the a good strategy but you kind of explained on how i need to think about what some of the words mean and so i think that might give me some ideas on improving my answer "
26847,420.2,Farrah,,,"we'll we'll see you next time teacher bye hi hello can you can you see us or hear us "
26850,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah this is student i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26852,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah i'd love to hear that "
26854,420.2,Farrah,,,"would you like us to to share our responses "
26859,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um yeah i circled the same the same as student "
26861,420.2,Chris,,,"my answer is that i'm okay it's "
26865,420.2,Jazmin,,,"that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i said that nasa sent a small machine "
26867,420.2,Luis,,,"okay my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26874,310.1,Chris,,"you class located the information in the text very very well ","well craters craters are really big "
26878,310.1,Chris,,,"okay "
26882,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
26887,310.1,Farrah,,,"um excuse me this is student i i don't understand why my answers are wrong "
26893,310.1,Farrah,,,"um how can how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope "
26897,310.1,Chris,,,"well hi this is student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26902,430.2,Chris,,"absolutely student um ","huh oh no no they don't talk about that in the story "
26907,430.2,Luis,,,"um yeah but if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks "
26911,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah okay yeah so it's sounding like that aorbiter thing is the answer "
26916,430.2,Oliver,,,"um this is student um i just i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch right now but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time "
26920,430.2,Luis,,,"oh excuse me excuse me "
26925,430.2,Luis,,,"yeah i think i think i think student has something to say though um and and i'll answer maybe after him um yeah okay um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26928,430.2,Luis,,,"yep that sounds great "
26930,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay okay student i guess that's my turn now okay so i found my answer um in part three that's where i found it and it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's where i found it in the text "
26933,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
26937,430.2,Farrah,,,"okay "
26939,430.2,Farrah,,,"what should i do next "
26942,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yes i had a different answer "
26944,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yes and so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26949,430.2,Jazmin,,,"okay yeah so i think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i would say that that's my evidence "
26953,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yes i can okay a lunar orbiter it sounds like so it sounds like it investigates so that means it kind of looks for and locates where is the water on the moon "
26956,430.2,Jazmin,,,"in part two "
26958,430.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah exactly "
26962,420.2,Chris,,"The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for. So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect. Yes, Chris. ","yeah so i wanted to say um i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they actually use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26969,520.1,Chris,,"So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text. ","ok "
26972,520.1,Chris,,,"oh i was just gonna say that makes a lot of sense i understand i need to find equipment in the story right "
26975,520.1,Oliver,,,"um excuse me i'm i'm really sorry i don't want to interrupt but actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us look really specifically in the text and making sure that we had evidence for our answers i know that that's going to be really helpful for questions like this next time "
26978,520.1,Luis,,,"um yeah mr see i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26985,520.1,Farrah,,,"okay so a microscope it's something you look through and when you look through it it makes really tiny things on so you can see that "
26987,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh so they wanted to find the water which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice "
26990,520.1,Chris,,,"oh "
26992,520.1,Jazmin,,,"and so that was actually my answer to nasa send a small machine and i found it in paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26996,520.1,Jazmin,,,"well i'm paragraph to it says it looks for ice in the polar craters "
26999,520.1,Oliver,,,"oh wait so you said why couldn't they see the ice i was gonna say because it was too small that's why they need a microscope "
27002,520.1,Chris,,,"on the crators and i think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there "
27006,520.1,Jazmin,,,"well if the sun was shining maybe the ice would not kind of like kind of like global warming "
27009,520.1,Jazmin,,,"probably not because i think it would melt and then probably a very "
27011,520.1,Farrah,,,"week so it's the right answer the lunar orbiter or it's the right answer microscope "
27014,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh well the microscope "
27016,520.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh i thought you could only have one answer "
27018,520.1,Chris,,,"yeah so um well actually i know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because i went to nasa so i know they use a lot of equipment "
27020,520.1,Chris,,,"oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the lunar orbiter and the microscope "
27025,520.1,Chris,,,"oh i guess it doesn't really talk about astronauts in the story "
27028,520.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah so i think it's a custom lunar orbiter it's actually like a type of a robot and it doesn't even need people to go on it and so there weren't even really people like a string that's on the moon they just like sent the lunar orbiter and it went around and and it found the water "
27030,520.1,Oliver,,,"well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea thank you so much "
27034,520.1,Luis,,,"excuse me "
27037,520.1,Luis,,,"hi yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27039,520.1,Luis,,,"sure do "
27050,520.1,Luis,,,"yep definitely true "
27059,520.1,Farrah,,,"so the reason that i picked the microscope is because it says it there in part three it says the water they found is microscopic so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so it's right there in the story so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27064,520.1,Farrah,,,"a microscope. "
27069,310.1,Jazmin,,"And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope. Ok? Great job. ","yeah so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and that also it's right in the text at the beginning of part two "
27072,310.1,Jazmin,,,"A machine. "
27077,310.1,Chris,,,"ok well so actually i went to nasa so i know that astronauts and scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27079,310.1,Chris,,,"no they aren't in the story "
27082,310.1,Chris,,,"Oh, so the part the circle part because I guess I don't have anything to circle when I talk about the oxygen tanks. "
27089,310.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah well actually it's not really a question but i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you very much for helping us see oh yeah you really helped us see how our answers were part of the way there instead of all of the way there and that really got me thinking about how to use the story to make my answer even better so thank you so much "
27092,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
27094,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh it's great we're really excited to work with you "
27097,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so we read it we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27100,310.1,Luis,,,"oh i watch a lot of videos on youtube and sometimes i read articles like in magazines and i have this book with all these pictures of space oh i really like space "
27105,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so about the equipment i was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
27108,310.1,Luis,,,"on say well sorry yeah so i was thinking if there's scientists on the moon they are going to need oxygen tanks if they're gonna be looking around for a water "
27111,310.1,Farrah,,,"um yes i i thought something different so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27113,310.1,Farrah,,,"so it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope "
27118,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
27120,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so i said that nasa sent a small machine "
27126,310.1,Jazmin,,,"let me check okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh no i think you're frozen i can't see and hear you anymore oh you're back okay thank you so i just said it's called the lunar orbiter i found that in the second paragraph "
27128,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i guess it finds and that i in the craters "
27132,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well okay so i know student talked about the oxygen tanks before and i was thinking something similar of actually because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits "
27136,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm "
27138,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so harris and i know you like when nasa but it doesn't even say anything about oxygen tanks in the story so is that really a right answer "
27147,310.1,Chris,,,"can i guess not so so you're saying that the answer it has to be in the story "
27156,310.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me on i'm so sorry i really don't want to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really listened to everything we had to say but you also reminded us that we really needed to use that text and our answer and that is really really helpful so thank you so much "
27161,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're good we're so excited to work with you "
27163,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27166,310.1,Luis,,,"awesome alright "
27170,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i would say when you hear the word equipment it makes me think of a tool "
27173,310.1,Farrah,,,"i'm like something something you use to do something "
27182,310.1,Oliver,,,"can you "
27184,310.1,Oliver,,"Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way ","oh okay that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it "
27188,310.1,Chris,,,"on me i'm not sure how but i know that they found it in the craters "
27192,310.1,Chris,,,"i guess because we have to talk about equipment right "
27194,310.1,Chris,,,"well because we've been talking about equipment "
27196,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and i was just gonna ask about my response actually so my response was nasa said just small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27199,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i got it right from the text in part two it says nasa send a small machine "
27205,310.1,Luis,,"that's beautiful I love, how you use that context you use evidence from the reading ","um so student it does connect to the context of that question because while she talks about nasa and she found my machine and last door "
27207,310.1,Chris,,,"okay well i was just telling student and of how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27213,310.1,Farrah,,,"well yeah i mean student showed it to us and told us it was in the story but i still don't know why i should pick that and not the microscope "
27215,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay well in part three it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope "
27218,310.1,Farrah,,,"i think it means really really small "
27223,310.1,Oliver,,,"um i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch i wish we could stay i'm really having a rough time um but i wanted to say before we go to lunch thank you so much for reminding us to think about the context of the question that is a really really helpful reminder for this question but also for other questions next time so thank you so much "
27226,310.1,Farrah,,,"hello hi "
27230,310.1,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah that's what i said "
27232,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh i'm not sure i guess on the spaceship probably "
27234,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27236,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the moon and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks "
27242,310.1,Luis,,,"um i saw something that's in the story "
27244,310.1,Luis,,,"oh i probably need to look at that again "
27246,310.1,Luis,,,"okay so they say small machine and they say microscope and those are both the equipment "
27249,310.1,Luis,,,"lunar orbiter yep "
27251,310.1,Luis,,,"um i mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and i know that that means moon "
27253,310.1,Jazmin,,,"so that was my answer my answer was nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27257,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh is that what student was talking about "
27262,310.1,Farrah,,,"um so i'm wondering i the reason i picked a microscope instead of the machine is because how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
27265,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh so i'm the machine it can do the finding even if it can't see it "
27267,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay so um for the answer we just say both "
27271,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah i have a comment so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27273,310.1,Chris,,,"so could we put that in our answer too "
27276,310.1,Chris,,,"oh okay um why "
27282,410.2,Jazmin,,"but our answer has to use evidence from the text sure they might use that other equipment but in the text it didn't have anything about that ","okay okay that makes sense i have a question about the story so the story it doesn't say anything about astronauts going in the lunar orbiter so we're astronauts or do they just do the machine and it does all the work for them "
27284,410.2,Jazmin,,,"so cool machine can do it all without any astronauts "
27286,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah student it's like it's kind of like a robot right "
27288,410.2,Chris,,,"my answer my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon is that ok "
27292,410.1,Oliver,,"so that's what they found but we were looking for what equipment that they used to discover that on the moon ","on i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for helping us today i really appreciate how you helped us use evidence from the text in our answers and reminded us to really use the story and start off just what we knew thank you so much "
27296,410.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i shouldn't be and that's class i already know all about space "
27300,410.1,Luis,,,"okay yeah let me know when you want me to share "
27304,410.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i think was in there okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
27306,410.1,Jazmin,,,"they look for the water on the moon "
27309,410.1,Chris,,,"okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27313,410.1,Chris,,,"i think they said the really dark "
27316,410.1,Chris,,,"ya there's no sun "
27318,410.1,Chris,,,"it's so cool "
27322,410.1,Oliver,,,"oh yeah we both said for the appointment we both said i'm microscope "
27324,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really really small like you can't see them um just in real life you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small "
27326,410.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah because well um because the water it's so small "
27328,410.1,Farrah,,,"um i don't understand why our answer is wrong why is microscope wrong "
27334,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh okay yeah "
27336,410.1,Farrah,,,"i picked it because well i found it in part three in part three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
27339,410.1,Farrah,,,"okay so we're both right both me and student "
27342,410.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah but i mean also student because she said something different "
27344,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i was referring to the lunar orbiter yeah "
27347,410.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah you said they're both right "
27351,410.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay i don't know if i would have known that if you didn't tell me how "
27356,410.1,Jazmin,,,"thank you "
27358,410.1,Chris,,,"yeah well sort of about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27360,410.1,Chris,,,"how they found them "
27363,410.1,Chris,,,"well i mean i'm student just said the machine and student set the microscope "
27366,410.1,Luis,,,"oh um mine was kind of like what student just said i said scientists they use oxygen tanks "
27369,410.1,Luis,,,"i i i don't yeah they didn't say oxygen tanks like in that story but i just know ever there are astronauts on the moon or anywhere in space they need oxygen tanks they definitely need that "
27376,410.1,Luis,,,"ah i am i wasn't really paying attention "
27381,410.1,Oliver,,,"that was easy um yeah i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i really appreciate that you took the time to listen to all of our answers on a really made it feel like you really care what each one of us has to say about the question thank you so much "
27384,410.1,Luis,,,"hi "
27386,410.1,Luis,,,"so i was just gonna say cuz i know that this class is to is to help people who are having some trouble with their answers but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know about space "
27392,410.1,Farrah,,,"yeah so basically what i said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close right "
27394,410.1,Farrah,,,"that's in the craters "
27398,410.1,Farrah,,,"the last glass of water last measure "
27403,410.1,Farrah,,,"so it's not a lot at all two ounces which "
27407,410.1,Farrah,,,"so they're both the answers but "
27411,410.1,Jazmin,,,"i just had a quick question is i think my answer was pretty close to that and i know that again we're working together because our answers right i guess it was a little confused on what my answer was wrong "
27421,420.2,Jazmin,,"and you were right with that you weren't wrong but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail instead of just saying small machine ","explain what the small machine was called yeah so is this small machine is it yes it is good job i have to say the whole thing like i can't just say the small machine "
27423,410.2,Jazmin,,"right you need to be a little more specific so that they understand what you're talking about because i was looking at it and you said small machine and i might think you're talking about the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small ","so you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying "
27428,410.2,Chris,,,"so i i went to nasa with my dad i mean we go a couple times a year to this dentist space center and i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoot i was wondering like i didn't see that in the video and so i thought like isn't that may be an answer for the equipment that they use "
27432,410.2,Oliver,,,"then i wanted to thank you so much for working with us in with you can see thank you "
27436,410.2,Luis,,,"i'm yet so basically i think i finally got this all figured out so good now "
27442,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah absolutely okay so my answer is that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen You remember, if you look Oh well, it's. yeah it's valuable well okay so it's valuable if you look back in the end they have all this stuff about how okay so you can use hydrogen and oxygen you can use let's see in paragraph five they say you can read the oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket so that's really useful because you have rocket fuel that you can make like on the moon you don't have to take it with "
27451,410.2,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so okay here's what i will see so i said no that would not be valuable time yeah i had basically i'm very similar answer but mine was mostly that it wasn't ready yet that you have to do stuff to the water to make it or first you have to find out how to get it like out of the craters and you got to figure out how to know and like all that you can't use it because it's not ready to use yet "
27456,410.2,Chris,,,"my answer was water is heavyy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships which i think would be a really good like the if they didn't they don't need to have any more water they can just get it on the moon "
27460,410.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think you and i guess what i'm wondering is like student mustang like the water is heavy so they don't have they don't have to take it on the spaceship but if they don't have it on the spaceship what will they drink "
27464,410.2,Jazmin,,,"how did they survive like when they're they're flying to the moon so "
27466,410.2,Jazmin,,,"a little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they "
27468,410.2,Jazmin,,,"that makes a lot of sense "
27474,410.2,Oliver,,,"oh actually yeah i was just thinking to myself like well i read that they were going to make up my moon base by maybe on the moon and it made me think that maybe they can use the water to make the moon base possible like they could make oxygen and fuel for the moon "
27485,410.2,Jazmin,,,"we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like one of the things that i really wanted to thank you for working with us is like how you helped us to verify what we were like saying like you helped us understand why did we come up with the answer and you also listen to ideas which really made me feel valued and i think that class had a really good time working with you class yeah i think class really enjoyed it so thank you so much it was really fun working with you thank you "
27487,410.2,Oliver,,,"oh hello "
27492,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27498,410.2,Luis,,,"okay well if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water i know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100 "
27502,410.2,Farrah,,,"okay well we would be looking at the tiny oh what did they call them ice deposits "
27504,410.2,Oliver,,,"okay yeah "
27506,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah we bought picked a microscope for the appointment "
27508,410.2,Oliver,,,"circle on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on and if you see something you can discover it so that's why i picked a microscope because being able to see tiny particles but overall "
27510,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah yeah exactly "
27513,410.2,Jazmin,,,"um i have a different answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27516,410.2,Jazmin,,,"okay it says nasa centers for machine called a lunar orbiter "
27518,430.2,Jazmin,,"I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is. ","oh okay yeah "
27521,430.2,Chris,,,"yeah i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon "
27525,410.3,Chris,,"okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters so just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there that there was water on the moon ","oh okay i guess because we just kind of picture that wrong in my brain "
27528,410.3,Farrah,,,"i'm i'm still kind of confused "
27531,410.3,Farrah,,,"oh well so you said that jazmin's answer was right but what about the microscope "
27538,410.3,Farrah,,,"oh ok so we were both right "
27541,410.3,Chris,,,"oh well i just wanted to share that i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27544,410.3,Chris,,,"so i could put that for my answer "
27546,410.3,Chris,,,"oh so i'm like equipment that was in the story "
27550,410.3,Chris,,,"yeah okay okay so you just want to say one thing from the story and then you could say some stuff you know too "
27555,410.3,Oliver,,,"um so i just looked at the clock and actually um we have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of our answers and helping us understand how they have different machines worked in space that was a really really helpful thank you "
27559,410.3,Oliver,,,"we are excited to work with you "
27562,410.3,Luis,,,"oh yeah i can but i just wanted to say before i read anything that i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like everything there is to know about space "
27564,410.3,Luis,,,"yeah i guess i can i can do that "
27566,410.3,Luis,,,"um okay so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
27573,420.1,Jazmin,,"So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question. Jazmin, you have a question? ","i was just wondering why my answer was wrong "
27578,420.1,Chris,,"what are some keywords or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question what are we looking for in the question ","so we're looking for we're looking for equipment what did they use "
27583,420.1,Farrah,,,"reach every reader oh i just got the same thing to say that also it was easy to find water "
27585,420.1,Luis,,,"um is it like tools you know like it's kind of like a tool that you use "
27588,420.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like i will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment if you are doing those things "
27592,420.1,Oliver,,,"so what we're looking for is we're looking for the the water so that we know that there's water and we're trying to find it "
27596,420.1,Chris,,,"um i guess the only difference that i would add to the answer is i would add that you might be looking more for ice than actual water because it's ice on the "
27602,420.1,Chris,,,"well i was just it was going through my head because we were talking about the different tools and what news define things and i i know cuz i've been to nasa like data few times that you know like astronauts have to wear spacesuits and like they have oxygen tanks and stuff so i was wondering if like well i guess i was wondering are those tools also "
27610,310.1,Farrah,,"there are all different types of tools like equipment gear all those other things but for right now the question is asking for the ones that will help us find the water that was actually good using background knowledge to make connections good job student ","you have to go to our next class but thank you so much it was really interesting to meet you mr t and to talk to you thank you so much "
27631,310.1,Luis,,,"all right okay so let's take a look at their craft and see if there's anything that are like clues that we can use okay so um alright so let's read it together okay nasa send a small machine called lunar orbiter just a very small so what do you think student is there anything in there that you think could be that cool um yeah i think there's a couple options actually up i think one of the options could be because i can see some questions because i can see that one machine is the lunar orbiter but like it's possible that that's the answer but you could also say that the cup that they used to measure the water that's the answer too oh i didn't think about that so it could be the lunar orbiter or it could be the cup or maybe both like maybe they use both of those kinds of equipment you know what i mean yeah that's possible okay class so let's talk about what we what we saw okay so when we were reading the character and looking at this stuff like i guess what i like to be with the stuff about like is what jumped out to me was the lunar orbiter like that's what i thought what you see what i'm still a bit confused about why my answer was wrong because i always thought that it was the lunar orbiter do you class agree he basically well i kind of agree i could see that it's an orbiter but i also think that there's other equipment that is be left out of the meeting i think that they use like you know i know that they have to use this other stuff even if it's not like satellites at radar and all that stuff to find like were even on the phone to look so i think that's confusing right way like i feel the same way cuz i'm thinking to myself like probably they use other stuff as well i'm not really sure "
27634,310.1,Luis,,,"yes i got it all figured out good i think i'm ready to go back to my desk "
27641,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so the first time that we were getting answers i thought the answer was the lunar orbiter and i still think that's the answer because that's the small machine that that the scientists set and they're the ones that it says in the reading there the one it says they investigate with the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer because that tells me that they were finding finding something stuff so that tells me that they found all about the ice "
27647,310.1,Jazmin,,,"one nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that i was like why my answer wasn't wasn't right to begin with you know i said it was a small machine like i guess i just wanted like what was missing from my answer "
27650,310.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah that makes sense "
27654,310.1,Chris,,,"so i thought when we were discussing up like i think student as a really good theory and i i could see how it could be the lunar orbiter i can i can see that now since she explained it but i still think that the question is saying like you know like what equipment could it be and it saying like it could be even more than one piece so student and i thought that the fact that they don't mention like satellite radar and even the oxygen tanks and stuff like i think we're still the class that that would be something that they have forgetting to say "
27659,310.1,Chris,,,"okay gotcha "
27665,310.1,Farrah,,,"so i'm student do you want to talk first so we kind of had a slightly different answer after focusing on the second paragraph we guess that probably you wanted us to see that the lunar orbiter was one of the things but even then we were still thinking that maybe it was the glass of water that they measured the 32 ounces with because that's equivalent to so we thought maybe we keep seeing lots of different like it seems like for other folks that they're able to see that there's other like they're able to guess like what kind of us we keep seeing like different pieces like the microscope and the glass and the lunar orbiter and we keep thinking they're using all right yeah i keep thinking that they're probably using all those states to do the measurements "
27671,310.1,Oliver,,,"a couple of men are at right "
27673,310.1,Oliver,,,"so you class "
27680,310.1,Farrah,,,"well i just wanted to say actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to just say how much we enjoyed working with you and like in particular you really helped us to clarify our thinking about what we were trying to you know think about in our answers and try to like you know find the best answer that could and you also help this use evidence from the text so we knew that we needed to really prove our weight and i realized that most of us really except for except for student we didn't really prove our point because we weren't i guess we brought the microscope in but it wasn't the right answer so you helped us find both like what was the answer that we were looking for and also how to how to prove it so that was pretty cool thank you so much "
27683,310.1,Farrah,,,"hello hi how are you "
27685,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you that's great that's great "
27688,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah yeah um so um i shouldn't be and that's already know a lot about that space "
27692,310.1,Luis,,,"sure yeah i'd love to do that "
27695,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay the question is what equipment at scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
27698,310.1,Chris,,,"okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27704,310.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay. i said nasa sent a small machine "
27707,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well it's kind of wondering that because i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27710,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay how about you it's not so simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quite a few years these ice are very small "
27713,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well it sounds like the small machine "
27716,310.1,Jazmin,,,"okay a small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits "
27718,310.1,Jazmin,,,"and so i just had to say lunar orbiter "
27722,310.1,Farrah,,,"um well i i had a different answer i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so um well you just said student is right but what about the microscope "
27726,310.1,Farrah,,,"But I guess I don't understand why. "
27729,310.1,Farrah,,,"why why it's not the microscope oh "
27736,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh no you're doing really well i just just i just wanted to know why it's the lunar orbiter it's okay it's okay if you want to talk to someone else that's okay i can work on "
27739,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well actually it's a comment on yes i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27744,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch student that was kind of like my answer to for the question and my answer was that scientists use oxygen tanks so i was just that connection i just wanted to make that connection that to discover the water on the moon they use oxygen tanks "
27747,310.1,Oliver,,,"um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for being so patient with us and giving all of us the chance to share it was really nice to work with you today thank you "
27756,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class because i know all this stuff "
27759,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i was thinking when i was reading when i was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when i watched like space shows on tv they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that so it seems weird that they left that out "
27763,420.3,Luis,,"i see how you're answering this question by using your own knowledge rate your own experiences from watching movies and seeing the equipment that's being used and i'm concerned though that the question is asking specifically for how the water was found so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay ","like just for the water "
27768,420.3,Farrah,,"so take a look at paragraph two and see if you can find that tool ","yeah i i was just wondering i was confused about like why my answer was wrong "
27776,420.3,Farrah,,"i'm concerned that the question is asking for what was used to discover water right and we've only mentioned the tool that's used to see it once you have discovered it. so my suggestion for both of you is that you reread paragraph two and maybe some of three and really understand what tool is being used to find the water before they use the microscope ","um i think it makes sense but i think that what's confusing to me is that like how could they find the water if they can't see the water like you know what i mean like they said that the water was like what did they say like microscopic so that means like really small right so like how did they find it if they couldn't see it "
27779,420.3,Farrah,,"so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works ","okay i'll check it out "
27783,420.3,Chris,,,"um ya so my question is that like ok so like student said that which i think was good was that like the scientists use lots of equipment and i've been to nasa so i know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so i guess i was like isn't that the answer for like how they found the water "
27792,410.2,Jazmin,,"my suggestion again is that we take a look at this paragraph two because there is another tool that was used in order to find the water even before they could see it but you didn't specify exactly what that machine was called ","yes my idea was that it was this small machine and i was wondering i wasn't sure like what my answer was wrong because it seems like this small machine was probably the thing that they used to find the water "
27794,410.2,Jazmin,,,"oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter is that the answer "
27799,410.2,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but this was really exciting thank you so much "
27801,410.2,Reach Every Reader,,,"hi "
27806,410.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i i was just gonna say i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm good "
27814,420.3,Farrah,,"i'm concerned though that there is evidence in paragraph four my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful ","yeah we can do that "
27826,420.3,Chris,,"my suggestion is similar to student and student take a look at paragraph four and to see why it would be helpful to have it on the moon there student you also spoke about paragraph five so why don't you read both paragraphs to see if you can find why it wouldn't be helpful to have it in a spaceship student and student reread paragraph four to find out why water would be better on the moon ","well cuz i was thinking you don't even need to take it anymore cuz if it's on the moon you don't even need to bring it with you "
27830,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yes i was just going to say i'm still kind of confused "
27834,420.2,Jazmin,,"so maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it ","oh that makes a lot of sense okay let me change my answer "
27839,420.3,Luis,,"great student you've included some great past knowledge about how water is composed of these two parts hydrogen and oxygen it's a great time to chemistry that makes sense with why we need water we need these perks i am concerned though that the question is asking why you would want water on the moon right and we haven't mentioned the moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon ","yeah so like you're saying like i should have some reason like like okay yeah like the water does this they can do that like why is it is that right "
27842,420.2,Luis,,"exactly similar to student you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon ","i can do that "
27845,420.2,Oliver,,,"yeah so i read that there was going to be a base on the moon by 2024 "
27847,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh that's a good question um i read it online "
27851,410.1,Oliver,,"so my suggestion is that you make sure to mention in addition to the base being built how it would be really helpful to have water there i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water ","okay "
27859,410.1,Farrah,,,"on okay so i thought about some of the ways that it could be valuable and at still like okay so i think i might still make the argument that it might not be valuable yet but maybe it will be valuable once we have the like i think the word is infrastructure infrastructure and you like once we have that like the equipment and stuff on the we could use it a lot i still think it's probably in the future but i did look at what you said in the paragraph and i could see that there was stuff that would be really valuable like you can use it to drink you can make rocket fuel from it like there's a lot of stuff where certainly eventually it would be really valuable "
27868,410.1,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to say that you really helped us and like i think what was really interesting and really cool was how you explain like what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas for like not like what the answer was but like how we could make our answers better i'd like more complete like you agree class like i think that was really fun so thank you so much because that was really cool bye "
27872,410.1,Oliver,,,"um we're good just excited to work with you "
27875,410.1,Luis,,,"um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
27882,410.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i circled the same thing as student "
27884,410.1,Oliver,,,"yeah so okay so survey and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i think that that class because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that i circled and i saw that the equipment that i noticed was the microscope "
27890,310.1,Farrah,,"okay so i see that what you did is when you were looking at the article you identified words that remind you of equipment right and one piece of equipment is a microscope ","yeah i had the same answer "
27895,420.3,Farrah,,"So there's more than one piece of equipment, I might look and see like which ones are most important and rank and sort to identify the most important pieces of equipment that the scientists use. ","yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment i think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong "
27898,420.2,Farrah,,"i didn't say that your answer was wrong i think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article but i wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence ","that makes sense okay i'm gonna try that "
27903,420.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah so basically what i said is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27909,420.2,Chris,,,"ya so it says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so that makes me think that they're probably full off water "
27918,410.2,Chris,,"One of the, a concern that I have is When you're reading nonfiction often they'll give you a little bit of information in the beginning, and then they'll keep elaborating on it later in the article that will give you a fuller picture of what they're talking about. so i'm concerned student that you took your answer only from the first paragraph but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article ","because i i went to so with like that so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits at that's not in the reading that i saw so i understand like maybe the reading doesn't have everything but also maybe i need to read a little more closely "
27922,410.2,Chris,,,"that's a really good point "
27924,420.2,Chris,,"so why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread ","okay "
27929,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah thank you so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just want to say that i know that our time was really short but i really appreciate it how you have to clarify what we were so that we could address like what to our answers because you really thought about like what you were concerned about and even a question about how we could work on what we were and that was really helpful and i know that student knew and student knew exactly what to do to try to improve our answers so thank you so much it was really fun bye "
27929,420.2,Farrah,,," "
27929,550.1,Farrah,,"how has student thinking changed i want you to write in student reflection journal how has student thinking changed from when we started this activity can somebody tell me and i want to see student hands raised what does it mean to find evidence when we're talking about evidence we're thinking about what words do i see in this text or reading that help me answer this question we might look for cue words or leading words like called like you notice how called is before that so that's a great example of a word that we might that we might use alright student can you explain to me what evidence is but when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us you want to look in the story for where you can find these answers alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation yes so the next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what student looking for yes student exactly student so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning so how can we approach that question a little differently now that student looked at it when you read something it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question and then you go look at student question and you look at what it's really asking you and then student read it again right so it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question does that make sense when we read the text and we read the question we need to correlate or we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking you the strategy i talked about if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over thank you okay so student do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking can you go back to that what i want to challenge you with is the next time that you are posed with a question i want you to first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword keyword to help us and to answer the question always find and identify a keyword so you really understand what student looking for and go back in the text she used the passage that we provided to find her answer she didn't just use her background knowledge she made sure to go back and find something in the text and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change i think what we all need to take away is that when we're answering reading comprehension questions we really need to focus on going back and reading the article in detail and maybe highlighting the text or annotating the text so that we can really understand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it make sure when student reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to student question so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called sometimes we can read things but not quite absorb everything so it's always a good idea to go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you now one of the strategies that we were going to use today is to look at some keywords that we have in our question okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming for restating a question you listen carefully for the words being used such as in our question to answer the question using the race method you restate the question how can you use student knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson okay so who can tell me what they did to correct their answer so how did you go about correcting student answer we look really closely at those keywords in our question so remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text so remember when we are looking at our question we always have to look for those important words and then we have to look in our text for the same words so that we can try to find our answer often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story well what i do agree what can you we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student i think we've all kind of learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywords text but what we need to do is definitely go through student passage and then highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question you built off student answer i appreciate how you build student answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing okay again so and much like with student earlier we're just we're trying to look at that question and we're specifically boiling it down to just its core components that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer so i really like to do is the race format so we're going to restate the question we're going to answer the question we're going to cite evidence and then we're going to explain that evidence so for example when i read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon i try to think to myself i try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment but i think next time we need to use the strategy of looking at keywords and be really specific so next time you have a question you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer see sometimes it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer so now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time to when student looking back in the text so now that we have talked about this how has this changed student think alright so next time go back and look in the story to find student answer yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for all not just student so when student answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading how did student thinking change there what did you do differently great job that's a good strategy finding those key clues and keywords to help you find student answer so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make student answer better ok so now that i have given you all some feedback i want you to think about how you started out thinking then how that changed and how you will apply what you learned in student next task so i'm gonna give you all a couple minutes to think about it and then we will go around in the circle answering so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question we're just going to go around student what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water great so i really liked that response because you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response so can you tell me how student answer changed from the beginning so what would you with our discussion today what would you say student answer would be and how would it change so next time you answer a question like that what i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using definitely use student imagination i really like how you visualize the situation before giving student answer that's a really good strategy to answering questions student has that change student thinking a little bit right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use student background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use student background knowledge right so what are a few things we can do next time when student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information yes that was a perfect response you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response good job so to find evidence we need to use those quotes from the text and i like that student quoted and she said paragraph three so we could all look at our texts and find where she was reading do you see any ways that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that student hearing from student other friends and student i like that student connecting student background knowledge to help you it's great that student using student notes to help you further understand this text that's an excellent strategy that good readers use then you provided reasoning which is you can't survive without water it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this i'm hearing that you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking and i'm hearing that you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer in the future i think it might be great if you write down this process in a notebook student connecting the details to another part of the text to explain how it could be valuable student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace so when we're answering comprehension questions like this we really need to dig into the text and make sure we're using all the information that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text i am going to give you some sentence starters and this is going to help us really solidify our learning and reading strategies alright so for example i can start out saying i started out thinking and you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so next time you see a question asking about a text i will do what so you think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use when you are reading a text and answering a question yo yo you started out thinking a certain way and now you think so why did you change student answer to what student also wrote what were you thinking okay so next time that you see a question like this that's asking about a text what are you going to do she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon so we're gonna take a minute to turn around to student partner next to you and student going to talk about what are student takeaway from the revision process and so the next time i see a question like this where i have to look at the text again i'm going to talk about a strategy can you do you remember can you restate what their strategy is does class else want to share maybe they're thinking on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed does class else want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading so this is a really good thing that you were just able to do so when you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it that's an excellent strategy to be looking at the text and pulling out those keywords and i think that that's an excellent strategy for all to think about when we're reading a text is to think next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay specific name and of the things that you described okay when student trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already so that's great that's a great segue so what i wanted to ask you all next because you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process or even thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts like these okay um so when student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex in reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add and what about that and when you all are thinking about that what parts can we use in the future when we're reading a question like this do you think that there's any of the words that we understand better now or anything about this about space that we under or about the moon that we understand better now or water it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this okay so what was different about that answer versus student first responsedis what do you think will stick with you for the next time student answering a similar question student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it i mean student 100 right and using that background knowledge but when we answer questions especially questions about a text we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text mm hmm so let's just think about as a all like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay and moon so i want to make sure that my answers to those questions incorporate all of those components ok so student do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking what i'm going to suggest to all of you is when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question so i guess the other strategy that student going to want to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this that can help you make some inferences you want to read a little bit more closely for the meaning of the the material before it yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers great so student now that student participating already would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response okay so looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a great strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely is there anything else did class do anything different when they were revising their answerdis so we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so first student going to answer i started out thinking blank then student going to answer and now i think blank because blank go ahead and take 30 seconds to answer those questions so next time you see a question asking about a text what will you do what made you change student thinking on that i love that you are looking for keywords that's a really strong reading technique and then after student finished i'm curious if you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times what was different about student first answer and student second you saiddis i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a more full response okay what could you do next time you get a question like this what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking i think that's totally a great strategy for you i think if you see the question provide student answer just look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go so how can i ask you a question how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change how can you know to look or how can you how can you see what the question is asking so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down fantastic so i really appreciate something student just did he took little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here the question when we're looking for an answer it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think i think it's nice though when we read a text if we can scan the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two has our thinking kind of changed at all since we started talking through this student sorry i saw student hand was up yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying student responses instead of just like adding into adding a name into it so but student strategy is absolutely right you you locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text so the next time when student answering these kinds of questions be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text tell me how your thinking has changed what does it means to find evidencequestion what i mean about evidence is we're thinking about what words do i see what help me answer this question lookimg for cue words or leading words is a great example of a word that we might that we might use can you explain to me what evidence is question when looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help look in the story to find these answers how has they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation next time student reading a tough question it can help you to look for that action words to know specifically so how's student thinking changed since the very beginning let's approach that question adifferently now student looked question it's a three step process when student trying to answer a question look at student question what is it really asking studentquestion it is three steps skim read fast and look at the questionthen you read to find the answer to that question we read the question we need to correlate we need to put them together to see what they're actually asking this is the strategy i mean to be good at something keep doing it over and over and over do you feel like student changed student student process for working through text and questions about keyword discovery were you were thinking about how that was changing student thinking next timeyou are posed with a question first think about student question and then dig into the passage and really circle and find the evidence we looked at the question and found a keyword keywords help us to answer questions find and identify a keyword to understand what student looking for use the passage provided to find answer dont use her background knowledge make sure to go back and find something in text how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiterquestion what did you do to make that change when answering reading comprehension questions we focus on going back and reading the article in detail and highlight or annotate the text or annotating the text so we canunderstand in detail what we're learning and why we're learning it when student reading the passage highlight important facts i like how you went back and reread student text to figure out what that machine was actually called we can read things but not quite absorb everything go back and reread student text underline important information and details that can help you answer questions about it afterwards and keep that knowledge with you one of the strategies we use is to look at some keywords that we have in our question okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important informationevidence how can this broaden student understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether listen carefully for the words being used to restate question you answer the question using the same method you restated the question use student knowledge of restating the question in next lesson how did studentgo about correcting student answer examine the keywords in question when reading question look really closely at keywords we always have to look for those important words we can find our answer by lookin in our text for the same words it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story we don't want to just say we agree and it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on so yeah you were partially right you want to look for that name student we've learned a lesson when we're reading the information we have to pay attention to it and not just assume weknow different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being givendis we need to make sure when we're answering the question we're answering questions like this looked for those keywords when we looked very closely at texttext go through passage and highlight important details you always want to highlight student headings or student sub headings because those are key details that could give you some good evidence that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with student question and could possibly support student answer a chronological timeline of events in a text break down the text and circled hat happened first and what happened next you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question you built off student answer got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for ook at that question and specifically boil it down to its core components that that is a um sometimes it takes a little bit of work to get everything together and it's called summarizing so we want to be able to put together the words and come up with the best answer swe're going to restate the question to answer the question we cite evidence and then explain that evidence try to restate the question into an answer and then fill in the blank spots that the questions asking leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment use the strategy of looking at keywords and be specific you can underline student keywords to help you be more specific it's very important to highlight those keywords to get the best answer it's okay to go back and reread to find the answer now that student figured out the full answer what will you do next time when looking at the text now has this changed student thinking now that we have talked about this next time go back and look in the story to find answer when student answering these questions use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading what did student do differently and how did student thinking change there that's a good strategy finding those clues and keywords how do you think you can make student answer better next time you are answering a question like this i want you to think about how student started out thinking then how that changed how you will apply what you learned in student next task i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question what do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer student question so after you use student background knowledge what do you think what strategy do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question what do you think first student going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for student next assignment or task and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water you explained studentself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for tell me how has student answer changed from the beginning what would you say student answer would be and how would it change next time i want to hear is the actual equipment they were using imagination is a really good strategy to answering questions visualization is a really good strategy to answering questions changed student thinking a little bit next time you get a question on a text don't use student background knowledge next time when if student not quite sure if student answers are all the way there yet you used direct language from the text used specific vocab and you provided reasoning it was very specific that was a perfect response we need to use those quotes from the textt o find evidence do you see that student mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently that's an excellent strategy that good readers use student provided reasoning it's very important to backup student answers with reasoning next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this you read the text for details and evidence to help support student thinking you have an idea of how you can repeat this answer it would be great if you write down this process in a notebook it could be valuable to connect the details to another part of the text to explain how student you are using student background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply student answerspace when answering comprehension questions we need to dig into the text and make sure we're using the information when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use student's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text here are some sentence starters to help us solidify our learning and reading strategies you would say student prior response and now i think this way because and then you can tell me so next time you see a question asking about a text i will do what when you are reading a text and answering a question think about the thinking and thinking strategy that you use student started out thinking a certain way and now you think why did you change student answer to what student also wrote next time that you see a question like this what are you going to do go back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used what are student takeaway from the revision process next time student see a question like this where have to look at the text again talk about a strategy can you restate what their strategy is does class want to share their on what they thought that was the right answer but now what they know is the right answer does class want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed does class want to share their thinking about what they had for their first answer and how it could have changed after rereading you were rereading student able to see where you found student answer and you were able to find another part that you could add to it pulling out those keywords is an excellent strategy that's an excellent strategy for class to think about be as specific as you can to answer the questionnext time you see this kind of question locate these keywords in the paragraph make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text we're need to use information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already you just gave specific evidence of what the question said and you analyze that and picked an answer based off that specifically so that's a great process thinking beyond today some tools that we can use for future texts student thinking about student original answer and student new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers in the future i think that what you said about details is very important what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer reviewing them a couple times is important student you have something to add think about that what parts to use in the future are there any words that we understand better now or anything about this about that we understand better now look back at the passage and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question awesome so how would that how would you need to revise student answer to include those two ideas when student get a question like this what student would do next time what was different about that answer versus student first response next time student answering samewhatwill stick with you student what about you how did student answer change when you were able to revise it we always want to make sure that our answers on have evidence that are found directly from the text what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student so as we proceed with this discussion i would want you to observe how student thinking changes as we move along the discussion is okay make sure that student answers to those questions incorporate all of those components do you want to share student new thinking what has changed in student thinking when you start the first thing you do before you start reading is to actually look closely at the question anither strategy to use is to is to think about the question that they're asking and then student trying to make some connections between the concepts that student reading how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making

closely for the meaning of the the material before it we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers would you mind telling me what student thinking was when you went back to try to revise student response looking for evidence in the text and circling that evidence is a good strategy to make sure that we're answering the question completely would student do anything different to were revise answer we're going to be thinking about what strategies we use to revise our answers and how we can use those strategies the next time we come across a question like this so what will student do when you see a question asking about a text next time what made you change student thinking on that looking for keywords is a strong reading technique could you could share about how student thinking has changed from student original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times tell me what was different about student first answer and studentdis you also added some specificity to student answer do you think that helped you get a key full response if you get a question like this what could you do next time what mightstudent do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking that's totally a great strategy for student look over student answer one more time and then make sure it answers matches the question and you'll be good to go how did you get from student first answer to student second answer how did student thinking change how can you how can you see what the question is asking so that you understand what answer to give other than just putting more words down studenttook little parts of the world to lunar orbit to draw a conclusion from that so we're really looking for small details here it's important to think about those keywords and it can also be helpful to create our sentence but i wouldn't say that it necessarily has to be in student response before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think we can read the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text we can read the text for specific pieces of equipment then that way when we write our answers out if i ever asked you can you tell me what paragraph you found that in student be able to point to that exact part of the text so i think student you did just that when you just re read that beginning of paragraph two has our thinking kind of changed at all since we started talking through this student sorry i saw student hand was up that's a strategy you can use in response questions hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in student responses this strategy is correct to locate the keywords in the question and you find them in the text next time be sure to look for student information or student answer in the text "," "

tell you used your own knowledge with that bsolutely right an ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet you did mention a specific piece of equipment and it may not be the best answer and you still address the equipment part of the question i appreciate you being really specific in student answer she did a good job and you were very specific about it excellent thank you i see your line of thought i really appreciate that student telling us that they sent a small machine it was a right answer that was one of our right answers i appreciate that you did a great job using student

might take a lot of time and money i appreciate that your opinion that you don't think that it's it's going to be convincing or or it's going to be valuable i see what his thinking was when he said

name of that machine very good and nice job looking back at the text you remembered from your text and you elaborated by restating the question it does say the water is microscopic and you would need to see a microscope you would use a microscope to see it if you went to nasa and you actually that i can understand why you would think that okay i understand why you would say that i see where you got your answer i like your thinking that is awesome you used details from the text so great job using evidence from the text good thinking because we are talking about water we but there are a few

job at using student past knowledge about microscopes you redirected and rethought your answers you looked back at the text yes that was within the document that you can split water into oxygen and hydrogen that is very good that you were able to find that key evidence fast good job looking deep into your question and circling keywords i was very impressed about yous took time to look over and

specifically referenced in the text i do like how you have referenced something in the text that is specific that water can be broken down into oxygen and hydrogen that is great because you obviously went to the text and the text does in fact say that astronauts could drink the water i do love that you brought your prior knowledge into the conversation you said that scientists use a microscope to look closely and i wanted to say that that was really good i liked that you used the specific name of the tool that the scientists used it's really good when you'ret reading a text to think about what

great academic vocab words you noticed that it was a small machine which was very good it's grreat that that you used student context from the text it's always good to have background knowledge to help us understand our text better you had said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen you are right that is from the passage so you did get that from the passage which is good that was great to use the reading to help your with your answer that was awesome i see what you did that's what it says in the text which is awesome that you used our resource i see where student coming from because it does say right here that making a plan will take a lot more time and money i agree to the microscope is very important with discovering water on the moon yeah thank you for
