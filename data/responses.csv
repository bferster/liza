3,,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
5,,Farrah,,,"great we're so excited for your class "
9,140.1,Farrah,,"if you class can come up with a name that you want me to call you in the collective so i don't like to say boys and girls and i don't like to say you class so do is it a school mascot do you want to be the jet eyes the eagles the ketchup packets what can i call you as a class ","okay how about how about the wildcats because that's our that's our school class "
11,140.1,Luis,,,"yeah i'm okay i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17,150.1,Farrah,,"so we all as wild cats were talking about water on the moon right ","yeah okay um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26,110.1,Farrah,,"we're going to wait because i'm i'm talking to student and deb because this is specific to the question that they that they asked is that ok ok i put a pin you i'll come back to you ","as well okay you said what do they use before the microscope and i guess i guess i don't really know i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
31,130.2,Jazmin,,"awesome awesome okay student and student will pair up and and find the answer to that question thank you folks ","okay well okay i said nasa sent a small machine "
36,110.4,Jazmin,,"that's right you totally did and nasa did send a small machine ","i have to look so yeah "
41,210.3,Farrah,,"student and student are you ready to come back to us with an answer or do you want me to to investigate some other answers first ","okay well um so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell student that lunar orbiter is the right answer and so i guess i guess i know that now but i don't know um how i how i would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense "
45,210.2,Farrah,,"It says NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and so that is the question of what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, not to look at it afterwards, does that make sense. ","oh yeah okay okay so first they find it with the orbiter and then then also it's like they then they like study it they study it with a microscope "
48,130.2,Oliver,,"you got it student are you are you on board with that ","um yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense it's like they use one then they use the other "
51,130.2,Chris,,,"oh well it's kind of a comment "
53,130.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
57,120.4,Chris,,"so let's see student what answer did you put for the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh man oh i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for coming in and bringing so much energy and helping us learn in such a fun way i didn't know that this was going to be so fun looking at this article and i just wanted to say thank you for listening and explaining but also making it fun "
62,220.1,Luis,,"i think these are all really great starting answers and i just want us to really work on looking at this text a little more so that we can make our answers more complete and built on textual evidence that we see in the reading and so ","yeah um so i i should it be and this class i already know all about space "
66,150.1,Luis,,"does that sound okay ","yeah okay i'll i'll stick around "
71,230.2,Farrah,,"like where where they found their answer in the texts yes student ","ok so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so i found it in part three and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope "
78,130.2,Oliver,,"this microscope would allow us to discover water so then we got the first part of the question right the equipment and now can we get someone to think about how that connects to the discovering waterpark yes student ","um yeah i can do that because i had the same answer student about the microscope and so in terms of discovering the water the water so small that you can't discover something you can't see so i would need a microscope to see it to discover it "
83,230.3,Jazmin,,"Even better answer So yes, great so you have this microscope and we're saying that we need it because to discover the water, because the water is so small that you wouldn't be able to see it otherwise awesome yes Jazmin. ","so i have a different answer on my necessary such a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
88,230.1,Jazmin,,"i'm glad you brought this up because i was just about to ask what other answers people had so why don't you share a little bit about what you were thinking with your answer ","okay so i found that in part two and it's in the very first sentence it says nasa center small machine "
91,210.4,Jazmin,,"what is the machine called ","a lunar orbiter "
94,130.2,Luis,,"awesome a lunar orbiter now let's have someone else add to that answer so how did that allow scientists to discover water on the moon ","okay so the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like a robot thing and it can go into the craters the dark the dark moon graders and that's how it can find that that tiny tiny water "
97,210.4,Luis,,"so we have this lunar orbiter and it's going into this polar crater and it's looking for the small water and where's the small water located ","and greater "
99,210.4,Luis,,"we're looking for a giant lake so we're looking for what can we yeah well for me, what form is the water in what is the same, the text in part two, yes don't. ","fit as a water as ice "
101,110.1,Chris,,"yes ice and ice deposits yes student ","okay well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
112,150.1,Farrah,,"let me just stop pause for a minute and see if you class have questions yeah student ","okay well so my question is is it okay if i just say the microscope or do i have to less like all of the equipment like the microscope and the orbiter and the oxygen tanks and masks and things "
115,420.2,Oliver,,"and then explain how that equipment was used to discover water on the moon and then once you've gotten that you can add that to your answer ","i'm i'm so sorry i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for encouraging us to build on our answers but also build on each other's answers on and make them way better that was so helpful thank you so much "
119,120.3,Farrah,,"and student would you mind reading for us again the question that we're going to be answering together ","okay it's what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon "
121,120.3,Luis,,"excellent and student could you read what is the second part of that what are we circling ","excuse me i have my hand up "
123,120.3,Luis,,,"well i just wanted to say before we go too far i shouldn't be in class i already know all about space "
125,110.3,Luis,,"oh good well that means that you can help us i think that your background knowledge is going to be very helpful for us in this class student ","reacher every reader possible "
130,120.3,Chris,,"and that's deb that's what i was going to ask you to read is that second part of the question there you see where it says circle ","yeah i can do up um it says circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question "
136,120.3,Chris,,"so to keep going around student if you wouldn't mind reading the first paragraph there where it says one ","yeah okay um part one scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the rooms polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
140,120.3,Jazmin,,"excellent student could you read the second paragraph for us ","yeah i would like to because this is where i found my answer it says okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these isotope posits are very small and so my answer was from this park it's a nasa scientist small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
142,420.2,Jazmin,,"how can we work in the text can we find something that's going to give you even more specific information about that small machine ","oh well in the part i just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits "
149,230.3,Farrah,,"so okay we might have found our answer in the second paragraph we're thinking that perhaps the equipment that they used is this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","and so i found my answer and part three i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and that's evidence from the text also "
152,120.3,Luis,,"student just to get your voice in here let's take a look at that last paragraph real quick would you mind reading number three for us ","yeah you got it okay that means that the moon estelle drier than the driest desert on earth water they found as a microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
154,120.2,Chris,,"thank you so much okay so the question is asking us what equipment and scientists use yes student ","well since we're talking about equipment i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
160,120.2,Farrah,,"so what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ","oh well i guess if something is so small that you can't even see it how can you discover it don't you need to see it "
163,230.3,Farrah,,"yeah so you're you're you're thinking they might have needed to use a microscope to see it ","it says you need a scientific tool "
167,410.3,Oliver,,"i think you're raising a good point that they might have needed to use something like a microscope but we don't know for sure because it doesn't say that the scientists definitely used a microscope ","oh yeah i just want to lock on and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go back into the text and look for evidence and look really closely at all of the words even just where it said you'd need even that was important and so thank you so much for helping us learn that today "
174,120.2,Luis,,"so today we are going to dig more into our question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon so thank you all for sharing your answers ","i'm excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about speed "
176,150.1,Luis,,"yeah so student we're learning about space a little bit but we're also practicing our good science thinking skills so we can all learn more about our science thinking skills student ","okay "
178,230.1,Luis,,"student why don't you tell me more about your answer what made you say what you said ","that scientists use oxygen tanks while cuz i know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space "
187,420.3,Luis,,"i am wondering if you can pull out some information from the text that we used so can you find a specific piece of equipment mentioned in this text student ","oh okay let me see now they know it's not water deep craters small machine that's equipment lunar orbiter that's probably equipment i suppose it your microscopic scientific tool that's equipment microscope that's clear but ok so there's four four times they mentioned equipment in the story "
189,210.4,Luis,,"awesome student and which piece of equipment do you think is the most important here ","oh i don't know "
191,110.1,Luis,,"all right i'll let you think about that question while i work with someone else and then i'll come back to you okay ","okay "
193,230.1,Jazmin,,"all right student can you tell me more about your answer what made you say nasa sent a small machine ","yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
200,230.1,Jazmin,,"would be can you tell me more about this small machine ","it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and it lands at the moon south pole uh huh. "
203,210.3,Jazmin,,"awesome so student how could you rewrite your answer to include that piece of information ","i'm okay um nasa sent a small machine to land on the moon and look for ice deposits analyze polar crater "
206,110.1,Jazmin,,"yeah that's a great answer student ","okay that's pretty easy i can just add that part to my answer and then i'm done "
210,130.2,Jazmin,,"about luis's new answer and compare your new answers while i work with other people ","i just need to write something down and so we don't need to write anything just so we have to talk about it "
212,130.2,Jazmin,,,"okay "
220,230.1,Farrah,,"student can you tell me more about your answer and why you said what you did ","oh yeah so my answer was i'm a scientist you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely why did i say it all cuz i think that was the answer to the question and it was in the story and we had to find our enter in the store "
223,230.2,Farrah,,"so student can you read the line for me again where you found it in the story what does it say ","yeah i'm okay so it says well i mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
227,210.3,Farrah,,"okay and our question is what equipment did the scientists use so does that sentence mentioned that the scientists actually use a microscope student ","oh um in that sentence no i guess you need us oh no i guess i don't know "
231,230.1,Chris,,"okay so student you had the same answer is student can you tell me why you put that answer as well ","um yeah yeah i can tell you oh you know what while he's looking did you i went to nasa and i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and "
233,230.1,Chris,,"yeah so student you're right those are all great examples of equipment so you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon can you tell me more about that answer ","yeah i'm cause i was looking for where they were talking about looking for water because that's what the question was asking about discovering water and in the first paragraph they they say that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
236,310.1,Chris,,"yeah so student i love that you used your background knowledge about nasa and that you're using evidence from the reading ","oh yeah it says or what equipment at times is used to discover water on the moon "
238,310.1,Oliver,,,"oh well i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i just was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so um thanks for working with us bye "
244,230.1,Chris,,"all right hi class welcome so thank you so much for those answers student i want to start with your answer so student can you tell me more about what made you say your answer ","yeah i was looking for the keywords about like discovering water on the moon and in the first paragraph there's a part where they say water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so that kind of felt like it "
250,120.3,Chris,,"one thing i want to ask you to look at is the first part of our question so can you read the first part of the question for me student ","just the first one "
253,210.3,Chris,,"did scientists yeah so we're thinking about equipment student student does your answer mentioned equipment ","it doesn't "
255,420.3,Luis,,"awesome so student i want you to go back to the text and i want you to find me a piece of equipment that the scientists use okay ","yeah okay um i don't think i'm a should be in this class i already know all about space "
258,230.1,Luis,,"yeah so why don't you tell me more about your answer let me just say your answer ","and i will because i know that scientists use oxygen tanks to read "
261,210.3,Luis,,"We are trying to use this text, so does this text mention those oxygen tanks at all Luis. ","um okay to be honest i didn't really read that whole thing cuz i figured i already knew the answer "
263,420.3,Luis,,"awesome well student i have a job for you i want you to look at this text and find me a piece of equipment that the text mentions okay student ","okay "
268,230.1,Oliver,,"student and student you had the same answer so dave i'm going to ask you to start student what made you say your answer ","oh well maybe i think that's the answer to the question "
271,230.1,Oliver,,"say more why is it the answer to the question student ","i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house they're talking about water the found and then they also named a piece of equipment which is a microscope so it's got science water they found and the microscope in "
274,230.1,Farrah,,"student was your reasoning similar to olivers for why you said this answer was it different ","um i mean i guess he was pretty similar yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong because if it answers the question about a science equipment the microscope has the equipment and they are using it to look at the water "
282,210.3,Farrah,,"my question for both of you is did the scientists actually use that equipment when they were working on the moon ","let me see this means the moon is dry the water they found us microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it we need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean i guess i don't say bye all of all there are looking i thought microscope alone "
286,420.3,Chris,,"At least here in this case so Farrah and deb I want you to look back at the text and see if you can find a piece of equipment that the scientists used when they were discovering the water so look back at the text and see if you can find a better piece of equipment. ","cuz i was just listening to the conversation and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and "
290,120.4,Chris,,"student did you find the piece of equipment in the text yet ","yeah sorry i got distracted i was listening um yeah i think it's the lunar orbiter "
292,230.3,Jazmin,,"oh okay student you said something like that didn't you ","yeah i said nasa send a small machine "
295,230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so student can you say more about where you found that in the text or why you said that ","i found it in the second paragraph and it's the very first sentence yeah that one was mine too "
298,210.4,Jazmin,,"so it's in the text you both found this in the text so my question for you is what does this small machine do student what is the machine doing ","it lands at the moon south pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
302,210.4,Jazmin,,,"it looks for well yeah yeah cuz it's looking for ice so that's something yeah yeah. "
304,120.4,Luis,,"yeah so student what did you find you were reading what did you find for me ","i'm the same thing that they found that the lunar orbiter "
306,130.2,Oliver,,"yeah student and student have you class were both reading did you find something similar or something different to harris and student and student ","well i mean that's the only other equipment that they have in the story is the lunar orbiter "
309,530.1,Oliver,,"great job class so how has your thinking changed ","um you know what teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on but i was just thinking i wanted to say thank you for helping me use evidence from the text in my answer and arm and it made me feel valued when you asked me kind of questions about my answer sometimes teachers just tell me about how wrong i am and so i i appreciate it "
311,530.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye teacher see you next time "
314,120.4,Luis,,"hi so can you class repeat your answers to the question for me real quick and we'll go down the line from student all the way down to student from right from my right to from my left to my right yeah student do have a question ","yeah yeah before we do that excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
317,120.4,Farrah,,"student repeat for me what your answer was real quick ","yes okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
319,120.4,Oliver,,"great thank you and you student ","yeah i'm i circled the same as student "
321,120.4,Chris,,"wonderful student ","okay well i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
323,120.4,Jazmin,,"nice and student ","okay well i said that nasa send a small machine "
325,120.4,Luis,,"great and student ","yeah okay well i'm scientists they use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks "
330,210.2,Oliver,,"absolutely so so let's first like talk about that question when we say the word equipment what what do we mean what does equipment mean ","okay um as like a tool or something you use to do something Oh, like a pencil. "
337,420.3,Jazmin,,"i want you all to circle a word or two from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","so i circled two words i circled small machine and i don't understand why and i answer is wrong "
339,210.4,Jazmin,,"So if we're talking about what the equipment, maybe the equipment has a name right So what does that small machine have a name does anybody anybody circle what that small machine is called. ","i can i can look "
341,210.4,Jazmin,,,"okay um nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
343,120.4,Jazmin,,"great so if i were to ask you again what kind of equipment do they use what would you would what would you circle ","so so i just need to circle then maybe i just need to circle lunar orbiter "
347,420.3,Farrah,,"so for saying what equipment did scientist use discover water on the moon maybe you can look for keywords like like the name of the equipment ","okay well microscope that's also equipment so um why is it the lunar orbiter and not the microscope "
353,210.4,Farrah,,"so if we're looking at both of those sentences and if you're looking for those two words lunar orbiter and microscope are there any words that kind of signal to you what the equipment is ","yeah well it says that there's it's a scientific tool so that tells me it's equipment "
357,420.3,Chris,,"who remembers when student asked what equipment was and student said that it's like a tool right so you can look for keywords like that ","yeah well actually it's a comment um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
361,150.1,Chris,,"does class have any questions about about what i mean when i say specific examples ","oh so it has to be from the story "
368,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense to class does class have any clarifying questions that that they have yeah def ","oh well actually i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because your explanations were were really specific and that really helped us understand why each one of our answers could could be even better so thank you so much "
372,220.1,Luis,,"the first thing i want us to talk about when we're here in this class is i want you to think what is this question asking what what does it mean to circle evidence yeah student ","um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
378,510.1,Farrah,,"so can somebody tell me, and I want to see your hands raised, what does it mean to find evidence. ","okay um evidence means like a word or a sentence that's in the story that you use when you answer the question "
387,230.3,Jazmin,,"so a couple of you put that they would need a microscope right ","i think i found that equipment in my answer i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
395,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","um yeah but i did that um the first part the first sentence in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. "
400,510.1,Chris,,"alright student can you explain to me what evidence is ","okay um so like student said it's like um something um from the story that answers the question "
402,210.3,Oliver,,"absolutely so student if i asked you what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon how would you answer that using this textual evidence ","okay well i mean i guess it sounds like the right answer is you know lunar orbiter um and that's in the text but i kind of think there's evidence that um the microscope's the right answer too "
408,430.2,Chris,,"so student and student both circled microscope that is a half the answer but you should also include something that helped them get to the water and how they were able to look closely at it ","will i um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
412,510.1,Chris,,"when we're looking for evidence we need to find certain specific things that are in that text that will help us ","so i have to find the equipment in the story "
416,530.1,Oliver,,"alright so can somebody tell me how maybe they're thinking has changed throughout this conversation ","um okay so um i guess what i learned is that um i should read the story really carefully because um even if i have part of the answer i might be missing part of the answer "
418,110.1,Jazmin,,"absolutely what about you student ","um i learned to make sure that i read the whole sentence or or that my answer is really clear "
421,110.1,Chris,,"absolutely student what about you ","okay um i learned that if it says evidence you have to say something in the story "
424,230.3,Oliver,,"but there was like a little parts that concern me and i wanted to help you class sort of find that you can fix those answers by looking for things like evidence and complete answers student yeah ","um i'm sorry but it's time for us to go now "
429,120.3,Farrah,,"student do you want to read it for me ","oh yeah yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on moon "
431,420.1,Luis,,"all right class i want you right now to look at this question and i want you to underline in this question what you think the most important word or the keyword is in this question ","yeah so i kind of know like all about space like i don't think i really need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff "
433,110.3,Luis,,"well i completely understand that and i can tell from your answer that you do know a lot of things about space because you talked about oxygen tanks and so i can tell that you do know a lot about space but i just want us to help drill in on this specific answer for this question okay ","okay "
435,420.1,Luis,,"do you mind reading this question for me and finding this word that you think is really important in it ","yeah like the question on the text "
438,420.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon um any you said that question like we can you say it again "
440,420.1,Luis,,"yes i can i want you to look back at this question that you just read to me and i want you to find the most important word or the keyword that you think is most important in this question ","oh i got it okay um equipment "
446,110.4,Chris,,"okay awesome so that is a great word to underline did class else underline anything else ","okay so i was saying that you know scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i i was i was underlining um i i was underlining wait in the question or in the text "
448,420.1,Chris,,"in the question which most important word did you pick out ","oh yeah okay so i i underlined water "
451,110.4,Farrah,,"okay good so we have some people that underlined equipment and we have some people that underlined water and those are both very good those are both very important yes student ","i just was wondering because it seems like okay so we said equipment i was just wondering like why my answer was was wrong because i like i feel like microscope is equipment "
457,120.4,Oliver,,"okay does class want to raise their hand and tell me what they think the action word is ","um yeah so it looks like the action word is discovered as that's yeah that seems like the one "
460,230.1,Jazmin,,"that is absolutely correct and does class know can someone tell me what discover means ","discover basically means to like find something like to discover buried treasure "
466,410.2,Chris,,"So Farrah with your question, you tell me about a tool which was great. But when you tell me about the tool. You told me about a tool that's used to look at the water and we're not looking at the water really closely. What are we trying to do to the water, guys. ","discover the water Um, yeah, I was just thinking like, Well, I went to NASA with my dad so I know that scientists use a lot of other equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits, and I guess I was like that when we talked about like what equipment. It feels like that's missing from the, from the reading or I don't know. Like, that seems like it's important "
470,210.2,Oliver,,"so in this one it's going to tell us about the equipment that's used for water so what does equipment mean class ","it's like machines or or things you use to help you do something "
475,120.3,Oliver,,"so we are going to look back in our passage so i will class to get back into their passage ","so right now we are trying to answer the question what equipment good so it's like a machine that we're going to use or like a tool I'm so sorry I'm unfortunately we have to go to the next group and have to end this session, but thank you so much. "
477,420.3,Luis,,"so i want class to look in your text at paragraph two and look for any keywords that may help to identify the equipment that was used to specifically discover water ","um yeah i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut "
480,140.1,Luis,,"oh that is so awesome has he told you about these kind of thing ","yeah he he talks about it all the time and like that's how come i know so much about space "
484,210.4,Jazmin,,"So we're going to look at, paragraph two, okay. So I just want you to listen while I am reading and if we find a particular equipment we might stop and talk about it. Okay. ","so like a small machine it's a piece of equipment right like it's something you could use use "
486,110.4,Jazmin,,"good that is exactly right so a small machine is a piece of equipment and what is this piece of equipment called ","it is a lunar orbiter "
489,110.4,Farrah,,"exactly and they're saying that they're using the lunar orbiter to investigate ","yes so investigates like when you're a detective and you're like getting clues and finding out the truth "
493,210.2,Oliver,,"good does class know a synonym for the word investigate ","yeah um okay so synonym is like something that's like the same like a word that means the same thing right yeah exactly awesome yeah um a synonym for investigage is like is find the same "
495,420.1,Chris,,"so now let's look back at our question and see if we can find a word in our question that is a synonym for investigate ","oh oh oh "
497,120.1,Chris,,"student do you think you know it ","yeah yeah discover "
504,120.1,Luis,,"does class know ","i yeah yeah i know an ice deposit's like on a planetoid or like a rocky planet or a moon on that it's like like ice like frozen water that's that's like on on the surface of the planet "
507,310.1,Jazmin,,"Great, I can really tell you use your background knowledge with that. So you're absolutely right and ice deposit is a piece of frozen water that's on a planet. ","I think I know the answer. "
509,210.1,Jazmin,,"okay do you want to share your answer with us ","so i think i was really close it's the lunar orbiter the lunar orbiter's what discovered the water "
513,110.4,Chris,,"that's great that's absolutely right so class i want you to think so we found this time that that's our specific answer that it was the lunar orbiter ","um i actually forgot what i was gonna say "
517,110.4,Oliver,,,"um yeah so scientists found the craters full of water on the moon so i was wondering like um did they use they use the lunar orbiter to find it but did they not use a microscope "
523,210.4,Oliver,,"you need a scientific toll called a microscope to look really closely so what is that microscope helping them do class ","it's helping them see it when they study it I understand. Yeah, so they they found it using the Lunar Orbiter and they and they studied it using the microscope. So it was like two different things. They say, I understand. "
525,230.1,Oliver,,"yeah and what are those two different things we had discovering it and we have looking at it what are those two words what kind of words are those that we talked about earlier in this lesson ","um synonym "
527,130.3,Oliver,,"no what is the type of word we used but remember way earlier at the beginning of this lesson when we talked about action words ","and that's how we discover discover "
530,510.1,Chris,,"the next time you're reading a tough question it can help you to look for the action words in the question because that's going to help you know specifically what you're looking for ","so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and like specifically like you you really helped us clear up some misconceptions we have like you helped us to understand the meaning of the word discover and you also helped us make sure that we were using evidence when we were talking about stuff because we had to justify it in in the stuff that we were reading and that was really cool so i don't know like i feel like i understand like the question much better now so thank you so much "
535,510.1,Unclear,,,"um hi hi ms teacher name hi hi what's your name "
538,510.1,Unclear,,,"you can't see us "
542,510.1,Bennett,,,"okay ah you're seeing me okay give me one moment "
546,510.1,Bennett,,,"let's try this again um hi okay "
549,510.1,Chris,,,"now do you see me student okay great "
554,150.1,Luis,,"so let's look back in our texts and let's see if we had the best answer let's think about it ","um excuse me um i shouldn't be ni this class i already know all there is to know about space "
556,150.1,Luis,,"okay well we're just going to work on making sure we have the best answer for the question okay ","um okay "
561,150.1,Jazmin,,"so did class talk about that let's see ","well um i it's me student i said that they used a small machine that was my answer "
566,210.4,Jazmin,,"because it's in our passage so let's look back and see if we can find it so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater so what is the name of that machine called ","um well i talked about the polar craters because i said that they found a lot of water in the craters um the small machine "
569,210.4,Jazmin,,"yes the small machine but let's look back and see what that's called so let's read the sentence okay so we're on number two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","oh it's called a lunar orbiter "
574,150.1,Oliver,,"you get it ","oh i don't understand why my answer is still wrong yeah yeah me too i circled the same thing as student "
580,210.4,Farrah,,"now what does a microscope do what did it say a microscope did in the text ","um you use it to look at the water "
583,110.4,Oliver,,"right you use it to look at the water ","yeah "
587,110.4,Oliver,,,"sorry sorry Yeah, it's like, um, it's like, um, you said already. It's like when you find something "
590,210.4,Farrah,,"right so discovers when we find it so we have to find it first and we're going to use the lunar orbiter to find it before we can look at it ","um we have to say that need a scientific tool microscope to discover the water instead of just to look it "
595,210.4,Chris,,"okay but did the text say that we can use the microscope to discover the water ","because let's look back at our passage and see what a microscope does Yeah, Farrah, she said discover means to find it and and we we thought the thing said to to look at it which is different from finding it. well i know a lot about space too i went to nasa with my dad and i know that astronauts um they have like oxygen tanks and um they have suits and they have masks "
599,110.1,Chris,,"that's really cool but let's get back on topic ","okay okay well well i talked about water in my answer too "
605,210.3,Chris,,"does it say anything about the equipment that they used ","oh no no it talks about the craters not the equipment "
614,210.4,Farrah,,"this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small and what is ice ","oh oh yeah ice is the same thing as water oh right yeah yeah oh yeah i see that ice is like it's the same thing because we learned that in science class about how like the three states of matter "
616,210.4,All,,,"bye "
620,120.2,Luis,,"alright so the discussion question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","uh excuse me yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
622,120.4,Luis,,"okay so what is your answer to the discussion question ","um let me see i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i already know that equipment that they use "
631,110.1,Chris,,"um well you're right ","um um what did they use to discover water on the moon um i don't know um like maybe oh well i said that they found craters full of water on the moon "
635,210.2,Farrah,,"but the question wants to know what equipment did they use ","well in my answer i i talked about the equipment it's me student i said that they they used a scientific tool called a microscope to to look really closely "
637,210.2,Oliver,,,"i "
639,210.2,Oliver,,,"i was gonna show you that i have the same answer as samantha "
641,120.4,Oliver,,"okay so what's your answer ","um that they use the microscope to look closely at the water "
644,120.1,Oliver,,"is that all that they used ","um well i mean that's what it says it says here the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it "
646,120.1,Farrah,,,"yeah the um the the next part of that says you know that you'd like let me look at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i mean i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
652,120.4,Luis,,"student what do you think ","well i think that because they they really like to have to travel around a lot that they probably use their like their their their like telescopes to look at the water um well like when they were on earth you know because that's how you can look from earth on "
655,120.4,Jazmin,,,"and mine came from the text too but i don't know why it's wrong um well i i had a different answer "
657,410.2,Jazmin,,"okay you need to be more specific in your answer what small machine what was it called ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate um a lunar orbiter "
661,150.1,Jazmin,,"so that makes sense ","um i mean i guess so i guess "
664,150.1,Farrah,,"class have any questions about that question ","um well i mean i guess i don't know i mean i guess it's like but i still think like the microscope is is equipment too "
666,130.3,Chris,,"it is but they didn't use it to discover the water ","i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
670,110.2,Oliver,,"you're all right ","okay um but but but but okay so but i read it and it does say it such that they talk about the water in paragraph three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i understand that you said that student has the right answer but but why cuz that's a tool too "
674,130.3,Oliver,,"but then they use the microscope once they found it ","oh "
676,150.1,Oliver,,"that make sense ","okay they use the lunar orbiter to um they use the lunar orbiter to find the water and then i use the microscope to look at the water "
679,110.4,Oliver,,"right once they found it ","okay um okay class i so i get it because you you you told student what it is but i guess i i don't know like how how you got there like i know i can say it but i don't know how how um okay oh look student i think well it's time for us to go to lunch but i think what she was telling us is that we just have to keep looking at the text right cuz that's where you said a bunch of times like you gotta go back to the text you gotta go back to the text so so okay yeah thanks thanks i think we gotta look at the text more student that was the problem okay bye thank you "
681,110.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i'm not sure like why i'm here because i already know like all sorts of stuff about space "
688,410.1,Luis,,"also student your question or your answer had to do with equipment as well but you talked about oxygen tanks and we're trying to figure out which equipment they used for discovering water not oxygen on the moon ","now it's so they don't need the oxygen if they're going up to space "
690,210.2,Luis,,"they need oxygen but we're specifically talking about which piece of equipment they used to discover water on the moon ","ah ok gotcha yeah "
692,210.2,Farrah,,,"um yeah i guess i was just wondering like what my answer was because i'm i'm still not quite sure like i can understand that they were looking for the equipment but but they didn't use the but the microscope wasn't the right answer "
697,130.3,Farrah,,"the microscope is used for a different purpose they didn't use a microscope on the men they use something else to discover water on the moon ","oh what do you do you "
699,130.3,,,,"you want all of us to look at the text or are we just waiting for the vamp "
703,120.4,Chris,,"student did you find the answer ","um yeah i guess i well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like when like oxygen tanks at masks and shoot "
712,210.4,Jazmin,,"Go back and look what's another word that we can use Jazmin. ","another word is a small maching "
714,210.4,Jazmin,,,"a small machine right "
722,130.3,Luis,,"so the equipment that they used is the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon ","um yeah i just wanted to let you know my dad is actually an astronaut "
731,210.4,Jazmin,,"The water on the main for ","is there anything that you missed it "
733,210.4,Jazmin,,"what do astronauts use the water for ","you that like the water "
736,210.4,Jazmin,,,"you could use the water on the moon in a garden and they could be like a moon garden out of it "
739,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry i said that you could like you could go and use the water and you can see "
746,210.2,Chris,,"Or how can it be useful. ","um yeah so you could basically be like i also waters so you know it's really good that they don't have to carry it in ships "
749,230.3,Luis,,"right okay that can be one way that can be so they don't have to use a travel with it there they can use what's on the man ","um well water can be the said water can be broken down into two parts like hydrogen and oxygen "
754,210.4,Jazmin,,"all right and how do they use the hydrogen and oxygen ","well and use oxygen to breath and the water to stay hydrated and feel like they have to have water "
757,110.1,Luis,,"right a then what were you gonna say ","well well i was gonna say like they use it for like rocket people they can use hydrogen and make make food for the spacecraft "
767,130.3,Farrah,,"yeah so can we all agree that water is a valuable resource ","i'm still kind of you know like i i saw the parts that they were saying where they were like you could use the hydrogen fuel and you can use the oxygen to breathe but i don't think it's like convincing evidence mostly because i didn't think that it would be possible for a long time so like i guess evidence doesn't seem very convinced because they say like in really they said i use the moon water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting getting out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money "
769,110.1,Farrah,,"yeah ","it would be you know like it would take a long time "
773,130.3,Oliver,,"it would take a long time but eventually it would be very very very valuable resource for astronauts to use ","well i guess i sort of agree with student i got it kind of depends on like that time so if you're looking at it are like like immediately then yeah it's not very useful but i guess in like theory but that's kind of a question like i i guess i don't know if i see that like even if it's useful someday if it's really valuable you know "
780,310.1,Jazmin,,"i can see the way you're thinking about it student ","and yet i just wanted to say and we have to match the lunch i just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular like something i really wanted to thank you for was like we were really able to understand like you explain what we need to work on and you know etc and how to improve you also really clear with like what you were concerned about and like what you wanted to work which is like able to get you gives us a chance to like go forward and figure out like what like i better today so much for all your work day was great working "
783,310.1,Chris,,,"um hi "
788,120.2,Luis,,"so you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space "
791,150.1,Luis,,"you ready ","okay yeah "
796,130.3,Oliver,,"and so that is how they discovered that there was ice on the moon or water ","um i had the same answer as student "
800,230.2,Farrah,,"yes you do but did you read the article because i'm not sure that you really need that answer because you circled the same as her ","Oh no, I would never do that. I know a lot of stuff. I like to watch stuff on YouTube and I like to read about space too. Um, I circled it, I circled that because I know that um that a microscope is is like a tool and this says, this says, if you look at the whole thing . It says that the moon is drier than the dryest desert on Earth. Why did they find ice microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you look straight at it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. oh yeah well that is why "
804,110.1,Farrah,,"you did some great reading student ","Oh, well, well, it's just that you know, um, me and Farrah both found the same thing right, Farrah? yeah yeah i mean like when i was i was looked at it and i saw that the question was asking about equipment and so um it said a scientific tool and a scientific tool like a microscope that's the same thing as equipment "
807,130.3,Jazmin,,"but even you did circle if you circled the same thing as student you are at you at you were both actually not correct with that answer so if you would have circled about the lunar orbiter you would have been correct ","um but okay well i don't understand what why my answer is wrong um me student right here "
812,110.4,Jazmin,,"okay student student you put nasa sent a small machine yes they did they did send a small machine it was called the lunar orbiter ","yeah But then why, my, here, if I was right "
814,110.4,Jazmin,,,"this table is for class who got the wrong answer you asked us to come over here because you wanted to talk about our answers so is my answer right or is my answer wrong "
816,130.1,Jazmin,,"it is semi right you could have went into more detail you put that it was a small machine and it was a small machine but um it is called a lunar orbiter ","um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter "
818,120.3,Jazmin,,"the equipment was called a lunar or orbiter that nasa sent to investigate ","okay okay but didn't i "
820,120.3,Jazmin,,,"well well i just mean like okay so i have the first part of the sentence i just i just didn't have that one word or like those words so that's all i needed "
822,130.3,Jazmin,,"it says nasa send a small mach small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that should have been your answer ","oh okay well okay now i know the answer "
826,130.3,Chris,,,"um well i went to nasa and i know th oh sorry that's that's me student excuse me um okay so the answer is is it's called a lunar orbiter "
829,130.3,Chris,,,"yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
833,410.1,Chris,,"they do but that's not what the um that's not what the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover the water on the moon it said that those things are not what they used to discover water on the moon it was the lunar orbiter ","oh oh okay okay so i get it like i know that that's the answer like the lunar orbiter is the answer but but i thought that i had the right answer you know because i talked about the water in my answer about like how they they found the water because i know that you know to discover stuff means to find stuff and so i saw in paragraph one where i was looking for like okay they find some water and it says that scientists found evidence that water can be found deep within a moon's polar craters so so like that's that's how i got my answer and so i "
836,210.2,Oliver,,"What equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon. That would be your question. So that question didn't ask anything about what they found, as what did they use to find it. ","um oh okay okay um excuse me it's it's me student hi "
838,210.2,Oliver,,,"um i just wanted to say that it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for coming to work with us and to really telling us to keep keep looking at the text because i heard you say that to class over here like that we have to like we have to look look at the text some more to try to find the answer so "
840,210.2,Oliver,,,"um okay thank you "
843,210.2,Luis,,,"bye hi "
845,210.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i really need to be in this "
847,110.1,Luis,,"let's just hang out for a minute let's talk about some things okay ","yeah i could do that "
852,120.4,Farrah,,"nd first i'd like to address student student would you like to read your answer to us ","yeah sure okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool calle a microscope to look really closely "
855,310.1,Farrah,,"you did mention a specific piece of equipment and although that may not be the best answer and you still address the equipment part of the question and i appreciate that ","thank you "
857,230.3,Oliver,,"you're welcome and and student you said that you had circled the same thing as student so i'm assuming that you address that you were thinking that it was the microscope as well ","yeah i had a microscope and i kind of thought same thing as student "
859,230.3,Farrah,,,"i guess i still don't really understand why my answers wrong "
866,410.2,Farrah,,"okay and in your answer you said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah you would need a microscope to look really closely closely but does your answer tell what discovered the water ","oh interesting so well i guess what i thought was that you couldn't discover the water unless you saw the water maybe there's another way that another machine could find the water "
869,130.2,Oliver,,"yes why don't why don't you look back you and student work together since you were you had the same answer ","okay "
873,120.4,Chris,,"okay student would you like to read your answer ","yeah okay so i said that pre scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
877,210.3,Chris,,"did what important word or words did you circle in the question ","so i circled water that was the main word that i circled "
882,210.2,Chris,,"so do you think one of the important words could be equipment ","yeah and it's okay so it's asking what equipment yeah i was thinking about the craters "
886,210.2,Chris,,,"I you know my dad took me to NASA. And when we were there. We saw that like the astronauts used like suits and oxygen tanks and tasks and stuff. yeah like it wasn't in the reading did they use those to discover the water "
888,130.3,Chris,,"no they might have used those when they discovered it but they were not use to discover the water ","okay gotcha "
890,120.4,Jazmin,,"yes okay and student would you like to read us your answer ","nasa sent a small machine "
894,120.4,Luis,,"and student that would you like to read as your answer ","um yeah okay so basically what i said i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that "
896,210.3,Luis,,"and they do use that but i'm just like with student i asked him did they use that to discover the water ","i guess not like i guess they must have used they used it but they didn't use it to discover the water like that's not the job of like the tank or the mask "
898,110.4,Jazmin,,"exactly yes student ","fortunate we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really interesting it was really fun to work with thank you "
901,110.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i got all this stuff figured out so you know i think i'm all good "
906,150.1,Farrah,,"all right um student and student did you class get a chance to finish reading paragraph two and revise your answer ","so we did look through paragraph two we saw you know a couple different things in there i think that we have a new answer but we're still a little bit confused about like you know i'm still kind of like i i think the answer is the lunar orbiter right "
909,230.1,Farrah,,"why are you confused and then we'll talk about the answer ","yeah so i think when i'm confused by is um i guess that they have the microscope and they said that that's like a piece of equipment it is and i just i'm just wondering like if the waters microscopic could they find it without a microscope "
912,210.4,Farrah,,"it landed on the moon that's where they found it and it looked for ice deposits so since it was ice and it wasn't necessarily water it is but frozen water and they look in the large polar craters i guess it was really cold ","it seems really cool "
917,110.4,Chris,,"yes it does and i'm but yes you are you two are correct it is the lunar orbiter so you are right there ","but that's okay um can i share my answer with you yeah i saw my original my original answer was that scientists found craters full of water on the food and then i think we were talking about how that wasn't really answering the question right "
919,230.1,Chris,,"right so did you say you have a new answer ","yeah i think so i'm like i think that i could see like student and student said the lunar orbiter was the thing that that found it like that sounds like that's the answer "
923,230.2,Jazmin,,"did you have a chance did you go back and look and find the same answer or did you find something different ","although i see actually that confused because it kind of makes sense that all i was missing was the name of the machine right so i said like nasa send this small machine but i have to say like what evidence is i have to say what it is right "
926,230.3,Luis,,"it student and we see here and we were talking about using all the other equipment right ","yeah "
928,150.1,Luis,,"and i don't think you had did you have a chance to go back and read paragraph two ","um no i didn't take a look yet "
932,120.3,Oliver,,"okay go ahead and do that for a moment ","um so i i read something interesting would like is connected i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so maybe they could use these things like i'm like the water pretty soon "
938,120.4,Luis,,"okay student what do you think ","so i looked at paragraph two and what we see and like what i was listening to class i'm like they said that the lunar orbiter was the thing and so i guess that makes sense that it was the lunar orbiter i'm like that's the answer to the question i guess i just keep thinking like they must have used other stuff but you said that that they didn't use the suits and the oxygen to find the water they used it to help them beyond the moon if they were on the moon "
940,210.1,Luis,,"right to help them survive ","yeah yeah exactly "
948,150.1,Jazmin,,"guess that's all that i have unless you have some questions yes student ","i know i think that we all understand and i think that we just wanted to share so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really do thank you for like making sure that our answers were really accurate and you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and you also asked us like why we were like saying the things that we were saying so we got this think about like our own thinking and how that led to our answer like right class um yeah like i think class feels like they got to do something really interesting and i think that that like working with your class was really cool and like we also had time to explain all of our ideas and finally i think class really value so like everybody's answers like you were so like like supportive of our answers even even if they were right and that was really cool thank you so much for working with us it was really fun "
953,120.4,Luis,,"so let's talk about some of your answers would one of you like to volunteer your answer student ","well i was just gonna say like i already know like so much about space and like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class "
956,120.4,Luis,,"can we start with your answer student ","yeah sure so basically what what i said was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
962,230.2,Luis,,"maybe other equipment that they might have used to just find oxygen or excuse me just to find the water on the moon what some other points that you made for us in our passage we read what were some other points they made ","well i have to be honest i don't think i read it very close because i thought i knew all this stuff but it sounds like there's other equipment that maybe i didn't know and so i'm kind of looking through now and i'm seeing other equipment and you were saying like i need to think about like how like what is really finding the water is that right like not like maybe what they use also but like what really binds it is that right "
968,120.4,Jazmin,,"great can somebody volunteers for me to give me a word that you might have underlined that can help us find an answer student ","yes in the way that i underlined was well action like two words equipment and discover "
970,210.4,Jazmin,,"so you underlined equipment and discover great so tell me just reading our passage student can you tell me what the word equipment might refer to in our passage what kind of equipment did the scientists discover water on the moon with ","yeah so that's like something that you use to find or do you use like if you need something they have to discover certain equipment has the evening mean i use it to discover and so i said that it's the small machine "
973,310.1,Jazmin,,"excellent excellent thank you i see your line of thought and i really appreciate that you're telling us that they sent a small machine which is the equipment and they used it to discover which is to find out or to see ","i was wondering why my answer the question my answer was wrong you know why i was in the class it sounds like this small machine was was maybe a right answer "
978,210.3,Chris,,"so student when we read deeper into that passage and the answer that you gave us how else could they have found or what other oliverices could they have used to find water on the moon in the craters ","ah well i guess that's i kind of was thinking about what he was saying because i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that they use masks and suits an oxygen text to explore them so i guess i was thinking maybe they use that stuff to go in the craters "
980,230.3,Chris,,"so you were thinking they use a lot more equipment on their body to go into the craters like he was talking about oxygen tanks ","yeah like maybe you know like i guess i'm not yeah like i was thinking like did they use that to go into craters and see like i i understand like it's not as much water like but like you know if we went in the crater like there's they find the water by like walking in with their space suits "
986,120.3,Oliver,,"And made it says, NASA send a small machine called the Lunar Orbiter to investigate. Now the lunar orbiter will land on the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in large polar craters ","very small I'm, I'm so sorry. But unfortunately, we have to go to our next class. I hate to interrupt, but we have to run. But thank you so much for working with us. It was really fun to work with you. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye. "
993,120.3,Luis,,,"my answer was that you know is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable i think no and i think that because i don't think it will be a long long time um yeah and i i agree like i think know as well i don't think that's very convincing because it's not really ready so even though we think it could work like we don't know yeah i said basically the water is so good that ships don't carry it what if you don't have to carry anymore so basically i think yes that there's really convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you class are fine without water and also i was just going to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool on yeah and i really like was gonna say like water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
996,120.4,Farrah,,"i wanted to just student if you remind me of your answer ","so no not for a long time i don't think that the evidence is "
1000,230.2,Farrah,,"and what makes you think that way student based on our passage what makes you think that the evidence is not convincing ","yeah that's a really interesting question so when i look at the like here's what i saw i was thinking that okay a paragraph six it says to use the water scientists need to come up with a plan for extract or getting out of the polar crater the water and it says making this plan will take a lot of time and i was thinking like honestly that like it doesn't work yet so i think that maybe it would be valuable sure and i think it's very valuable right we don't even know how to how to do it so we could use "
1010,210.3,Farrah,,"student do you think that could be is an important way to express that water can be valuable in the future ","yeah i think what's interesting because i do think that it could be valuable maybe sure i see that in the reading it's not really valuable like that the evidence is it because we haven't seen like them build like a winner waters and we don't even know they can like they can we haven't seen "
1015,120.4,Chris,,"um let's see who was it that told me that the water is heavy and carrying the water was maybe not a good idea student was that you ","yes that was me i was saying that you don't have to have water anymore get it from the moon "
1020,230.3,Chris,,"am i correct student is that you're thinking ","yeah "
1023,230.3,Chris,,,"oh i just said totally "
1034,230.1,Oliver,,"student and were you a person who said no can you tell me your answer and give me some of the thinking that you had in mind ","yeah i would love to unfortunately we do have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to share with you some really cool stuff like i wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular you really helped us to focus on like certain words in the questions so that we understood like what we were looking for and i think that made things a lot more quicker and then like on top of that like you helped us to understand like you help us clarify our answers you know what i mean and you asked us about our thinking and like when we started like thinking about like what we were saying i think class right like class kind of had a moment of like you know like everything makes a lot more sense when we're like trying to you know what i mean like like we can understand and we can hear each other and we can think about like what class else's and then even like beyond that like you really help us to feel value like once you like heard about what we were thinking i think that like class felt like you really respected us and that was so cool because that's not like every teacher so i really appreciate that and thank you so much for just like giving it a try though thank you bye "
1037,120.3,Luis,,"so can one of you would one of you like to volunteer to read the first paragraph ","yeah sure i'll read it um me student i'll read it but but i do want to say i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class cuz i already know a lot about space "
1040,110.3,Luis,,"well you know what because you do know a lot and that means you can help the rest of us out that don't know as much as you ","oh yeah okay cool yeah okay um first paragraph scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
1045,110.3,Chris,,,"That scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters. These craters are dark places where the sun never shines. well like the craters on the moon are really dark um well "
1048,110.3,Chris,,,"um well also that that's where they found the water "
1052,120.3,Chris,,"okay would you like student would you like to read the second paragraph ","yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small "
1055,510.1,Jazmin,,"It means, means put it in your own words on what that you heard that paragraph say ","um well i'm looking at it and um i think it says like okay nasa sent this whole machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar creator these ice deposits are very small okay so it's saying like they sent they sent the lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits "
1057,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah what would deposits be what do you think they would look like ","um i don't know like like ice i guess "
1059,140.1,Farrah,,"okay when you deposit something how much do what do you deposit do you have a deposit a really large piece of something or smaller pieces ","um well i go to the bank with my mom sometimes and she'll deposit her paycheck but i don't know if it's like a lot of money or like a small amount of money "
1063,140.1,Farrah,,"well when you think of a paycheck every week that would be a smaller amount for what you would make for the entire month does that make sense ","um i guess so but i don't i still don't understand why my answer is wrong well it's not wrong but i'm just wanting you to look at it and different views so in one week that might be a lot of money but when you look at it over a whole month that's only a partial of the money "
1065,150.1,Farrah,,"does that makes sense ","i mean i guess so because i don't have a job and so like so i don't really get like you know for grownups and and how much money they have um "
1067,110.1,Farrah,,"that's okay ","but but i actually i was talking about like my answer to the question because cuz i i wrote that let me see what did i circle okay i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely like i don't get why is that a wrong answer "
1070,130.3,Oliver,,"well they didn't send a microscope they sent a machine called the lunar orbit orbiter right ","but the microscope is a machine um yeah "
1078,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make a little bit more sense ","um i mean i guess i mean i guess cuz you're you you did tell me like i hear what you're saying like they sent i sent this lunar orbiter um but what okay i had it's me student i have the same answer as savannha right um cuz i looked at the the the story and i looked at the question and the question says what equipment did scientists use so i was like looking and to discover the water i was like you know i was i was looking at the um story to for for equipment and look for like i'm looking for water yeah i did the same thing and i was like okay a microscope is like a tool and tool is like equipment and they said that they they use it to look for the water and so yeah that's the same "
1082,130.1,Chris,,"well you are you are partially correct but the the equipment that they sent was this machine called the lunar orbiter and that was able to go across the ground the surface the moon surface to check for these deposits ","um yeah i went to nasa with my dad and so i know a lot about this stuff too in space like the astronauts need oxygen tanks and they need masks and they need suits too yes they do "
1084,120.3,Luis,,"so would someone like to read me the third paragraph ","um i can read it "
1087,120.3,Luis,,,"okay um that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely oh yeah that's where you that's where you got your answer student and student "
1090,140.1,Luis,,"have you seen on your mom's car windows or the grass ","um um yeah like on a car "
1093,210.4,Luis,,"okay that is moisture but that's still bigger than the moisture they found on the moon we can see frost with our naked eye but what they found on the moon we would not even be able to tell that it's there without the lunar orbiter and the microscope being able to see that ","okay i'm a little bit but i just looked at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so um i just want to say thanks for for coming to our class and really taking some time to listen to all of our ideas because sometimes the teachers don't always listen to everything that we have to say and trying to help us with a question "
1100,230.2,Luis,,"the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks where did you find evidence that ","okay well yeah i i can read it i also want to say that i don't think i should be in this class i already know a lot about space "
1103,110.3,Luis,,"well that will really help us by you knowing some things because you might be able to teach us some things we don't know ","okay okay what did you want me to read "
1107,230.2,Luis,,"where paragraph does it talk about the scientists use a equipment like oxygen tanks ","okay i'm walking well i guess i don't really see oxygen tanks in here i was just something i know i know "
1109,110.2,Luis,,"okay um we definitely need oxygen when we go to space don't we because we don't have oxygen up there like we do here ","yeah scientists can't breathe the astronauts can't breathe out oxygen tank "
1113,120.3,Chris,,"let's look at our passages and let's see what paragraph that that might be can class tell me ","i found my answer paragraph one because they were talking about the water there about how there's a lot of water in the craters "
1116,120.4,Farrah,,"what about number paragraph two could class find that answer ","yeah i found the equipment but it wasn't an aircraft to i found the equipment in paragraph three because yeah "
1118,230.2,Farrah,,"great can you tell me where what you found ","yeah so in paragraph three it says that the water they found is microscopic and they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1120,230.1,Farrah,,"excellent why would a microscope help us see the water ","because you need a microscope to look at things "
1122,230.1,Farrah,,"because it's so it's so big or it's so small ","because it's so small "
1125,210.4,Farrah,,"okay do you think the water on the moon looks the same as a glass of water that we would drink ","i don't know "
1131,210.4,Farrah,,"When, when it says we're not able to see it. ","Okay. let me see you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
1133,210.4,Farrah,,"So what does that tell us that the water on the moon is what compared to the water that we have here. ","it's like really really small "
1135,110.1,Farrah,,"yeah ","like not a lot of it maybe "
1138,210.4,Farrah,,"so there might be lots of it there but it's so small we can't see it with our naked eye do you know have you heard the term before naked eye yeah ","my mom says it a lot but i i just i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1146,120.3,Farrah,,"says and and paragraph to the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater ","How's the lunar orbiter able to do that. Well, um, they they taught it how to fly and it flew to the moon. "
1150,120.4,Chris,,"student maybe ","yeah well i know that all that and i know that well i went to nasa with my dad and so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
1159,150.1,Farrah,,"you understand that ","i'm thinking about okay so what you're saying is that they sent the lunar orbiter and then they found the water and then they use the microscope to to look at the water "
1163,210.4,Oliver,,"yes because remember in paragraph three it says we wouldn't be able to see the water ","yeah yeah that's why i said that that the equipment was the microscope um yeah i said that to me and i said i said the same thing that the equipment was the microscope um but i think miss donna saying by the answers in paragraph two and not in paragraph three "
1169,130.1,Luis,,"then the tool they used was the microscope ","and it's kind of confusing and i am sorry to interrupt you but i just saw the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i know this was short but thanks for taking the time to work with us "
1171,110.1,All,,"i appreciate you class coming in today you've all done a very good job ","thank you okay bye "
1174,110.1,All,,,"okay hey miss teacher so know that class has told you our answers on what do you think "
1176,110.1,All,,,"okay let's see "
1180,150.1,,,"how does class feel after you read that passage do you feel pretty good you feel a little confused ","i feel like i had the right answer i thought i thought "
1183,150.1,Luis,,,"yeah i think so i don't even know why i'm in this class because i already know everything about space or "
1185,110.3,Luis,,"even that's the nice thing about it because we all know different information and where you know in a little bit more maybe you can teach us some things along the way okay ","that's cool "
1192,230.2,Chris,,"student let's talk about your answer you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon uh huh what paragraph does that tell us that that happened ","in the first paragraph it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be deeper than the polar craters Scientists have found of water can be hmm well i guess because it said that they found evidence about the water that i thought that that meant that they found the water "
1201,230.2,Luis,,"can you help me find in the passage where it talks about oxygen tanks ","i'm sure sure sure sure okie oh okay um well i don't see oxygen tanks in here but i know i already know that they need oxygen tanks to breathe in space "
1204,210.4,Luis,,"what they found on the moon so is there anything in the passage that talks about oxygen ","i'm okay i'm gonna have to look again "
1206,210.4,Jazmin,,,"excuse me "
1208,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1215,120.1,Jazmin,,"but what else what other kind of equipment or tool did they have to use ","oh oh i didn't even i didn't actually say that they said i just said that they sent a small machine "
1220,130.1,Jazmin,,"So that's why I said you're you're on the right track. ","okay "
1223,210.3,Luis,,"student did you find anything was talking about oxygen ","um yeah yeah okay um well okay no it wasn't about oxygen it was just about ice and ice and water in this first part "
1225,210.3,Luis,,,"yeah so so i guess it wasn't it wasn't "
1229,130.2,Jazmin,,"and who can tell me what tool that what tools did they use ","is it the one that i said that we were just talking about the lunar orbiter "
1231,210.4,Farrah,,"What does it say about the water in paragraph three ","it says that you you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight "
1234,110.4,Oliver,,"very good ","That that was my answer. I said that you need a microscope to see, I'm not true. Um, yeah, but our answer was wrong. "
1242,120.3,Oliver,,"can who can read that for sentence to me ","i can read it okay i suppose it's a very small that one "
1245,120.3,Oliver,,,"scientists set up one top of a layer of amount surface let me see oh i don't think i can read it "
1253,210.4,Oliver,,"I couldn't even describe that would be trucks and trucks loads of topsoil okay the upload of the moon and it still would only fill this glass. ","oh ok ok ok i see that now oh wow okay i don't sorry to interrupt our class but i just realized it's time for us to go to lunch by i wanted to take thank you for for helping us to understand some of the meanings of some of the words and and really helping all of us kind of use use evidence from the text in our answer and how are you asked us to keep going back to keep reading and look for it "
1255,210.4,All,,,"bye "
1259,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just thinking like i already know like all that there is to know about space so i don't really think i need to be this class "
1268,120.4,Farrah,,"student let's start with you what word did you circle in your question ","oh my circle two words right "
1271,130.2,Oliver,,"student did you circle those two words ","Yeah I circled the same one. "
1273,120.4,Chris,,"good how about you student ","oh i did as well "
1277,430.2,Farrah,,"so some of your answers did involve equipment but what what you didn't do is use the word discover ","i just i was just wondering well my answer was wrong "
1281,210.2,Farrah,,"but remember the second word that you circled or underlined in the question was discover so they in the paragraph it says that they use this equipment to discover water to find water on the moon ","to be get the microphone because they probably use the microscope to discover i guess i'm still wondering i did "
1288,420.3,Chris,,"and remember your two keywords equipment and discover and look back to see if you can find a paragraph and the passage that uses the words discover and equipment ","um well i was like dad took me to nasa and i was thinking while we were there we saw excited to set us basques shoot and stuff like that so i guess i was wondering like it like is that something that is that an answer "
1295,210.2,Luis,,"In our question that we need to also look for the word discovered what they use to discover, discover is an action word. It's something that they did ","Yeah, I can look "
1300,230.2,Jazmin,,"that's right good job it is the lunar orbiter can you tell me what paragraph you found yes yes student ","oh yeah i can tell you but it's my for the next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this yeah it was really awesome thank you so much "
1303,230.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i was gonna say i just wanted to remind class that um my dad is an astronaut "
1307,420.1,Farrah,,"so again let's look back at our question and look for two keywords that will help us understand what we're looking for in our reading passage ","should we should we circle the words this time "
1314,120.4,Jazmin,,"can someone tell me what two words that they circled ","okay so basically what i said was i said that okay so i circled water and i circle value "
1318,130.1,Farrah,,"valuable okay yes i agree that valuable is a keyword that's right but we're going to look for one more thing one more other keyword in the question so student could you tell me what word another word that you circled ","oh yeah so okay i should actually i had a question because i circled valuable and then i also circle evidence but i thought i should circle convincing too "
1321,210.2,Oliver,,"but yes the two keywords that i was wanting you class to find was evidence and valuable ","oh i think to answer my question "
1323,210.2,Jazmin,,,"so i was just thinking that you could use the water to make a garden on the moon "
1330,120.4,Chris,,"student what did you underline or circle ","okay so what i circled up all right what i was looking at was i was thinking like that water can be broken down into two parts and that was where was that oh yeah in paragraph by water can be broken down two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
1337,120.4,Farrah,,"okay student you know what did you underline or circle ","so okay be what i was looking at well basically i was thinking that it's valuable so the stuff that i was focused on like i was doing the reading was i was looking in the past paragraph paragraph six that are making this plan will take a lot of time like i think it would take a long time and i don't think it would be valuable for for a long time you know what i mean i think it would be valuable maybe sure but i don't think it's valuable right now "
1342,120.4,Oliver,,"Okay. All right. Then what did you underline or circle. ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like making sure that we all felt valued and like also you made sure that we were using evidence really clearly like that we were going back to the text to make sure that's where we brought our evidence so that was really cool thank you so much for working with us "
1345,310.1,Oliver,,"i love that student used the text when she found her answer ","No problem "
1349,150.1,Luis,,"so can you look a little deeper and try to answer that question ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1355,230.1,Luis,,"can you tell me more ","i watch a lot of sure sure i watch a lot of youtube videos so i know that astronauts need like um they need oxygen masks and often because there isn't any way to breathe there's no oxygen space and there's no gravity in space so they have to wear these really heavy boots to help them to walk on the moon um and then there's like a space shuttle that takes off but it has like two parts to it and one part falls off and then the other part like shoots them off into space "
1363,150.1,Jazmin,,"but can you look back in the reading and can you tell me it just the same way that you found out about the oxygen can you look back about the water and see what it says about that because i think if we use our brain just for a little bit and we read that reading you're going to have all those same answers about the water too ","okay Okay, because I don't understand why my answer is wrong. so i'll look and see "
1366,420.2,Jazmin,,"i just want you to get a little bit more specific with what you tell me ","okay "
1369,120.1,Chris,,"student did you find that answer in there ","yeah about the water "
1371,120.1,Chris,,,"yeah i did it's in paragraph 1 it talks about how the scientists found evidence that the water can be found in the crater to really dark craters "
1378,230.2,Oliver,,"so student did you find that answer in the in the text ","yeah yeah i when i looked on and to find the answer and i had circled the part that's the very last sentence of the whole text it says you'd need scientific to the tool called a microscope to really closely and because a microscope is a tool and like yeah like like a tool is like equipment you know so that's how i got it "
1381,130.2,Farrah,,"student would you agree with what student said ","yeah yeah cuz that that was the same i had circle too student i had circled like you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because they were looking at the water and that's what the question is asking "
1383,420.2,Jazmin,,"did you hear how they gave it a little bit more of a specific name so instead of just saying a small machine they called it a microscope ","no sorry i wasn't i was i was reading again i wasn't paying attention "
1385,420.2,Chris,,,"sorry to interrupt i just wanted to say that i know a lot i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
1388,110.3,Farrah,,"i'm sure they do and i bet that student could probably tell you more and you can share that information together ","yeah i can oh yeah sorry student was before student interrupted we were um i was trying to figure out like what was the problem with my answer too cuz i mean an equipment as a tool it's the same thing "
1393,310.1,Farrah,,"And that's perfectly because they're synonyms, which means that they're the same or they mean the same thing. ","great yeah exactly but then so so so what why is my answer wrong "
1397,110.2,Oliver,,"your answer is not wrong honey you're you're right ","oh oh okay well then why i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt um it's it's but i was i was looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just i really appreciate how how you like each of us question and and look again and you're also you're really a nice teacher thank you "
1403,210.2,Luis,,"do you know the difference or can you explain the difference between discovering and looking ","excuse me ms teache while she's thinking i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1407,210.2,Farrah,,"so when you discover something have you ever seen it before ","i guess like i'm when i discover on i was thinking more it's like when you find something i guess "
1410,230.2,Oliver,,"student you told me that you circled the same answer as student but i want you to challenge you and see if you can find in the text where it says or where it talks about a microscope because ","i circled it in the last paragraph but it was just hard student said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me well yeah it's the last the last sentence and the last paragraph "
1418,120.3,Jazmin,,"but i do want to challenge you to go back and would you actually read the the discussion question for me again ","what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Yeah, I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
1423,410.2,Jazmin,,"I asked Farrah over there who could go deeper into the text and find her answer, you should be able to pull it right from the text. So a small machine is great, but there's more specific information in there that could give a more specific answer. ","Okay. oh nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i just have to write the whole stuffer sentence "
1428,120.3,Luis,,"and i want to challenge just like student take a look at that question can you read the question for me ","um yeah okay um what scientists used to discover water on the moon "
1430,210.3,Luis,,"now did scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon ","well i mean no they didn't use them to discover water on the moon but they use oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon "
1434,130.2,Chris,,"So let's hop back to Chris for a second and see if he was able to find what answered, or the answer to this specific question. ","okay so i saw in the first paragraph where they're talking about the water and the water was found deep within the moon's polar craters um but then i remembered that you told student that finding isn't the same thing as discovering so now i'm not really sure you know "
1436,150.1,Chris,,"whoa okay so finding a finding and discovering are really similar words and i totally understand why we could get confused with them so that's okay student it's totally okay when you just ","i mean i know stuff about speaks to like student i went to nasa so i know that our scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks in suits but i just don't know which equipment they use to to to find the water or i guess discover water on the moon "
1439,120.3,Chris,,"i'm going to point you to paragraph three look at paragraph three ","uh huh "
1441,210.2,Jazmin,,"and remember we're looking for equipment ","but you said my answer is right my answers in paragraph two "
1444,120.4,Jazmin,,"student would you remind me of what you had told me before ","yeah i said the lunar orbiter because it says and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1446,410.2,Jazmin,,"Remember, we needed to be little bit more specific. ","look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
1449,230.2,Oliver,,"hmm so is that again we're coming back to what student had told us about look and discover and how that's a little confusing which verb are they using in that paragraph look or discover ","okay its got look and its got investigate miss victoria "
1451,230.2,Oliver,,,"i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so i'm sorry all but thanks for taking the time to work with us "
1453,220.1,Luis,,"hey class so i want to challenge you to think about the answer that you have right now and see if you can find evidence in the text that supports that answer student what's going on ","execuse me ms teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1456,120.3,Luis,,"can you read the discussion question for us again student ","sure um what scientists used to discover water on the moon "
1459,210.2,Luis,,"so we're discovering water on the moon ","i might use oxygen tanks to breathe "
1464,420.2,Farrah,,"Can you change or think about your answer and change the way that you say it, so it answers that question. ","whispering to herself you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
1470,120.3,Chris,,"can you read it out loud for me ","yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1473,110.2,Chris,,"So we're looking for equipment they definitely found craters full of water, ","Okay, okay. Yeah. "
1476,230.2,Farrah,,"student where in the reading you did you find some evidence to answer our question ","in the third paragraph oh ms teacher i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
1478,130.2,Oliver,,"let's see if we can figure it out because student had the same answer is you so let's talk with student and see if we can work together on that one ","yeah in paragraph three the last one it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1484,210.4,Oliver,,"did they discover water with the microscope ","did they discover well it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um so i guess they they looked at the water with the microscope "
1487,120.3,Jazmin,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what does it mean to investigate ","i watch sometimes umthis cartoon with a police dog and he's always investigating crimes "
1489,140.1,Jazmin,,"what what is he doing when he's investigating crimes does he does he just leave them unsolved at the end ","no no he goes around and he looks for clues and then he talks to people um yeah to kind of find it out "
1492,210.4,Jazmin,,"so they sent the orbiter to look for clues they didn't talk to class on the moon but they sent the lunar look for clues and what did they find with the lunar orbiter ","yeah um okay the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater nice ice deposits are very small st to set that one top of the top layer of the surface will in total 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
1495,210.3,Luis,,"student did you find any evidence when you were looking to answer that different question ","to two pieces of equipment the small machine that student was reading about and then the microscope that student and student were talking about "
1501,210.4,Jazmin,,"Jazmin remind me what investigating means again. ","look for clues "
1504,210.4,Farrah,,"they also had to see the water firsthand what did they use to see the water student ","the microscope the microscope "
1506,130.1,Chris,,"so wouldn't you say that they needed to use not one but two pieces of equipment to actually figure out that there was water on the moon ","you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits um so yeah it makes sense that they would need other equipment too "
1510,130.3,Oliver,,"yeah so they had to use the lunar orbiter and they also had to use the microscope ","miss miss teacher this is pretty cool i was just looking at the time and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i like how you kept asking me talk talk back after i'm at the tax to try to find that information because i know that i'm student and student know a lot of stuff but then you kept saying us okay well go read back in this part all read back in this part and i think about was helpful to "
1513,130.3,All,,,"okay bye bye "
1516,130.3,Bennett,,,"all right "
1518,130.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just was gonna say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space "
1520,110.3,Luis,,"you do that's wonderful well maybe you'll be able to help us answer our question a little bit differently so do you think you could put your listening ears on and maybe you can help us answer this question better does that sound okay ","oh yeah yeah i think i'd be great to help on this question "
1523,120.4,Farrah,,"so um i want to know from you all maybe each one of you can tell me something that you remember or that you found interesting about the reading so i'd like to start with student can you tell me something that you found interesting about the reading ","yeah so i think one thing that i thought was really interesting was when i was looking for the for the equipment but to see like how much equipment they have to use it there's a lot of it "
1526,120.4,Oliver,,"okay student what about you was there something interesting that stood out to you about the reading ","um yeah i think what was really interesting to me about this one was like the fact that there was just like you know the fact that there's so little water like it's all spread across the surface but they were still able to find it using the microscope "
1529,110.1,Chris,,"nice yes that was really interesting ","yeah i think for me what was most interesting was looking at like was i think the fact that i've not been to nasa a couple of times with my dad and so i was connecting to everything they were saying on because i i had kind of known some of it but not everything "
1532,120.4,Jazmin,,"hi student thank you for raising your hand would you like to share something interesting about the reading ","yeah i guess the thing that i had was that i was kind of confused about why my answer is wrong "
1534,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay well was there something else about the reading that you found interesting aside from the question itself ","okay a lot of it was just like what was really interesting is that like with water you could do like so much magic stuff plant and you do all kinds of stuff with water "
1537,120.4,Luis,,"all right student you said you knew a lot about science was there something interesting about this article that stood out to you ","hi yeah i was really cool and i think for me like the thing that was so interesting is like seeing that like you know how they use the equipment they have this equipment and then they have to use all these different pieces in order to like find the water and study it that's really cool "
1541,120.3,Oliver,,"okay student i saw your hand first will you read question number one for us please ","um yeah okay so question one is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1544,120.4,Farrah,,"okay i saw savannas hand first what do you think student ","I think the questions asking us, okay, so it says... Scientists discovered the water and then like what equipment did they use to do that. "
1547,120.4,Chris,,"student do you have something you'd like to add ","on class because i was just thinking that because i went to nasa and i just know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and that wasn't in the reading "
1549,230.1,Chris,,"you didn't find that in the reading is that what you said ","yeah like i know they use it but like it wasn't in the reading when i when i read i was wondering like should it have been there you know what i mean "
1552,210.3,Chris,,"so do you think student that if we're asking about the equipment that's used for water we would need all of the different equipment or only just the parts that would help us discover the water ","that's a really good question "
1554,110.1,Chris,,"yeah that was a big question ","you could use all of the equipment but like specifically you said to discover so i guess that's a like you don't use a suit to discover you'd have to use something else right "
1559,230.2,Chris,,"if you will refer back to your article back to your reading i would love to know where you think you might find the answer to the equipment that we use to discover water student i see your hand up yes ","and i would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water and i just want to say that i think it's important for me with the microscope but unfortunately we just have to go to lunch to wanted to thank you so much for working with us but but we have to go look "
1562,230.3,Farrah,,"okay so student just gave us an excellent answer she said that she thinks she can find the answer in paragraph two and then i heard from student he said he thought it was in paragraph three ","okay i'm sorry "
1565,230.2,Jazmin,,"so student could you please read us in paragraph to read us the sentence where you think it answers the question about what kind of equipment we were using to discover water ","in the first sentence in paragraph 2 it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1568,230.2,Farrah,,"wonderful okay student does student answer change the way that you would would answer or do you still believe it's in paragraph three ","well i guess i can see how the small machine or i guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like i could see how that was used to discover so the water you see is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close so i guess i guess what i was thinking is like you can't see the water without the microscope so like how could you discover it "
1570,130.2,Luis,,"okay that's a great question can class tell me what they think would be the answer to farrahs question which is wouldn't it be the microscope that discovered the water or can student support her answer with evidence that is the lunar orbiter okay student what do you think ","um yeah so what i was thinking just like on the question that you're asking is like you use lots of equipment and you don't need a microscope to to detect it you can detect water using other tools "
1572,110.1,Chris,,"okay i like that answer a lot and student would you like to add anything to that ","um yeah so i guess i wish to keep kind of the same thing that basically there's lots of equipment you you could use so like you don't the microscope isn't necessarily the quick you know what i mean like it could be sensors it could be other things "
1577,110.1,Jazmin,,"yes that's very true okay student what would you like to add ","he said that i support my answer right so okay yes here's how i would support my answer so the question was what equipment it scientists use to discover the water i was thinking that the word discovers like the word investigate so like it seemed like the best answer was like what was the word that matched the question right and even though you might use the microscope study the water like you use the lunar orbiter to discover the water "
1581,210.4,Farrah,,"Farrah, are you able to relate to what Jazmin was saying where the lunar orbiter is what we use to actually discover the water, but the microscope is what we use to study the water. ","yeah actually okay that does mean a lot of sense i still like i guess i'm not like 100 sure but i do understand like that that matches the word keyword "
1586,210.4,Luis,,"What we've talked about the lunar Lunar Orbiter and we've talked about the microscope. Was there any other equipment that they've talked about ","um well i guess okay you said what they talked about so not like what we were saying You know, I guess not. Like, there really isn't other. It's just a microscope and the lunar orbiter in the text. "
1597,150.1,Jazmin,,"what is the question asking us for please raise your hand if you think you know what the question is asking us ","we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to take a moment and i really wanted to thank you because there's a couple things that you were doing that like really helped us understand like the question and get to the answer first that you've really helped us to clarify like how you were asked like you know the ways that you asked us about our thinking and like what we were saying and like in order to like use evidence to justify our answers like you really gave us a chance to explain it and that was pretty cool because like we don't always get to like explain what we were thinking and also that you really value our thining even though it looks like lunar orbiter the right answer like you really valued what we were thinking about ans where they were coming from and i also you know like we're really beginning to ask us like you know like what we needed to work on and like we're giving ideas for how to improve it so like that was really cool to be able to begin that but especially to like be looking at all that stuff so thank you so much "
1599,120.1,Farrah,,"hi class so could i please hear a little bit more about the scientific tool like a microscope that you think you might need ","yeah sure okay so i had said that you know like you need this microscope in order to look really closely you know like at the water "
1601,110.1,Oliver,,"oh let's wait your turn please ","i said the same thing "
1603,210.3,Oliver,,"do you think ","sorry sorry "
1605,230.1,Farrah,,"do you think that they took a microscope with them to the moon ","i don't know but but it says tt says that they put they had a microscope in the story "
1609,230.1,Oliver,,"i like the connection you made there all right hey student can you tell me a little bit more why you like farrahs answer ","it's not that i liked her answer you know it's like like i had the same answer as her or like she had the same answer as me you know like we had the same answer but it doesn't like like i had her answer you know "
1612,110.1,Oliver,,"something about her answer that you really liked that you thought made sense ","well i mean yeah what i liked about you know like my answer um which student had the same one true um was that the question asked her about um let me see the question asked her about equipment and a microscope is like a tool you need a scientific tool yeah so like that's a tool and equipment is a tool so like that's why i think i think we had a good answer "
1616,230.1,Chris,,"can you tell me more about what you think about the craters full of water on the moon ","yeah yeah it was like okay so the scientists found found water in the crater so like that was my answer "
1621,230.2,Farrah,,"do you think that the moon is wet or did it say that the moon is very dry ","i don't know they found water deep in the craters they sent a machine to look for ice i don't know i don't know if it's wet or dry excuse me "
1623,230.2,Farrah,,,"i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
1626,130.2,Jazmin,,"student can you tell me or maybe how about with with student he's not sure if the moon is wet or dry can you maybe help him out and and see if you can give a different answer ","i don't know either if the moon is wet or dry "
1630,130.2,Luis,,"okay student are you able to help ","well i know i know a lot about space like and i know a lot about the moon like i know that the astronauts like to go to the moon and i know that you can't breathe there's no oxygen on the moon um and i know that um that so they have to wear like space suits so that they can breathe on the moon and then they can walk on the moon and i know that they found some water on mars but but i don't know if i don't know about the water on the moon yet "
1632,120.3,Farrah,,"okay can you can class look back at number three on your document so let's see student can you read the first sentence of bullet point number three on your document please just the first sentence ","oh yeah sure okay scientists have found evidence that water can be foudn deep within "
1635,120.3,Farrah,,"i'm gonna stop you there we're looking at number three not at number one can you try again ","oh yeah yes sorry okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
1638,230.1,Chris,,"thank you so much for reading so student did we discover that the moon is wet or dry ","yeah we know that the moon is dry okay i get it "
1640,230.2,Chris,,"so did they find craters full of water or were they just looking for the water to find ","see what you're saying okay okay yeah um well cuz you know i went to nasa and so i know that the scientists like they use a lot of like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff and so i didn't know that it was like really dry there "
1642,110.3,Chris,,"yeah that's great that's a great connection how neat that you've been to nasa before i love that ","it's really cool "
1645,120.3,Farrah,,"all right so student we're gonna stay on number three but i would like you to keep reading can you do that for me ","yeah sure sure sure okay um okay we're still in number three yeah oh cuz this is where my answer came from the water the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah that was my answer "
1648,110.2,Jazmin,,"they would probably need a microscope if they're going to test the water ","but then why is my answer wrong "
1651,120.4,Jazmin,,"i'm sorry student what was that ","then i don't know why my answer is wrong because i said a small machine and they asked about equipment "
1655,120.3,Jazmin,,"so student will you go to number two and read the first sentence on your document ","yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar to investigate orbiter "
1659,150.1,Luis,,"what does this small machine do and they go up on the moon ","excuse me maam "
1662,150.1,Luis,,,"i'm sorry yeah i know that was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i really i really do appreciate how you you took time with every every single one of us to kind of like you know help us to to keep looking looking at the text and and you're really patient thank you bye "
1667,150.1,Luis,,,"hi hi hi hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
1669,150.1,Luis,,"there's always things you can learn ","um oh i guess okay "
1673,150.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i think that's why that's why the teacher asked us to come over here for for you to talk to us about our answers yeah that's what they said um yeah yeah "
1675,120.2,Farrah,,"all right so student the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","uh huh "
1677,120.4,Farrah,,"do you remember put for that ","i'm i'm trying to remember i don't remember what i put let me just see because i circled it on my tablet oh yeah i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1680,110.1,Oliver,,"right ","yeah "
1682,120.4,Oliver,,"what did you put ","on well i circled the same thing as student on the bottom of the page we i didn't like circle it because she circled it but we had we had the same answer what i circled the same thing um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1684,120.4,Farrah,,"all right do you have anything else you want to add ","well i it's meet student here i just want to say that i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
1688,110.2,Farrah,,"i don't your answer isn't wrong ","but the teacher said that we're all here because we we needed to have a more complete response to the text and have a deeper understanding Okay. "
1693,110.2,Chris,,,"yeah yeah yeah ah i found that in the first part yeah and the first part of it cuz it talked to all about the water in the first part of it "
1698,110.2,Farrah,,"you class said they use the scientific tool called a microscope which that's answering the question right ","yeah that's why i it circled it says equipment you know like that's equipment on tool and equipment that's like the same thing yeah yeah cuz a microscope is a tool a scientific tool so that's equipment "
1702,120.2,Chris,,"right and then it says what equipment did the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","i went to nasa i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits a lot a lot of different equipment "
1704,210.1,Chris,,"right so they wouldn't you would need more than just a microscope to look at it right ","right yeah "
1706,210.3,Chris,,"right so that's why i was looking at jazmin's answer and she said nasa send a small machine and what else could she have put instead of just a small machine ","ah i'm not sure "
1708,120.1,Jazmin,,"student what else do you think ","me what do i think "
1710,210.3,Jazmin,,"well yeah what else could you have put in your answer instead of just saying a small machine how could you have made that more in depth answered it more in depth ","nasa sent a machine to discover water on the moon "
1712,120.4,Jazmin,,"i'm sorry say that one more time ","i guess put more of the question in my answer so i couldn't have said a small machine to discover water on the moon "
1714,210.3,Jazmin,,"bus a small machine that could be anything couldn't it ","yeah i guess so "
1716,120.3,Jazmin,,"so let's look back at paragraph two that first sentence ","okay "
1718,120.3,Jazmin,,"what does it say student ","it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1720,210.3,Jazmin,,"so what else could you put in your answer ","a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1725,150.1,Luis,,"you class see that ","i'm sorry i looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but i really appreciate you took so much time to really help us and ask us questions i must look back at the text again to try to find our answers um thank you "
1728,150.1,Farrah,,,"hi good how are you "
1730,150.1,Luis,,"i'm good so i brought you all back here into a small class because um i want to talk with you class about your answers that you class put for question number one yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer "
1732,120.4,Luis,,"um what what did you correct it to what did you write down again ","um well i didn't i already submitted it i don't remember what i wrote down um let me see if it's on my slide "
1734,110.1,Luis,,"i have written i have that you put scientist use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that what you put ","um no i corrected that let me see i'm looking to see if i can find it "
1739,420.1,Oliver,,"I want you guys to figure out or underline Or pick out one or two words in that question that you think our key words important words that might help us answer the question a little bit more in depth. Okay. ","i'm scared right now we're looking at keywords in the question "
1745,120.4,Farrah,,"and let's just see what you class got student did you find one ","i did and i already corrected my answer too but the keyword that i found was discover and equipment "
1749,130.2,Oliver,,"perfect yeah and how many of you class picked out equipment or discover ","i picked out equipment and discover too equipment and water i said equipment of water "
1751,130.2,Luis,,"student what did you get ","i said equipment discover and water "
1755,110.1,Oliver,,"so i'm student what i have that you have written down as you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really to look at it really close ","yeah yeah when you asked us all a say or answer so first i'm not i heard hurts and it's the same thing that i found too "
1760,230.1,Farrah,,"why did you write down the answer that you did ","well because i was looking at the word equipment and i remembered in science class miss smith always calls a microscope equipment when she says we're going to use the equipment today and also for discover i think that's like you know when you're looking at something you discover it and so i saw that they were talking about finding the water and looking at it in paragraph three and the microscope which is "
1762,230.1,Oliver,,"ok and student why did you why did you put down the same thing in student was your mind going the same way as hers ","oh well kinda cuz yeah i'm in the same science classes her so when it said scientific tool i was thinking about how we use tools for different things and so i thought equipment and tool was the same thing so that's why i set the microscope "
1764,210.2,Oliver,,"good okay well equipment is the same thing as a tool right but we're trying to figure out the equipment that they used to discover and do you class know what discover means ","it means like when you find something "
1768,120.1,Oliver,,"so student and student while i'm talking with student and student and student i want you to to look back in the passage and see if you can find a different equipment that they used can you gues do that ","uh huh "
1770,110.1,Chris,,"okay and i'm going to talk with student and student and student ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mask and suits "
1774,110.1,Jazmin,,"student in your answer i saw you that you put nasa sentma small machine ","uh huh okay um "
1778,210.4,Jazmin,,"and you are exactly right they did send a small machine but do you know what that small machine was called ","no i don't remember Oh, oh, it's called a lunar orbiter. "
1782,150.1,Oliver,,"and i want you to keep that in your mind just a minute okay ","excuse me it's i'm sorry it's been a short time but it's time for us to go to lunch now "
1784,150.1,Oliver,,,"thank you okay bye "
1789,230.1,Luis,,"i saw where student where you revised your answer what made you change your mind what made you change your answer ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer and so i know mind correct now "
1795,230.1,Farrah,,"so student what made you change your answer ","you had told me before that that the microscope looked at the the the water but but it didn't discover the water so then i was trying to find another machine in the story "
1798,120.4,Oliver,,"all right um and then student did you get the chance to revise yours ","oh i couldn't figure out what was wrong because i thought the microscope was right "
1802,230.1,Chris,,"okay student and you revised you're in so you put that the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic and we talked a little bit about that what made you change to change your answer ","when it said that the water was deep in the craters that that meant was like a poll that was really deep in there was a lot of water but then you had told me that deep in the craters didn't mean like like like a pool but just made like really low so and and i realized there wasn't any equipment in in paragraph one okay "
1806,210.2,Farrah,,"so i want us to look at the question and it said the question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so we're trying to figure out what equipment so what what sort of tool did scientists to use to find the water on the moon ","oh nevermind i didn't realize you were you were gonna read that part nevermind "
1808,210.2,Jazmin,,,"i changed my answer too "
1810,230.1,Jazmin,,"what did you change your answer to ","i added the name of the machine i said nasa some to small machine called a lunar orbiter "
1812,230.2,Jazmin,,"perfect and student where did you um can you tell me what paragraph you found that in ","it was in the same sentence as the one that i i had my my first answer in paragraph to um but i just added the name of the machine "
1816,230.3,Luis,,"correct ","Okay. "
1818,150.1,Luis,,"does that make sense ","yeah i'm not sure it's just that i didn't say enough "
1821,130.2,Chris,,"your answer was that scientists found i see using smaller machines but class did we know that ice is water right q ","yeah for for me that's why i was i was confused because i was looking for water in the story and so i didn't see the pardon about paragraph two about the ice cuz i was looking for the word water "
1824,210.4,Chris,,"so whenever we're looking in our passage we have to be able to read and understand that ice on the moon is the same thing as water ","you know teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like tanks and masks and suits "
1826,110.1,Chris,,"yeah nasa does have ","yeah um but i didn't i didn't know anything about the water "
1828,230.1,Chris,,"you didn't know anything about the water so you didn't know that water meant the same thing as ice ","well i mean i remember we learned that in science class but i wasn't thinking about it i was thinking more about like the just water water you know when i was reading i was looking for the word "
1832,520.1,Oliver,,"okay so whenever we're reading we want to fully understand what we're trying to look for in the question so as we're reading if we're not sure we need to be able to understand what the question is asking ","reach every reader thank you it's time for us to go to lunch must go but thank you for for all i guess it's telling us what we're looking for question to really try to understand what it's asking and not just look up the keywords because i guess that's what me and student and student detlef look at some keywords but we didn't really understand "
1836,520.1,Chris,,,"okay thank you okay bye hi "
1840,120.4,Luis,,"student would you remind me of your answer again ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about speed "
1842,110.1,Luis,,"thank you for your input student but i just asked student a question would you mind letting her respond ","oh yeah sure "
1844,110.1,Farrah,,,"can you repeat the question please "
1846,120.2,Farrah,,"yes what equipment then scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh yeah um so i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
1849,120.3,Oliver,,"now student can you read the first sentence in paragraph two for me ","oh yeah sure okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
1853,120.3,Chris,,"let's see student could you read the second sentence in that paragraph paragraph number two ","yeah sure this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
1856,120.3,Jazmin,,"and student would you read that last sentence and paragraph number two for us please ","yeah sure these ice deposits are very small "
1859,150.1,Luis,,"very good so i had you read paragraph number two because it's really where our answer is ","i'm not really sure "
1862,140.1,Luis,,"could you tell me some equipment that they took up there that they used in general while they were in space ","oh yeah i know a lot about that equipment um they they use okay so because there's no oxygen in space they use like oxygen tanks and they use like i'm their space suits and they use a rocket like to get up into space you know like as a rocket goes straight up like all way into the way into the orbit of space "
1865,150.1,Jazmin,,"so let's look let's start at the top then let's start at the very top the moon is a desert right ","excuse me but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
1867,120.4,Jazmin,,"i'm sorry i couldn't hear you can you repeat that ","i don't understand why is my answer is wrong "
1869,110.2,Jazmin,,"your answer is not wrong so you you're right they did say that they used a microscope to look very closely okay you're right about that ","that was farrah's answer mine was about the small machine i thought that that was be the right answer "
1872,210.3,Jazmin,,"do you know what the small machine was called ","lunar orbiter "
1874,110.1,Jazmin,,"there you go very good that is correct so that is the answer that we're looking for student thank you ","i'm sorry what's the answer "
1879,210.4,Chris,,"and the lunar orbiter in paragraph two it says it looks for ice deposits in large polar craters the ice deposits are very small so do you see how that is our answer does that help student ","well i know the answer cuz cuz you just told me it is but um i guess i don't know i mean i went to nasa and i know that there's lots of equipment and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and like lots lots of stuff like that lots of equipment because i'm using the word in the question lots of equipment like that "
1883,120.2,Chris,,"but this question specifically asking which piece of equipment helped them find water does that help ","yeah i think you're saying like that yeah so i know a lot of equipment but the question is asking about the equipment that we use to find a water so i was just talking about equipment but not equipment to find the water "
1886,210.4,Oliver,,"so let's look back in the text so where in the text can you find the word machine ","yeah cuz student answer had machine in it but my answer and um farrahs answer well our answer had a scientific tool and and and scientific tool is is equipment too "
1889,150.1,Oliver,,"very good so what did we what did we look at and very closely ","i'm i'm i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to a lunch i know it was really really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to like listen to all of us and really try to help us take our time to find the answer right class okay so thank you and bye "
1892,150.1,Luis,,"hi class thank you so much for your responses taking your time and reading the text and rotten a response yes student ","um yeah so i i think i need to be in this class because i know all about space "
1898,120.4,Farrah,,"so who can raise their hand and tell me what equipment ","okay so i said basically it would be a scientific tool called a microscope "
1901,130.1,Farrah,,"and and that is an equipment a microscope is a piece of scientific equipment you are correct ","they're looking for the water "
1904,110.1,Oliver,,"and i think student you had said the same thing is student right ","Yeah, I said the same thing. "
1908,120.1,Farrah,,"Okay, perfect. So how about you two kind of work together and go back and look at the text and look specifically for what piece of equipment they used to look for. ","water "
1912,150.1,Chris,,"let's look at that did you have questions let's see ","um so i said that scientists found craters full of water "
1918,110.4,Jazmin,,"so let's look there they did find water on the moon that is correct yeah you student ","i'm still looking like why my answer is wrong "
1920,430.2,Jazmin,,"so your answer they did send a small machine but the question was asking for specifics so a little more in depth so could you be a little more specific about what type of equipment and what that piece of equipment's name was ","it was the lunar orbiter "
1924,420.2,Chris,,"you just needed to go just a little bit more in depth right ","um well i i don't really know which equipment it might be because i just i think there's a lot of craters there's a lots of water "
1929,130.2,Luis,,"how about you and student kind of work together and look back at the tix to maybe you class can help each other look at the text ","while i was just gonna say like i know that like scientists use a lot of you know equipment so like i said oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
1932,130.1,Luis,,"yeah and that's right they do use that ","um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1935,130.1,Luis,,"awesome okay so yeah they would have used that equipment they would have to use oxygen if they're on the moon if it were astronauts on the moon right ","Well, I saw on you know Orbiter and microscopes that was the equipment. I saw like in the reading. "
1939,210.4,Luis,,"right exactly so do you think they use a microscope to help them look for water while they're physically on the moon ","um yeah i didn't really think about it because i haven't really read about microscopes before i'm not totally sure like did they use that like which one they use "
1942,210.4,Chris,,"And microscopes, it has both of them there that but when it's talking specifically about finding water. See if you can look back in the texts and find where it says film equipment used to find water on the moon. Yeah. Chris. ","so we were talking and i was saying oh so like i was saying i know that like because i went to nasa with my dad so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i really think that's the answer "
1948,120.3,Chris,,"and then in the second paragraph right there if you could go back and reread that second paragraph for me ","to read aloud "
1951,120.3,Jazmin,,,"okay i'm reading it right now well chris's meeting unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go it just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
1953,150.1,Luis,,"hey class thanks so much for reading that text and responding rotten those responses for me yes student ","um yeah so i've kind of already like i know all about space so i don't think i really even the be in this class "
1956,110.3,Chris,,"awesome student well thanks so much for joining us we we really need you in this class today since you know a lot about space okay thank you for that ","oh no i was just "
1959,150.1,Farrah,,"okay awesome so let's take a quick look at our responses ","yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
1963,110.1,Luis,,"you said that they use lots of equipment right ","yeah "
1965,230.1,Luis,,"can you list off some equipment that they used ","yeah okay so they use like they use oxygen tanks and they use masks and like they must have us rocket fuel and like rocket ships and all that kind of stuff you know "
1971,120.3,Luis,,"how about student would you go back and read paragraph two for us would you read it aloud place ","Okay. Um, let's see. okay nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar or will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a barge pole or create these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 30 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
1974,110.1,Farrah,,"very good student thank you for reading that again for us ","just wondering i'm still confused why my answer is wrong "
1979,210.2,Farrah,,"they're looking for specific piece of equipment ","He was looking for microscopes. "
1983,150.1,Oliver,,"i think you may still be confused student right ","yeah i have that same answer "
1995,410.2,Chris,,"so all those facts are right that you class had but they're wanting a little more specific answer okay ","so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like you know scientists use like oh suits masks like stuff like that so i was thinking maybe that was part of the answer "
2001,110.3,Luis,,"now student our science expert ","yeah "
2005,120.3,Luis,,"so let's look at the question again student we read it to me one more time ","Yeah. Um, okay, so what equipment Did scientists use discover water on the moon. "
2008,420.3,Luis,,"So if you look back in paragraph two, what does it tell you about the piece of equipment they use, what's it called? ","wow let's see only equipment in paragraph two is the lunar orbiter "
2010,110.4,Luis,,"Right. That is exactly right. ","um it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then it says like it'll land at the moon south pole look ice deposits so is the lunar orbiter the right answer "
2013,530.1,Luis,,"exactly student so how's your thinking changed since the very beginning ","i'm not totally sure i that i'm like looking at the paper it says that it's like the lunar orbiter is in paragraph two but i guess not totally sure why that's the answer "
2017,530.1,Chris,,,"fortunately all happy to watch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us in particular and really wanted to just like taking the time to help us understand the question and make sure that we were reviewing like that and then you're asking us to make sure that we really like you know like we really thought about our eater so thank you so much for working with us it was hi "
2019,530.1,Chris,,,"hi the teacher said that you were going to give us some feedback on our our answers to the question "
2021,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me "
2023,530.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
2025,230.3,Luis,,"you think that you know everything about space you don't have to learn everything more ","well i mean not like everything but i know a lot a lot a lot about space "
2028,110.3,Luis,,"okay but maybe there is something that you don't know and you would like to learn or you will be grateful after the class to learn that thing ","yeah i think yeah i think that makes sense okay yeah okay "
2030,130.1,Oliver,,"okay i read all of your answers and i think that you have very good points class but you have to think a little bit more about what is the question about for example the question is what let me see the question again ","i can read the question if you want me to "
2032,120.2,Oliver,,"okay please can you please read the question again ","what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2035,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so you have to think a little bit more about these questions because it says two words that are essential for your answer and one of the words is equipment and one of the words is water so you have to think about these two words before you try to make an answer ","On. Yeah, I was. I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water. So I have both of those. So I don't know why my answers wrong. "
2038,220.1,Farrah,,"but i need to do with every one of your classmate right now to explain them why they need to look for another answer okay ","um okay "
2040,130.1,Jazmin,,"student says that nasa sent a small machine and that was right too but that was not enough for that question they sent a small machine but you have to look for a better word to answer that question ","a better word "
2042,130.3,Jazmin,,"a better word like microscope because the reading says that they need a microscope to find water on the moon ","i don't understand because it says oh what did they use to discover the water and so in paragraph two they talk all about like looking for the ice deposits and we we learned in science class that ice and water are the same thing ice is just frozen water right "
2044,130.3,Jazmin,,"mm hmm yes and the small machine i think that you wanted to say that that is small machine is a microscope right ","okay let me see "
2047,120.1,Jazmin,,"number three read again number three the paragraph number ","number three okay i'm not really sure i don't know "
2050,120.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
2052,120.1,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that they use the scientists use a lot of equipments like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of equipment like that "
2054,110.3,Chris,,"oh you were there ","yeah i went with my dad and we saw the rocket ships and we saw with all kinds of cool stuff "
2057,110.3,Chris,,"that is really cool maybe you should tell us about in another class about everything that you did see there ","okay okay cool yeah i can tell you all all about how the space ships take off and like how you know it's a little bit hard people think they're they're covered in like i'm like just the same kind of metal as an airplane but they have to have thermal tiles on them and that when they go like way up into the orbit you know it gets really really hot so the type of aluminum that's on the spaceship it protects it "
2059,110.3,Chris,,"wow that seems really awesome ","yeah "
2063,120.2,All,,"and student you can you please read the question again ","yeah sure the question is what equipment did scientistis use to discover water on the moon oh excuse me student i i'm sorry to interrupt i was i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you listen to everybody's ideas and what they had to say well i hope that we see you again bye "
2065,120.2,Chris,,,"hi glad to see you "
2068,120.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna share that i already kind of know all about space i don't really even need to be in this class you know what i mean "
2071,130.2,Jazmin,,"what do you think student what do you feel about what student said ","um well i think yeah like he knows a lot about space and she knows a lot about stuff so student then you should just like even i mean you should just share with us what you think like your background "
2074,120.4,Chris,,"student what do you think about the reading was it informative for you ","well i think it was informative because i realized that there was all this water in all these craters on the moon like it sounds like there's overflowing water "
2080,120.4,Oliver,,"was it interesting for you ","well that's a great question i think what was interesting was mostly the fact that i'm like well i guess if you think it's like i thought it was interesting like the article that they talked about like you know what i mean like these different things that you eventually do on the moon and it made me think about like wanting to be like maybe i want to be an astronaut like luis's dad "
2083,110.3,Luis,,"student your dad is an astronaut that's why you know a lot about space ","yeah i know all about it "
2086,120.4,Luis,,"will you like to do that student ","um yeah like there's a few things that i should are that i've learned from like i learned that like well like you have to use all this equipment and stuff like that "
2089,120.4,Farrah,,"student what do you think about the article that you learn something with the article today ","yeah i learned about how you use microscopes different ways i think that the thing i want you to the question i have is like why my answer is wrong "
2094,120.4,Oliver,,"Oliver. Thanks for raising your hands there. ","um yeah so i thought the equipment i think that the microscope i agree with student "
2096,110.1,Farrah,,"good and student ","yeah i think microscope as well and it sounds like yeah i think i and i can prove it from the reading "
2099,110.1,Chris,,"okay thank you yeah that's a really good question and answer ","well okay so one thing that i noticed is i been to nasa with my dad and i love space and i noticed that the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean so i was wondering if they use that for this too "
2103,120.4,Jazmin,,"what do you think student what equipment did they use ","i am convinced that they used the lunar orbiter and i think that that's like because that's the small machine that they set and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go too much i just wanted to thank you for working with us so much and i think we'll see you again so thank you so much bye "
2106,120.4,Oliver,,,"we're good we're excited to see you "
2108,120.4,Luis,,,"um yeah i was just gonna say that like i already know all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to even be "
2113,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so student what equipment do you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon ","oh so i think it's the microscope "
2115,110.1,Farrah,,"microscope ","yeah because you need it look really closely "
2118,110.2,Farrah,,"very good that's a very good answer ","good question he said in the reading that paragraph three that the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you will look straight at it so you have to use a microscope want to see it "
2121,140.1,Farrah,,"have you ever seen something through a microscope ","yeah "
2125,140.1,Farrah,,"yes what thing that you see ","we plant cells in science class Yeah. "
2128,120.4,Oliver,,"student what was your answer ","um so my answer was basically that i had i you know i circled the same thing as as student and i think the same thing that the microscope was was what they used to discover "
2132,120.1,Oliver,,"okay do you have something to add to farrah's answer ","i'm not sure like what would i add Oh, well, yeah, I think the same reason like cuz they said it in the in the reading. They were like, You have to. Yeah. Like Farrah said you have to use like a microscope to see them microscopic particles "
2135,110.1,Jazmin,,"good good answer thank you ","i wasn't sure like why my answer was wrong "
2139,120.1,Jazmin,,"What do you think this Jazmin? ","like what is the machine "
2141,120.1,Jazmin,,"uh huh that they used to discover water on the moon ","small machine is it's called a lunar orbiter "
2143,120.1,Jazmin,,,"sorry the machine is called a lunar orbiter "
2148,120.1,Jazmin,,"but what did they use to find actually water on the moon ","well i was wondering because when i think about it i think it you know they use the lunar orbiter and they don't really talk about like having class on board they had to use some kind of tool so i guess they could they have used it seems like they use the lunar orbiter the to find the water in your enemy and then they studied with the microscope "
2151,110.1,Chris,,"student you said that scientists found craters full of water on them on linkedin that that is a good answer to the question what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ","i don't know is it not a good answer "
2157,120.1,Chris,,"yes that is an answer but if the question says what equipment did they used to discover what water on the moon what do you think that should be a good answer to that question ","Oh, I guess, like, I guess I would have to say a piece of equipment. right like not is that one my answer was what okay so what i was gonna say is that basically you know like i went to nasa with my dad and when we when we saw that scientists use masks and oxygen tanks and stuff and i was thinking that was missing fromt he reading "
2164,110.2,Oliver,,"yes and yes and actually they use oxygen and all the things that you say to be there in the moon to discover water so yes that's something really good to add student thank you student ","um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and thank you so much for working with us and like in particular it was really cool how you asked us to connect like our our responses to like our experiences and like share with you what we thought about them beyond just our answers and that was really cool because it helped us to both like clarify what we were kind of thinking a little bit and then also was like helping us to think about like what kind of evidence like maybe we should do so like i think class by like talking to class you asked class like you know what i mean like who should like who should talk and like you can share and that was really cool well thank you so much for that "
2166,110.2,Chris,,,"hi "
2169,110.2,Oliver,,,"hi mister a hi mister a "
2172,220.1,Luis,,"and i wanted to kind of dive into these here i want to make sure we're all on the same page and kind of understanding that test to text to its full extent oh yes student ","excuse me um but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
2177,120.4,Luis,,"you know all about space let's see so even if i remember correctly you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ","Um, i okay well i have to look back and see um i'm not really sure i'm come back to me because now i gotta read it and i gotta look look for "
2184,210.2,Oliver,,"let's say, you know, the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on Mars. ","microscope that was that was my answer it was the same one i savannas but like it's only cuz you asked her first if you would have asked me first then maybe student would have said i have the same answer as student right yeah so it's the microscope "
2187,110.2,Oliver,,"and i see it's the microscope very good very good um are there any other equipment you noticed in there other than the microscope ","um i'm not sure um i have to read it through again okay i see something in paragraph two "
2189,110.4,Luis,,"that's right ","yeah right i see that too i see that too "
2191,210.4,Jazmin,,"very good very good i'm glad you're seeing it so let's take a look back student noticed paragraph two could have some insight for us so let's look back and see what sort of equipment do we see mentioned specifically in paragraph two ","mister a my answer came from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2195,150.1,Jazmin,,"in fact you kind of took a took some some liberties that were there so we have to think um why might that not be hitting right where we needed to ","Well as sentences NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that this specific machine is the Lunar Orbiter. "
2198,430.2,Jazmin,,"that's very good that's very good so right both a small machine and a lunar orbiter would be correct but if i was only reading the answers to this specific question i might not have the context needed to know that so by saying lunar orbiter instead of a small machine you allow whoever read that response to know exactly what you're talking about ","oh ok ok i think i think i understand that "
2202,120.1,Luis,,"let's see student um we gave you a little bit of time did you have a chance to look back over would you like more time ","oh no i read the whole thing i was gonna say the same thing that student said like when you're asked me to look for equipment i found two pieces of equipment the lunar orbiter but also the microscope that that student was talking about "
2207,110.2,Chris,,"um and that was an important part of this so very good job in identifying kind of like the main idea of the article we're reading it's just the question might have been not necessarily trying to hit there so student talk ","yeah well i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit stuff "
2209,140.1,Chris,,"that's really good well it sounds exciting did you enjoy yourself and nasa ","yeah oh yeah me and my dad we when we saw like all of these different space shuttles and all of these like different astronauts suits it was the coolest ever "
2211,110.1,Chris,,"that's wonderful student and i'm really glad to hear you had a good time there and i can tell that you've got some background knowledge just like student had there and ","yeah "
2217,150.1,h,,"so you kind of see where we went wrong ","um yeah you said that i was right on when i was talking about the water but i didn't talk about the equipment right "
2222,410.2,Oliver,,"but it's still wrong and it doesn't really tell us what the question is trying to get at we want to know about this equipment so we have to make sure we talk about the equipment specifically ","okay okay yeah i just want to say i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch i know this has been really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you really took the time to really help us look at all the different words in the question and the words and the answer and give class like some positive feedback that seemed really nice thank you "
2224,410.2,All,,,"bye "
2226,410.2,All,,,"good morning good morning "
2228,410.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
2230,110.3,Luis,,"good well even i'm happy to hear that you sound confident in your knowledge there and a lot of us here do have a lot of good knowledge to share so being in this class doesn't mean you don't necessarily know about it maybe you're going to be helping your classmates learn about ","how okay "
2235,230.1,Farrah,,"what your what your answer was and sort of how you got there so i'd like to start with student so let's hear your answer and how do you think you got to that answer ","so i said i'm you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i got their cars that was a piece of equipment and they were talking about looking at what "
2238,130.2,Oliver,,"um to kind of build off that student could you remind me of what the question was what question are we answering here ","yeah sure okay the question was whatequipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2241,120.4,Oliver,,"absolutely very good thank you and so what was your response to this ","well i mean i had that same as student because i circled the last what she thought was the last sentence and i i circled the last sentence do you need assigned a tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2244,420.2,Oliver,,"so if we were able to come to that same sort of answer but give more details you might be able to better inform your reader who's me the teacher ","oh yeah yeah yeah i can see that "
2246,150.1,Farrah,,"thank you so that's good that's an area we can improve and like i said i appreciate your analysis there so student what was the oh pardon me student student yes question ","yeah i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
2250,410.2,Farrah,,"If we're looking at the the story as a whole, we see that we're talking a lot about space and a lot about the moon, do you think your answer invoke some ideas of the moon or invokes ideas of space. ","um okay yeah cause i know we're supposed to pull something out of the story and they talk about the microscope and they talk about looking at water really closely on the moon so yeah "
2255,410.2,Farrah,,"So we got to make sure that when we're answering. We try to include some some things like that to let us know to let whoever our reader is of our answers kind of clue in to where we were. ","okay "
2258,120.4,Chris,,"thank you for that understanding today so student i'd like to hear your response ","well i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits went to nasa "
2263,120.4,Chris,,"so uh and i'm so sorry student i might have dismiss heard you could you repeat your response for me word for word just an i make sure i ","oh yeah sorry i've never actually i didn't see it on so i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon "
2266,430.2,Chris,,"Kind of letting our reader who is answer reading our sort of responses here, kind of get a better idea of what's talking about there. So in the article. Did they find a whole lot of water on the moon, or was it closer to a little bit of water. ","oh i thought it was a lot of water "
2270,210.2,Chris,,"I'm glad we're able to see that. But then we also have to remember right, we're looking for equipment, we're looking for, you know, these mechanisms that help us get there because that's what the questions answering. Right. Can you remind me what the question says, ","what equipment all yeah okay what equipment scientists use to discover water on them yeah "
2276,530.1,Oliver,,"so how can we approach that question a little differently now that you've looked at it ","i guess they used o equipment well i don't know i don't know what the what the equipment is that they use Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later. "
2282,530.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
2287,210.3,Luis,,"improvement and tell me what changes did you make ","okay so um i heard that you when you're talking to student and student and you're asking them to think about the idea of the story so i took out the oxygen tanks and i just had that scientists use a lot of equipment on the mode "
2293,420.2,Luis,,"i think we can be a little more specific in your response so you said oxygen tanks and yeah absolutely they're gonna use oxygen tanks there could you tell me maybe another piece of equipment that nasa used in this article to help discover water on the moon ","okay um well um i know it's not the microscope because you already told them that they were wrong so i'm the only other one that i see only in the first three paragraphs right we're only looking at the beginning part of the article "
2295,420.2,Luis,,,"okay um so the only other thing that i can see as the lunar orbiter "
2298,110.4,Jazmin,,"absolutely absolutely i think a lunar orbiter is really key here right they can't get any of their equipment up to the moon without that sort of orbiter right ","well i'm still confused i am yeah "
2302,230.1,Jazmin,,"that's okay student absolutely you can you could give me one moment student talk to me about why you're confused what's going on ","the answer i mean i use i said i'm not too small machine but i'm in this class so why is my answer Yeah. Yeah, you did. "
2306,210.3,Jazmin,,"um depending on size could a lunar order maybe also be a small machine ","yeah yeah i think that fast the probably the one that i was talking about i guess ah so what i think we could do to improve is maybe make your answer be a little more specific so that way when i read it i know exactly which piece of equipment you're talking about i don't have to leave things to be ambiguous does that make sense yeah so i just i just got to add the name that i sent a small machine called lunar orbiter okay "
2312,210.2,Luis,,"but the way they use equipment here means it could be plural it could be more than one so maybe a good response could be talking about you know including multiple ones that we read about it there ","um yeah so i felt like that's what i did i took off the oxygen tanks and so i said a lot of equipment so that it would include more than one but you said that's not i wasn't i wasn't right "
2319,410.2,Luis,,"something that's right on the cusp of being just what i'm looking for in this case student was a little too vague ","Okay, so I just got to add the names like how Jazmin did a lot of equipment like arbiters and microscopes i think i think that "
2326,130.3,Luis,,"and the lunar orbiter right we could say they use the lunar orbiter to reach the moon and a microscope to find the water there specifically those kinds of things let our reader or the person that's looking at our answers know exactly what we're we mean ","Oh man, that's like a lot of words, you're saying we got to write all that down. "
2328,420.2,Chris,,"a lot of words can seem tough but making sure that your reader knows exactly what you are saying can go a long way that way you don't get any confusion so they know you're just as smart as i know you are ","you know i've heard that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
2339,210.3,Farrah,,"just to kind of circle back a little bit i think a student now that we've kind of talked to some other people in the class there how do you feel about your answer if you were giving it another shot at it what might you say instead ","okay um so like you told student and student that they had to have more more more details and that there's two answers so um but then like even more details about the question who okay um so i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close on so if i was going to say ah i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope or a lunar orbiter to look really closely i'm not sure "
2344,410.2,Farrah,,"We're not necessarily letting somebody know hey if you're looking for water on the moon. This is how you go about doing it. We're talking about someone that's already done. We're talking about NASA specifically right ","Oh hey, why would we change it to start with NASA "
2352,420.2,Oliver,,"right we kind of want to let our readers know that we're talking about the scientist specifically so you could say nasa or you could say scientist used if you want to do either one of those i think would convey your meeting ","okay okay that's good i think okay i'll try it out um okay scientists use a microscope ah lunar orbiter talk really closely "
2357,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","class you know i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch "
2361,150.1,Oliver,,,"thank you but mr obama had a whole i wanted to say but i was less than i and i i really appreciate how you you help us keep thinking about the evidence from the text and and putting the details from the question and our answer i feel like that's something i can do next time ma'am it's still hard i don't i couldn't figure out how to do it but i mean i guess like i know that's what i'm supposed to do "
2363,150.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye see you next time "
2366,150.1,Unclear,,,"hi "
2369,230.1,Farrah,,"what were you looking for ","um so i was saying like that you can use a microscope to see the water "
2372,230.2,Farrah,,"so you just provided the i'm gonna use a microscope to look really closely so but what are you looking closely for good job though ","um well like you are looking closely for the water like the astronauts would have to use a microscope to like look at the ice crystals that make up the water "
2375,210.3,Luis,,"perfect now what was the microscope attached to ","i'm not totally sure i know i know i know i know i know "
2377,210.3,Luis,,,"alright so here's the thing so um i don't think i should be with this class because i had i always get my answers right like when i'm when i'm talking about space because i know all about space already so i don't even have to be here "
2379,130.2,Luis,,"oh well i'll see here student and i appreciate your feedback but what was the microscope attached to help student out ","well i guess i didn't really read that part because i didn't think i had to read the part cuz i already know man "
2381,130.2,Oliver,,"well i mean won't you go back and reread it and help savannnah out and student what do you think you said you circled the same answer as student so what was the microscope attached to how did they find the water in the crater ","was um was a microscope attached to like to the astronaut "
2383,130.2,Chris,,"not really but that's a good guess student what do you got ","um so i guess like i kind of know a lot about nasa and i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and like you know like masks and suits and stuff so i don't know i think that oliver's guess is pretty good like you could look and say like the microscopes on like like what if you attached it to the hand of the spacesuit "
2385,130.2,Jazmin,,"okay i'm one of these are really good guesses but we're still missing the point student i'm calling on you what do you got ","what i said was it it was a small machine "
2387,110.2,Jazmin,,"a small machine right perfect what is that small machine called ","well i guess if i look at it like it says like the lunar orbiter right that they sent up in space "
2389,110.4,Farrah,,"that is correct you did very well it's the lunar orbiter that's how they actually examine the water and the craters yes student ","um so what i'm confused though is is my answer wrong or is jazmin's answer wrong i said the microscope and student said the lunar orbiter "
2393,110.2,Jazmin,,"So you're both right. So, which is a good thing. That's great about working in groups. We all participate and contribute ","so am i like more right because i was saying about the orbiter and like student is like sort of right but you know i'm like wondering "
2400,110.2,Jazmin,,"right here where you couldn't because you wouldn't have the ability to look closely and student good couldn't get it up to the moon without yours so you're both right you just didn't have the ","i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go but i just wanted to say to you because i know we just met you but i wanted to thank you because you were really warm and positive with us and the thing is is like sometimes we like really drive science teacher crazy and like i feel like you were so patient with us and you've really listened to our answers and you really helped us to like hear each other's answers because we don't always pay attention to like each other so i just wanted to say thank you "
2403,110.2,Luis,,,"i'm okay i'm good "
2405,110.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be on this class i already know all about space "
2408,150.1,Luis,,"so hey class reason i brought you together is i was looking at your answers these questions on this text we just read and i just wanted to maybe help you out with some stuff that's okay ","i guess i'll "
2412,120.4,Farrah,,"so student let's start with you what was your answer to the question number one ","okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2416,120.1,Farrah,,"what is the question actually ask us ","oh the question says what equipment to scientists use to discover water on the moon right so if we look at the passage we need to start comprehend here here's what and this goes to all you class right so i'm going to give you a really quick reading strategy to help you out all right "
2427,510.1,Farrah,,"And then you go look at your question and you look at what it's really asking you, and then you've read it again. Right. So it's three steps skim it read it fast go look at the question and then you read to find the answer to that question. Does that make sense. ","yeah right i did it Okay. um but i mean i got my answer right from the text do you see in paragraph three the last sentence you you that's where it got it okay i circled that "
2430,120.2,Farrah,,"did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2434,230.1,Farrah,,"well let's look at what made you think of that ","cuz cuz in science class the teachers always like okay we're going to use microscopes today let's get off the equipment and so so i know that microscopes or equipment on and then the question asks about discovering the water and in in this paragraph it says that you'd need this to look at the water so "
2438,120.4,Farrah,,"ah say that statement one more time ","oh you need this to look at the water "
2442,210.2,Farrah,,"keyword there is look in the question asked you to see what you need to look at the water ","oh oh no it is to "
2444,210.4,Farrah,,"Once you take a quick glance at it. ","okay "
2447,150.1,Oliver,,"you circle the same as savannas does that help you any ","well okay so yeah cuz i i i kind of had the same thinking i said man i was like okay a scientific tool is equipment on the water okay but yeah i see what you're saying about looking it's not the same as discovering okay "
2450,110.1,Chris,,"okay all right so student what's up man how are you ","yeah i'm feeling good i know a lot about this stuff "
2455,110.2,Chris,,"Well, good. I liked your answers. Scientists found craters full of water on the moon. So they did using what they, ","oh well i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits Oh, text "
2458,420.2,Farrah,,"yeah so remember that's what we're trying to get the information pro is what ring correct ","yeah right right okay oh okay mister mister fortune i see on there's a small machine one in paragraph to "
2461,210.4,Oliver,,"that is correct and what's the small machine called ","okay i found out to it's a lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about water and that paragraph "
2466,210.4,Oliver,,"It's what NASA sent it will look at the tax. I'm going to help you read it. Okay, NASA send a small machine. So what does that just that first little bit of text tell you ","i'm a fan for machine Oh, the Lunar Orbiter. "
2470,420.1,Oliver,,"so if you read the text and you read the question what words are kind of synonyms for each other ","i'm okay equipment is machine "
2473,110.4,Jazmin,,"very good ","That equipment is machine. "
2478,420.2,Jazmin,,"but you could clarify your statement a little bit more right well that'd be a good strategy ","yeah yeah i can add i can add a little bit more "
2480,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah "
2486,130.1,Luis,,"that's very knowledgeable of you point that out ","okay why equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
2490,120.4,Luis,,"now once you read your statement again ","yeah i said all scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank "
2493,210.3,Luis,,"so if you look into your statement does that answer the question ","i guess "
2496,510.1,Luis,,"You the strategy I talked about ","oh oh you mean like reread it again yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i already know the answer student student said it angers intended and deaths at it "
2498,120.4,Luis,,"okay so what is ","the lunar orbiter "
2501,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome good job that means just paying attention i appreciate it ","no problem all excuse me mr fortune arm i just looked at the clock and i'm it's time for us to lunch um but thanks for working with us we'll see you next time "
2508,110.1,Luis,,,"it was really good we got to chocolate chip cookies i got this all figured out figured out so good now "
2510,120.3,Luis,,"okay so what what why don't you use this new strategy then and let's look at second question from the text so student wants to read the second question for us ","okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
2513,120.3,Luis,,,"i read the question i read the story you said read the question read the story and then "
2518,120.1,Luis,,"using this strategy how would you answer that question no ","okay so i found the answer unless story um it says that water can be while it has water can be broken down into two parts but i wrote it in my own words water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we learned that those are valuable and finance class "
2524,120.4,Chris,,"once you read that to go back to student student what do you think about the answer to the question is ","okay i also kind of like student i definitely feel like i knocked it out the park this time because last time you said i didn't have anything about the equipment but this one is asking about water and valuable and so i think i answered it and i got it from the story "
2528,120.4,Chris,,"also let's hear ","ok ok so here we go um water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore valuable "
2533,210.3,Chris,,"how are you going to is that all of the information or just one part of it ","ok ok i guess i mean i guess since you're asking me it must be one part of it okay "
2538,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what was your answer to this question ","okay i'm still confused cuz i thought chris's answer was a good answer and my answer is a good answer but you're probably going to tell me that my answer is not a good answer till "
2543,120.4,Jazmin,,"say it's not a good answer i just say it might be some improvement there so student what you got ","yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
2545,210.4,Jazmin,,"and what does it say about water can be split into ","the thing that he said hydrogen and oxygen "
2547,210.3,Jazmin,,"that's right what else what other purposes does this takes point two for that answer ","oh there's more "
2550,120.4,Oliver,,"what was your answer sorry ","i mean was different from there so i don't know they said yeah but i said no i said no it's not ready yet "
2554,230.3,Oliver,,"it's not ready yet your answer isn't ready yet ","no i set up a water it's not ready yet cuz that's what i got from the story "
2559,230.1,Oliver,,"yeah and what led you that answer ","i'll pass that says i just kind of take a long time Oh yeah okay okay um and start convincing evidence that water in a moment can be valuable. So I said no. Now, commenting evidence because it's not ready. "
2564,110.1,Oliver,,"that's you know that's interesting way to think about that question ","Other ways "
2568,120.4,Farrah,,"well he's reading that what was your answer ","okay well i i thought that it was kind of similar to deaths where it was like not for a long time because it said making this plan will take a lot of time and money "
2577,120.4,Luis,,"did you class did you have any luck searching for more stuff over there ","um yeah we found some stuff okay so um i took luis's idea about the hydrogen and oxygen because it says that they could breed the oxygen and also it says oxygen hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel "
2580,110.1,Oliver,,"boom very good ","far tomorrow "
2583,230.3,Chris,,"nothing i can't remember who said it but you have saving way i think it was student right ","yeah yeah i said that "
2587,120.4,Luis,,"right student what's another use ","rocket fuel all "
2589,210.3,Oliver,,"right and they have what do you know there's one more i think ","i can help help cars malls own could be stopped for spacecraft it could be a gas station "
2592,210.3,Farrah,,"very much and student there's one more ","i thought class said everything "
2595,210.3,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah student student so "
2597,210.3,Oliver,,,"with the right "
2605,230.3,Chris,,"right it might be expensive and take a long time but yes so these are all the things that you should listen ","okay um you know i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
2607,110.1,Chris,,"oh that is just around the corner that'd be pretty cool huh ","oh "
2609,230.2,Chris,,"where did you read that in the text ","hey oh yeah that was it "
2615,150.1,Oliver,,"alright class any more questions can be any other way do you understand what we're doing now that you need to specifically look at the question ","That makes the high. Yeah, it makes sense. I think about. We all felt like we did at this time, but you're like, Hey, go back again. it's like "
2617,510.1,Oliver,,"if you want to be good at something you keep doing it over and over and over ","yeah yeah okay well thanks for helping us i do appreciate that you you had us keep going back to the question and back to that question back to the question and back to the text back to the text to find evidence "
2621,520.1,All,,"thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ","okay bye "
2623,120.2,Luis,,"hi class so our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question yes student ","um yeah so i kind of know all about space already like i don't think i need to even in this "
2628,230.2,Farrah,,"i have your responses in front of me but i'm curious to know what evidence did you circle in the tech so we're going to go around and i would like you to share with me the evidence that you used student let's start with you ","okay so basically so what i circled in the text was that the the microscope know what i mean like that the microscope was the equipment that they used to study the ice basic "
2632,110.1,Oliver,,"okay so you you focus on microscope and circle the microscope ","i pretty much use the same thing like i looked at the third paragraph and that was where i found like what i was mostly looking "
2635,230.2,Chris,,"student what evidence did you circle ","so basically what i looked at what's up well actually i guess i didn't really circle well no i looked at the craters and they said how the craters had water "
2638,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay so you found that the craters are full of water so what the scientists are really looking for are the craters where the water is found right awesome ","that the first sentence or two and i was like i basically was looking at like the small and i just want like i still don't understand why my answers "
2644,230.2,Luis,,"and i want to hear from student really quickly student what evidence did you find were you able to circle specific evidence in the text to help you ","um you know i actually was thinking about all that i knew about space and i kind of knew that you know the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i guess i just thought like i kind of know this though i mostly just wrote down on the side "
2655,420.1,Luis,,"What might be a key word in that question that we can use to help us answer the question, what's a key word. ","um yeah so i'm i'm thinking from how you said it that discovery like it's a question of like how how do we discover how did we find "
2658,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay how did we discover how did we find the water ","i basically had the same thing i said discover and like it was something that like how you know it made me like how stuff "
2661,110.1,Farrah,,"yes and survey anna ","um i actually i was thinking based on what you said i was thinking maybe it was discovered well so i'm still kind of not totally understanding but i think i'm beginning to understand that that maybe the microscope was you to to discover the world like if that's a keyword maybe it's a different piece of equipment "
2664,230.3,Chris,,"awesome so student says that maybe if our keyword and our keyword is discover maybe if our keyword is discover i'm trying to find something that helps me locate where the water is found student what did you want to add ","well i just i i kind of like okay i was thinking about out my dad took me to nasa and when we went like you know what even said like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i was like how could they how could they not use i was just wondering like you know what i mean "
2670,210.2,Jazmin,,"when i first discover something what are we doing student ","you're finding it like you're you're seeing it for the for the first time "
2674,110.1,Oliver,,"so you all were the same so when you def ","yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um it was really cool to have you like helping us so thank you so much "
2680,530.1,Farrah,,"about our keyword discover and you were thinking about how that was changing your thinking can you go back to that ","oh well so basically like okay so at first i thought like okay you're gonna discovers you have use the microscope to see because we know that the ice is microscopic so if i figured well you'd have use a microscope to to discover but it sounds like we can i think you use the word or it sounds like we get it or that that they they use like other and it sounds also like because we don't see the feeling that you know what i mean that that the astronauts are on the lunar orbiter they must have some kind of other do you you know you know what i mean "
2682,110.1,Luis,,"yeah so let's go back to what student do you have a question ","well i was gonna remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut so that's pretty "
2686,210.2,Jazmin,,"so what what might they have used to first discover i remember student said when we discover something i'm finding it i'm looking for it i am seeing it for the first time i'm able to locate it so what might the scientist have used to first initially locate that water student ","so basically nothing stops and it's not like i shouldn't do that it's the lunar orbiter that's the small "
2696,430.2,Chris,,"So that means that I can't just stop at NASA sent a small machine. I need to dig a little deeper. And what else does the passage. Tell me, so it says that that small machine was called a ","it says lunar orbit "
2698,210.2,Chris,,"so what equipment did the scientist use and send out to the moon to first discover and locate water on the moon ","the scientists use the lunar orbiter "
2704,210.4,Chris,,"microscope microscope so are scientists using a lot of equipment ","Yeah, they're using. I mean, they're using a bunch of "
2707,210.4,Oliver,,"yes so they are using a microscope but what is the microscope helping scientists do ","like the microscope is helping the scientists to it's helping them study the water like after its bow right so they they use it sounds like the lunar orbiter to find it and then they they use the microscope to study the microscopic water right "
2712,510.1,Oliver,,"remember when we looked at our question we found a keyword ","A, keyword, keyword "
2715,510.1,Farrah,,"keyword to help us and to answer the question ","so the keyword was up okay so it was like discussed right so it was equipment but it was also discussed "
2727,420.2,Farrah,,"keep reading what small machine get very specific with your answer and be sure to answer every single part of the question using evidence from the text student ","yeah so we have to go to our next class but before we go to class i really wanted to bring up like first up i really wanted to you for helping us to your meaning of the word discover like at first it was a little music i think for us but i think that we all understand now like basically what it means and why it was so and then you help this like use evidence from the text to like you know answer our question that we made sure we were looking back at what we read and then even beyond that like you really asked us to use like like how what are the key was behind you know what i mean our answer so we like i think class understands clearly "
2729,420.2,Jazmin,,,"hi "
2732,130.2,Farrah,,"so i would like to know i would like to hear from student and why you found what you found and then why your elbow partner agrees with you ","okay well so i found the like microscope to be really important because like that's something that like the astronauts would have to look like if they wanted to see the water "
2734,130.2,Luis,,,"okay so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space there's no way that i got any of these questions wrong "
2736,120.2,Luis,,"well what was your answer to what equipment id scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well so my answer was like they had to use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like all the stuff that astronaut would need if they were going up in space "
2738,230.1,Luis,,"and how did you gather that information ","well i knew it already "
2741,130.2,Farrah,,"would class else like to build on his response ","oh yeah so i think that he's right about equipment but i don't think that like i don't think he was i don't think he was reading ma'am i think she was just saying stuff like that he knew like i looked at it and i said like i think it's a microscope because how could you even see the water if you couldn't see the fragment like if you didn't use a microscope you know what i mean like i don't understand why my answers wrong "
2745,110.2,Chris,,"i would like to see if student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and they did ","like okay so like i went to nasa like with my dad and like i like know already that like you have to use spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like kind of like what student was saying like i saw it in the exhibits like i i just already knew that that you have to use all that stuff "
2748,230.1,Chris,,"so student did you read our passage ","ah um sort of "
2751,120.4,Jazmin,,"student i would like to hear from you ","what i said was that scientists is used a small machine "
2753,210.4,Jazmin,,"and where did you find that out in the passage ","so it was in paragraph two the first sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
2757,230.1,Oliver,,"and student then actually student you agree with student will you tell me where you found your answer ","um yeah so basically um okay so where i found my answer was the same place that student did in paragraph three that they said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2760,230.3,Chris,,"very good so student also is able to go back and tell me the paragraph and where he found that in the passage ","well i guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things but i guess i'm confused like it sounds like the answer of jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like student and student like i don't understand like did the astronauts who saw the water did they use a microscope "
2762,230.1,Chris,,"what do you think ","i'm um i don't know cuz i feel like they it doesn't say that there were astronauts but how could they be in space if there weren't astronauts "
2764,130.2,Chris,,"why don't student you talk with student i want to see what you two can come up with together ","okay "
2767,230.1,Luis,,"student what are you thinking ","i'm like i'm like i'm kind of thinking that like i understand i gotta look at the paragraph so i gotta see so if i look at it after i looked at it and listen to jazmin's answer like yeah i guess so lunar orbiter and i guess maybe they had astronauts or maybe they didn't but i guess yeah that's kind of what i think is that one "
2774,130.2,Oliver,,"so student was looking in paragraph two they sent a small machine and student and student thought that they needed a microscope so why don't the for the five of you talk together and combine those answers ","so i just i just wanted to say um because we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for coming into the classroom today and working with us like sometimes we get really are like we really frustrate our science teacher and i feel like you really took the time to listen to what we were saying and like really thought about like what our answers were and you also like really helped us to like work together because sometimes we get a little um we get a little irritable with each other so i think that it was really nice to like work together so like thank you a lot for like making that happen hi "
2776,130.2,Chris,,,"hello "
2778,130.2,Oliver,,,"well doing well we're excited to work with you today "
2784,230.1,Luis,,"why do you say that ","um well okay so first off i feel like i should even be in this class like i know a lot about space and i know all this stuff like i don't have to do the reading to know that you need like oxygen tanks and all that other stuff i already know that "
2787,120.1,Luis,,"you remember what we were talking about on the in the story about the equipment ","yeah so i guess like well do the astronauts need those tanks like when they're looking at the water on the moon "
2789,120.2,Luis,,"well they will need it to help them breathe but what is the equipment that they used to see the things on the moon ","gotcha okay that makes a lot of sense "
2791,120.4,Farrah,,"the small things on the moon was having to be looked at through a what student ","so i said microscope but i'm not quite sure like why is my answer wrong "
2793,120.4,Farrah,,,"yeah like cuz we're all here to like work with you and like away from the class so i figured like maybe like i did something like i said like it's like i feel like my answers wrong but like i don't know why "
2795,110.2,Farrah,,"no your answer was correct it you do need the microscope in order to see things that are very very small that are smaller than what you can see with your human eyes ","oh okay great "
2798,230.1,Oliver,,"why did you choose that ","yeah so um i said that because on in paragraph three it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
2802,110.2,Jazmin,,"that's good that's correct yes student ","i guess my question is like so if farrah's answer is right like is my answer wrong just like the small machine like is that not like is that not the thing that like you used to discover the water like i'm confused like if my answers wrong Okay. "
2804,110.2,Chris,,,"um so like i was saying like i went to nasa and i know like a lot about like what the scientists use and like the equipment they have to use and like i know they have to use like oxygen tanks and like masks and suits and stuff like that "
2808,110.2,Chris,,"that's correct they wouldn't need all that in order to protect them while they're in outer space or on the moon ","so did they send the astronauts with the machine or did they just send the machine student i don't know "
2811,110.1,Farrah,,"oh that's something that we can look at together in some of our other stories whenever we start studying a little bit more on this ","okay gotcha okay that makes sense so i guess like i think that student and i are so are both of our interest correct or is one of us were correct "
2813,110.2,Farrah,,"both of you are correct on what machinery is needed to to locate and find and to be able to see the particles from the moon ","okay that makes sense "
2817,110.2,Oliver,,,"um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and just thank you i'm like you were very patient with us and like sometimes our science teacher gets a little frustrated with our class but like you're so patient and you really like listened to our answers and like tried to help us to like put our answers together and think about class else's and we don't always do that so i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool "
2821,110.2,All,,,"hi "
2823,110.2,Luis,,,"i'm good but mr teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
2825,110.3,Luis,,"ok what all do you know about space let me know and that way you can help me with the rest of the class ok what do you know ","i know that astronauts have to wear spacesuits cause they can't breathe on the moon and in space and then they also wear gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and i know that they have boosters that get them up into space and then they have to wait for a window in order to come back to earth "
2827,140.1,Chris,,"ok that is a lot of good information does class else have anything to say about that any input on what you think about space ","yes yes my dad me and my dad went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to "
2829,140.1,Chris,,"ok why would why do you think that they would need the oxygen tanks ","because they can't breathe the atmosphere on the space shuttle and on the moon isn't the same as the atmosphere here "
2832,140.1,Jazmin,,"how about student can you tell me something that you know about space that can also add in with what student and student is telling us ","well i don't know a lot about space but i know that our environment is really bad and so we might have to live on mars or something if they keep destroying our earth "
2834,140.1,Oliver,,"that is a good point because if our atmosphere which is the air that we breathe which is in the oxygen tanks that we are talking about going into space if that is messed up then we won't have any air here on earth so we would have to look for some other place to possibly live how about you student do you have anything to input ","i'm not really into space so "
2836,140.1,Farrah,,"ok well that's ok a lot of people aren't into space some people are more into the environment like student was talking about some people are into the oceans and stuff which is very interesting too to learn about how about you student do you have any input to go with the class ","well i read i read this book a wrinkle in time which is about going to different universes so they didn't go into space but they traveled through space and time "
2839,140.1,Farrah,,"ok is that what you would consider a fiction or a nonfiction story ","laughs that is pretty cool fiction but if you look back in the older books from the past a lot of stuff has come out that people thought was just science fiction and would not happen and with science we have brought it about we are able to do a lot of things like back in the 1930s is that a long time ago "
2844,140.1,Farrah,,"and there was cartoons and books about phones ","really "
2847,140.1,Farrah,,"and people thought that was just going to be that was science fiction and that was not realistic but do we have it today ","oh wow yes yes we've got lots of phones yes i don't have one but i know student does "
2849,140.1,Chris,,"right right and it used to be science fiction that we would be able to go into space which is what we've been studying about is space and going to the moon and being able to do all these different explorations like have you seen the latest results and stuff from titan the moon on saturn ","oh man no no when me and my dad went to nasa we saw about that the whole controversy about when pluto was a planet and then it wasn't a planet and then it was a planet but i didn't know anything about saturn "
2853,140.1,Jazmin,,"well they're microscopic aliens that live in the very very cold because it's really really cold on the moon on that moon it's like 200 below zero so it's really cold there but they think that with their equipment like what they had on the moon that was that they used to find the water on the moon they think that they found some lifeforms that may have existed on titan ","huh oh wow that's pretty cool "
2855,140.1,Luis,,"yes that's pretty good stuff what do you think about that audio out you know there and outer space and stuff yes ","no i didn't know anything about the saturn stuff and the moons and like teeny-weeny aliens that's like wow i mean that is pretty cool stuff i didn't know that "
2857,140.1,Luis,,"yes yes and we'll go into more of that as we study on about outer space and the different equipment that they're using with the rockets and the satellites and stuff that they're using out there ","ok cool "
2859,140.1,Oliver,,"ok do you have anything else do you have any interest in that student about the aliens on the moon of saturn ","i mean i think aliens are kind of cool so yes i'd be down to learn about that "
2861,110.1,Jazmin,,"yes that's very good yes student ","mr lawrence but i didn't understand why my answer is wrong "
2864,140.1,Farrah,,"your answer wasn't wrong you were talking about the atmosphere which that is something that we are exploring in space to find different atmospheres that would hold life from earth which that is very good that you said ","no i meant on the story my teacher said that we all had to come and work with you in a small class because we needed more help with our answers but i told her that i think that i have the right answer oh well i thought i had the right answer too student but we're in this class i guess because our answers are wrong "
2868,150.1,Farrah,,"we're just looking at the way that we are seeing our answers in different ways and what perspective that we're coming from ","oh ok so then my one about let me see what did i i know i circled a part of the story oh yes ok so i said "
2873,110.1,Oliver,,"you were talking about the microscope ","the microscope yes yes but i the teacher had us all come over here and she said class else's answers were right yes yes well i had the same one as you student so i thought that the microscope was the right answer i don't know "
2877,210.2,Jazmin,,"now the specific question was what kind of equipment they used to dig up the water or find that water with and that was the rover ","Yes, but that's what I said. I said NASA sent a small machine. And that's the one, right there. So what's wrong with my answer? "
2879,110.2,Jazmin,,"There's nothing wrong with your answer. ","oh ok well so i just had to add the name to my answer and then i'm good to go "
2881,420.2,Chris,,"that would help and go into a little bit more detail about it ","ok but mr lawrence i had something completely different cause i took my answer from paragraph one so i mean i don't know what's wrong i don't know why i'm in this class either you know "
2884,150.1,Oliver,,"right well we've all been separated into a different class that way we can learn from each other and get some more perspectives on what we answered for these questions ","ok mr lawrence i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later "
2886,150.1,All,,,"bye "
2890,120.2,Luis,,"all right all right class we're moving on to question number two which is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","ok so i said that water could be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because remember my dad's an astronaut laughs "
2892,210.3,Luis,,"right so what would the use of being able to split the hydrogen and oxygen apart what benefit would that give the astronauts ","well i don't know i just saw it in the story and that looked like that was the important thing and i know i learned about it in science class "
2894,210.4,Luis,,"right that is an important thing so it can be separated out you can use the oxygen the astronauts could use that to breathe and they can also use that for fuel with hydrogen and the oxygen if they separate it out into the atoms they can make fuel out of it ","ok "
2896,210.3,Luis,,"so that's a good answer student you just need to go in a little bit more detail on that ok ","so i just have to write down what you said "
2898,150.1,Luis,,"in your own words you can do that ","ok i have to think about it then "
2900,150.1,Jazmin,,,"uh-huh "
2902,110.1,Jazmin,,"you said that astronauts can drink the water ","yes yes "
2904,110.1,Jazmin,,,"because "
2906,110.1,Jazmin,,"that's a good answer ","we take a bath here and we drink water a lot and i was remembering what student and student were talking about and yes you need water to live and so yes that's what i was thinking yes "
2909,230.3,Jazmin,,"yes which would also go in with what student was saying about water is so heavy if they had water on the moon they could use that to drink and they wouldn't have to carry the water all over the place and save up some room for their stops what do you think about that student ","yes yes i think that's why i said that because i got that from the story and you know what else mr lawrence "
2911,230.3,Jazmin,,,"they could use the water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon too "
2914,110.2,Jazmin,,"there you go they could ","i guess they'd have to bring the plants with them to plant on the moon "
2919,210.3,Jazmin,,"yes they would have to do that but they would have to work on their atmosphere right ","um um Oh yes, yes. Yes, yes. "
2921,140.1,Jazmin,,"So they would have to bring in an artificial greenhouse or something like that, possibly, maybe. ","oh yes yes right i forgot about that "
2923,130.2,Oliver,,"what do you think about that student ","i mean i guess it would be fine to grow stuff on the moon you know i guess i mean i'd probably want to have video games or something up there i think "
2926,110.1,Farrah,,"mhm yes the water on the moon can be all kinds used for all kinds of different things ","well i had said i answered no "
2928,110.1,Farrah,,,"cause they said in the story that it was like they need to study the moon's surface and making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it's like it would take a long time for that to happen so that's why i said no not for a long time "
2931,110.1,Farrah,,"ok that's a good answer it may not happen for a long time ","oh so is my answer wrong "
2935,130.3,Farrah,,"and actually the water would be valuable in the future ","ok "
2937,150.1,Farrah,,"ok ","ok ok "
2939,210.3,Chris,,"right now you may not see a use for water being on the moon but in the future as we continue with our space journeys and explorations then possibly water will be very very valuable on the moon ","mr lawrence "
2941,210.3,Chris,,,"i was thinking about what student said and you know how water could be broken down into two parts you know like hydrogen and oxygen i was like yes so then they could breathe right and then student could have a moon garden but i don't see how they could have fuel out of that "
2943,210.4,Chris,,"well the rockets the hydrogen will break up into it breaks down and it's able to make rocket fuel which help the spacecrafts move and like in the story it's like the cars you know how you put gas in a car ","uh-huh "
2945,210.4,Chris,,"and that helps your car to go without the gas your car won't go just like the rocket fuel which is made out of different strands of the hydrogen and also some oxygen that would fill their gas tank so they can move out and go throughout space ","ok ok "
2947,310.1,Chris,,"that's a good question ","and is my answer did i get it right when i said that the water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships anymore "
2950,210.4,Jazmin,,"it says in the text that the water is heavy and if there was water on the moon then they wouldn't have to carry it which would be a lot of drain on their fuel supply and it would also take up a lot of space in their spacecraft so being able to stop somewhere and pick up water is a lot better than having to carry it around with you all the time ","Excuse me, Mr. Lawrence? "
2952,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch "
2954,210.4,Jazmin,,,"but i wanted to say i appreciate that you helped me understand the meanings of some of water with the hydrogen and oxygen and what will be necessary and i guess also helped me and student kind of if we put our answers together then we'd have one right answer is that right "
2956,210.4,Luis,,,"ok oh cool so yes you've got to put me in there too student "
2958,210.4,All,,,"ok bye mr lawrence "
2960,210.4,Oliver,,,"hi "
2963,210.4,Farrah,,,"oh well we're excited to work with you "
2967,140.1,Luis,,"how did class like the reading ","yeah so like here's my thing like no offense but i don't think i should be in this class like i know everything about space already so like i don't know why i should have to be here "
2970,220.1,Luis,,"just to see what we can take away from our just our reading and then our discussion so we're just in this all together just looking at this little reading together ","okay okay okay i'll give it a try "
2973,120.2,Jazmin,,"alright so our question was what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon ","yes i think it was a small machine "
2977,230.2,Jazmin,,"but what was the name of that small machine does class know ","i don't know where would i let's see i guess it's like the lunar orbiter is that the machine "
2981,110.4,Farrah,,"that is the machine that collected the water ","um okay so here's what's interesting like okay so i think like the microscope is something that the astronauts used to look at the water but i don't understand cuz like you you wanted us to come and work over here so i'm kind of thinking like on maybe like okay so like why is my answer not quite right "
2983,110.2,Farrah,,"your answer is so you said you think of the scientific tool is called a microscope to look really closely at it right student ","yeah yeah "
2986,130.3,Farrah,,"alright so the lunar orbiter is just a machine that collected the water but then the the actual equipment to see the water was the microscope ","oh okay okay "
2989,150.1,Chris,,"does class else have any questions on why it is the microscope ","i think like the thing that i think so like okay so i kind of went to nasa like my dad took me to nasa so like i kind of feel like i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like they use oxygen tanks and masks and suits but i guess like i wonder if like the astronauts were on the lunar orbiter or if it was an unmanned aircraft "
2991,230.3,Chris,,"so you're thinking it was an unmanned aircraft meaning that there was nobody on the moon but they sent just a machine correct ","yeah "
2994,210.3,Chris,,"so according to that do we think they people were actually on the moon at that time or did they just send that machine called the lunar lunar orbiter ","not sure "
2999,210.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so two things like i think like the lunar orbiter like probably like okay so if you do the reading and you look at the reading if you look like it doesn't say that like there are astronauts it just says that there's a machine it doesn't say that there are any astronauts it just says machines "
3001,110.4,Jazmin,,"Correct. I would, I would agree with that. ","so i think what i'm wondering is like okay so if the lunar orbiter was this machine and it went up there did the lunar orbiter like discover something and like was it the thing that like kind of found the water um i wonder like i feel like i feel like are both student and my answer correct "
3007,410.2,Jazmin,,"but i think it was wanting to be a little bit more specific and getting a little bit more detail from the reading about the microscope and lunar orbiter so you're on the correct track student we just need to push it a little bit more into detail ","yes we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before we left for lunch that it was being nice just having you today and it was really nice to like talk to you and i think like one thing like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you really have to listen to each other and you really asked us to like rethink our answers and you were really patient with us and sometimes our teachers aren't as patient and so i just wanted to thank you for like really just like spending the time to like listen to our answers because that was really cool "
3011,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah well excuse me i shouldn't be ms class i already know all about space "
3019,120.4,Farrah,,"so would class like to share one of their responses for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon s ","yeah okay so i said um let me look back at my paper i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yes you do need a microscope to look at things that are really small now the question let's look at the question again the question says what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon now what are some keywords that kind of help us to find the answer in in the text equipment "
3023,110.4,Chris,,"equipment i ","water and water I thought I thought water was an important one, too. "
3026,210.3,Jazmin,,"student or student did you have any other keywords ","i said equipment and i thought i circled discovered in the question for me "
3029,210.2,Luis,,"yes i believe equipment discover water those are all three keywords that we need to look at for this for answering this question ","well i think moons pretty important you know i mean that's where they are "
3031,210.2,Oliver,,"now when you discover something have you looked at some when you discover something new does that mean you've already looked at it before ","i don't i guess no i guess not "
3038,210.4,Oliver,,"if we can look back at paragraph two so take a moment look back at paragraph two ","okay oh oh wait nevermind i just realized you said paragraph two cuz i found my answer in paragraph three "
3041,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
3043,410.2,Jazmin,,"student you said that nasa sent a small machine right they did send a small machine but what i'm looking for is what is also the name of that small machine ","oh lunar orbiter "
3048,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","yeah so i just have to add the name of it and then my answers fine "
3050,130.3,Jazmin,,"where you would add the name of it and then you would add what type of water or what was the size of the water of what that they found so they would add that so the answer like a complete answer that i'd be looking for would be that the lunar orbiter was a small machine that found microscopic water on the earth or on the moon ","okay okay "
3052,420.2,Chris,,"so you got to pull those things together ","i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
3056,410.1,Chris,,"but yes student you are correct that those are all different types of equipment that astronauts use but for this particular question it was the equipment that they used to discover water ","so but ok but they don't actually say anything about water and and paragraph true they only talk about water in paragraph i mean i say they say like you can drink water um but it doesn't say that like i didn't i didn't see discover or water in that paragraph "
3058,210.4,Oliver,,"now look in paragraph two okay now what is a different form of water there's different forms of water there's a frozen form what is that called student ","oh oh yeah ice "
3061,210.4,Chris,,"yes so ice is just a different form of water it's just water in a different form it's frozen solid ","oh oh okay okay okay um so it talks about ice and it talks about the lunar orbiter but it doesn't say anything about discover and and i know we're supposed to look for the word discover and i don't see it in there "
3065,120.3,Oliver,,"But in that first paragraph. it says that scientists have for long time that the moon is a desert, because it is it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. However, they used to believe there was no water on the moon. Oliver. ","sorry to interrupt mr teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so we'll have to see you again later okay "
3070,230.3,Luis,,"now i noticed that student and student noticed that there is they said that there's not any evidence right and then student student and student did say that there is some evidence student what did you have to say ","i think i got this figured out so i'm all good "
3073,420.1,Luis,,"Does anybody have a key word that they want to look at? ","okay i think that it was evidence "
3075,110.1,Chris,,"Evidence. So what so evidences one. ","i said water again this time because i think that's what the whole thing is about "
3080,230.2,Chris,,"student what was one piece of evidence that you thought about this that some evidence that said water could be valuable ","yeah so um info which paragraph was it okay yeah in the first one because it's the whole the title is water is a valuable resource right so i said the thing about water is heavy so it's it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
3084,310.1,Luis,,"so way to use that evidence there for for a reason for water being valuable to us all right now ","wait yeah so a my answers is good but i don't understand why i gotta be in this class because i did that i did everything right right "
3087,150.1,Jazmin,,"yes you did a great job on that we are just wanting to i'm just pulling people together just trying to get different ideas because there's difference of opinions on this question so we're just trying to get a sample size of different answers ","okay yes still can yeah i'm still confused "
3089,230.1,Jazmin,,"what are you confused about student ","well because if if he got the right answer then i thought that i had the right answer "
3097,310.1,Jazmin,,"so yes that's another great example of convincing evidence ","wait i have to i have to write down all the other stuff that you just said "
3101,420.2,Jazmin,,"and waters on the moon that's convincing evidence that it is valuable so we just have to rework your answer ","okay i have to add something about convincing evidence you can't survive without water that is convincing evidence okay is that good "
3107,230.2,Luis,,"yep and that can be water can be split in those two different elements all right now student where did you find that in the text ","oh there it is there it is okay your paragraph five in my second sentence yeah "
3109,210.4,Oliver,,"That is important, but what's the reason why they would want to break down what was the reason why they wanted to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. What could they use hydrogen and oxygen for ","well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
3111,210.3,Luis,,"yes there could be and that would be great for for another reason but let's look back at if we have people on base don't they need oxygen to breathe ","yeah yeah okay so then that's so okay so then that's my answer so that they can breathe "
3113,210.3,Luis,,"so they would use the oxygen breathing now what about the hydrogen part of it why would the hydrogen be useful for ","look back at paragraph i don't know "
3115,210.4,Luis,,"look at paragraph five ","oh rocket fuel rocket fuel "
3119,210.4,Luis,,"we could use that have they split that water and they use that hydrogen oxygen for rocket fuel and that's how they could get to the moon and they can leave from the moon right so that's another reason why water could be such a valuable commodity ","teacher i gotta write down i gotta write down all of that stuff that you just said that's a long answer man "
3122,420.2,Luis,,"Is just that we can add that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen because it allows people to breathe and you can make rocket fuel with it. ","How come. How come I have to add all of that and Chris Chris and Jazmin didn't have to add all that to their answers. "
3126,210.3,Farrah,,"student and student have your answers changed at all after discussing chris's jazmin's and luis's ","oh i mean i can see i can see where they're coming from but i still think that i was right i said not for a long time you know "
3128,210.3,Farrah,,"what what can you go into a little bit more detail for that ","i'm here yeah they're not gonna be able to have water for like a long time so so the answer's no "
3130,230.3,Farrah,,"okay so since you said and with no so that means there's is there small amounts of water on the moon as what we believe ","okay yeah yeah cuz we read that in the first part it says they're small amounts yeah "
3133,210.3,Farrah,,"yeah and so since they're small amounts are we going to be able to use it as use it like the amount of water that we use on earth ","nope "
3138,420.2,Oliver,,"I lost my train of thought,  just so that we can explain a little bit more on why you think it's not going to be able to be useful, just because they're smaller amounts of it. Okay. ","teacher it that looks like our time for the next class took out but i know i heard you're telling class that they have to add more details to their answer so i'm sure that's what you were going to tell me too is that we have to have more more evidence from the text and our answers "
3140,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay well we'll see you next time "
3143,420.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing great we're really happy to see you "
3145,420.2,Luis,,,"i don't think i need to be in this class you know cuz i already know like all about space you know so i don't need any help "
3148,220.1,Luis,,"and our question was what equipment was used to find that water now mr student a lot of us found different types of equipment or we used background knowledge but that's not exactly what the question was asking us to do okay so can we look at deeper into that question is that okay yeah ","that's that sounds great "
3153,210.4,Jazmin,,"can class tell me if they heard something in the two sentences we just read that sounds like it might answer the question what equipment was used ","basically it was this small machine i think that's how they found the water "
3156,310.1,Jazmin,,"good i see where you're going with that ","that makes sense okay i didn't really answer the question so lunar orbiter "
3158,110.4,Farrah,,"good job student thank you so much miss student ","um yeah i wondering like i think i'm still confused like why my answer is wrong "
3160,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so can you tell me your answer again ","oh yes so basically my answer was just that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3162,230.1,Farrah,,"okay and i want to ask you do you know what we use a microscope for ","i'm like you know you use it to like look at small things like in science we look at like bacteria and stuff like that "
3164,230.2,Farrah,,"good okay and where did you find in the text that it talked about microscope ","um let's see it was i think it was in paragraph three "
3167,110.4,Farrah,,"words in paragraph three ","oh sorry "
3172,210.4,Farrah,,"the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","yeah right there "
3175,210.3,Farrah,,"good okay so you did you found a piece of equipment you found a tool that was used but did it say that this microscope was used to find the water to begin with was this the first machine that they use to find the water ","well i guess i'm guessing not do you have any ideas for how i can find like or like you know what i mean like how i could tell the difference because it seems like they would have to look through the microscope to see the water how could they find it if they couldn't see it "
3180,120.3,Farrah,,"so if we look at paragraph two i just want you you can read it to yourself or you can read it out loud could you read the first sentence of paragraph to to me ","that's just a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate Yeah a lunar orbiter. "
3186,210.4,Chris,,"so i know that the scientists back in paragraph one they found out that there was water on the moon because they had craters that had ice in them but how did they find out that the craters had ice in them do you remember how that happened we just read a little part of it ","um yeah so like um well i went to nasa and and i saw like exhibit so i was thinking that you know they would have to use oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that "
3190,410.2,Chris,,"mr student did you consider that those machines were not mentioned in our text ","oh okay oh yeah okay okay "
3192,430.2,Chris,,"So even though we might have prior knowledge, which is what you have, because she went to NASA. That's amazing. And that's awesome to bring to the table, but I want you to try to find the answer in the text. Okay. ","gotcha okay that makes sense "
3194,150.1,Oliver,,"okay and student i just wanted to touch back with you and student i know you had the same answer is student are you class feeling a little bit more comfortable with going back further into the text mr student ","um yeah i think that we are getting more comfortable unfortunately we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us "
3198,230.1,Oliver,,"i see a lot of good thinking and student i really loved how you dug in the text and student it looks like you dug in the text to you're saying that you said the same thing as student you circled the same thing can you tell me a little bit more about how you got to that conclusion ","um yeah so basically like i circled the same thing like in the paragraph three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3201,110.2,Luis,,"good good job all right student you have a question ","um yeah i guess this is kind of a question um so here's the thing like i know all about space like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't really get answers about space like wrong and like i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i have to do any work on it "
3206,210.4,Luis,,"About oxygen tanks. So can you find maybe another type of equipment that they might have used to help find water on the moon. ","so i gotta find something that's in the text like not like from my own like memory like i gotta read the text "
3209,120.1,Luis,,"absolutely you always have to dig into that text and just pretend like you don't know anything else at that point you've just got to find it in there when you find something in the text could you let me know ","yeah definitely "
3212,130.2,Chris,,"what did you say student do you think that equipment might possibly be a small machine as well ","um yeah i think it could be um i just feel like also like for me like i went to nasa and i know that scientists have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to go into space "
3215,120.1,Chris,,"they do and they have to have that stuff to keep them alive and well while they're out there that's a very good point but just like we were telling mr student we have to find it in the text ","yeah i can i can take a look "
3217,120.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so here's what i was wondering um so i said that the the microscope was how they studied the water but i don't understand like why my answer is why my answers kind of wrong "
3219,210.3,Farrah,,"hmm why do you think your answer is wrong ","like i'm thinking about like who cuz you know how we're all here together like to to like better find our answers and our thinking so like i think the microscope like they definitely used it and i think that's how they discovered it but maybe my answers wrong "
3230,230.2,Jazmin,,"ok so that's paragraph two does it talk about a piece of equipment that they used ","i think what's interesting is that it was kind of like my answer but there was like there was more to my answer so i said they sent a small machin but the small machine is the lunar orbiter so that's how i think they discovered the water "
3232,130.2,Jazmin,,"that is absolutely correct good job student okay i want you class to give me can you give me a thumbs up if you agree a thumbs in the middle if you're not quite sure or thumbs down if you disagree with student can you class do that ","well we can't quiet do the thumbs but we could do raised hands if we agree and then no raise hands if we disagree is that okay "
3240,110.4,Jazmin,,"okay so student agrees student and student agree student agrees good job class all right you can put your hands down ","we have to go to lunch we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to take a minute to thank you for working with us like like sometimes our science teacher gets kind of frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us understand like the difference between like discovering something and the difference between like studying it and also like i feel like student and student like they it seems like they understand better like that you have to really use the text you can't just use like information from your life you have to study the text so i just wanted to thank you cuz it was really clear and it was really interesting to hear other people's answers so thank you so much "
3246,110.4,Luis,,,"um yeah i think like i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
3248,120.4,Luis,,"okay student what did you create your answer to ","um so basically what i was saying was that scientists found ice using a small machine "
3253,130.2,Farrah,,"did class get a different answer from student um student what did student what do you get ","yeah i actually did get a different answer because i was still kind of thinking that it was the microscope i feel like you know like that was really the equipment that they use to find the water okay so you know initially that's what i thought too but then i revise my answer to scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon "
3256,230.1,Farrah,,"student how did you get to that answer ","that's a really interesting question like i got to the answer partially by listening carefully to student and her answer and to our discussions together but really think that i got to the answer by reading the text more close because i think that i missunderstood the question because they didn't use the microscope to find the water they used the microscope like afterwards to study the water but it was the lunar orbiter that really found the water "
3259,150.1,Farrah,,"student and student does that help clarify that question ","um yeah i think that that makes sense because yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so like student you're saying that like basically like that you know if you use like a microscope to see the water after you find it you have to find it first is that right yeah "
3261,150.1,Chris,,,"oh um i actually didn't mean to raise my hand up sorry "
3263,150.1,Jazmin,,,"and i just wanted to say that i changed my answer "
3265,230.1,Jazmin,,"what did you change your answer to student ","basicallt my answer was incomplete and i was just saying small machine instead of like that it was the lunar orbiter you know what i mean "
3268,530.1,Jazmin,,"and how did you find that instead of small machine it was the lunar orbiter what did you do to make that change ","yeah that's a really good question i sort of thought about it first i looked more closely at the text that was thinking why was my answer wrong at first and i was trying to figure it out and basically you know if if the lunar orbiter was the small machine so i kind of had the answer but i just i just wasn't complete in what i was saying "
3271,120.4,Chris,,"okay um what other questions do you have student ","i guess like i went to nasa and so i i know that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and i guess i'm wondering like why that wasn't right "
3273,420.3,Chris,,"student why don't you go back and look at the text and maybe reread it and highlight some keywords or helpful passages then see if you can come to that answer yourself ","okay i'll take a look "
3275,420.3,Oliver,,,"unfortunately we have to go to lunch but um i think we'll see you again soon "
3277,420.3,Chris,,,"hi how are you "
3279,420.3,Luis,,,"doing well "
3281,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's what i was thinking um i know all about space so like i don't think i have to be in this class because i feel like i know everything there is to know already "
3283,110.1,Luis,,"oh really ","yeah "
3286,120.2,Luis,,"okay so why do you what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon student ","um so i think that the what they used was oxygen tanks and um space suits and all that kind of stuff because otherwise they wouldn't be able to be on the moon and like run around "
3290,230.2,Luis,,"was there any other equipment that you think they used to discover water by could you look back on the text and think about what they actually use to discovered water on the moon ","i didn't really read it so i can read it i guess "
3292,120.3,Luis,,"so why don't you take two minutes and read over the passage and tell me what you think that scientists used to discover water on the moon ","okay i'll do that "
3295,150.1,Farrah,,"does class else have any questions ","okay so here's my main question i'm trying to understand like why my answer is wrong "
3299,410.2,Farrah,,"your answer is about how the kind of water that they found was microscopic but it doesn't really say how they got the water ","yes so like so okay so the question was like how did scientists discover water on the moon and like so they use a microscope for like something for like to like study the water "
3301,410.1,Farrah,,"yes so the water they found you would use a microscope to study it but it doesn't explain how they found the water ","oh ok ok gotcha "
3304,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay thank you student for your question any other questions ","student do you know how scientists discovered water on the moon basically the scientists used a small machine "
3306,230.2,Jazmin,,"you know what the small machine was called ","i can look it up "
3308,230.2,Jazmin,,,"it's paragraph two it says nasa small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter "
3313,130.2,Chris,,"or class else find anything different ","yeah so i think like i kind of disagree like i went to nasa with my dad and we like looked at like the stuff that they use to like fly around and i feel like the scientists like would have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like when they're out in like the space like they'd have to you know use all that stuff so i'm still confused like why luis's answer was incorrect "
3319,150.1,Chris,,"that make better sense ","yeah i think that's a little clearer "
3322,150.1,Oliver,,"is anything else i can do to clear this up for you class ","um i guess like what i was wondering like um okay so like a small machine well okay so i think that i'm beginning to understand but can you help me understand just like super clearly like how the ok so the microscopes like not quite the right answer and i got the same answer as student so it sounds like the answer is the lunar orbiter but i just wanted to understand like why the lunar orbiter is the right answer and the microscope's not quite the right answer "
3324,150.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
3328,130.3,Oliver,,"and then the microscope is what she needs to study the water because it's so small that you need to microscope did this study yet but the lunar orbiter is how you discover the water ","so they use the lunar orbiter to like discover it and then microscope to like study it "
3332,110.1,Jazmin,,"yes yes that is correct ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you "
3334,110.1,Jazmin,,,"sure "
3339,110.1,Jazmin,,,"i just wanted to take a moment and thank you like sometimes our science teacher gets frustrated with us but you were so patient in listening to like what we had to say and then also like you like took our answers and you like kind of helped us to understand each other's answers and like understand better like kind of about the text but like by helping us listened to each other and sometimes we get kind of like in fights with each other but this was really easy for us to listen so just to like thank you for your patience and like helping us to listen to each other "
3341,110.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
3343,110.1,Chris,,,"we're doing good thank you "
3345,110.1,Luis,,,"um yes so here's the thing um i don't think i should be in this class because like i already know like all this stuff about space and i don't really need to be here for help "
3347,110.3,Luis,,"and that's okay maybe you can help me help someone else later let's wait off on that okay ","okay "
3349,230.3,Luis,,"let's see here student you mentioned a scientist like to use a lot of equipment yes ","yeah "
3351,230.1,Luis,,"all right you mentioned oxygen tanks why did you mention oxygen tank ","um so the reason that i mentioned it was because i know that like astronauts have to use oxygen tanks when they're going up into space and they have to use like stuff like that in order to walk around "
3357,230.2,Luis,,"all right what what part of this text that you read gave you the impression that they had to use them ","well i guess i didn't really look at the text because i already knew this Maybe there's something in there because I didn't, I didn't really read because I thought I already knew. Okay. "
3360,230.3,Farrah,,"student you mentioned a thing called a microscope and it does something to look really closely ","yeah "
3362,230.1,Farrah,,"okay what does a microscope look for how do you use it ","well like you use it to like study something and like look at something really closely you know what i mean like you you look at it like like small things "
3364,230.1,Farrah,,"oh well what exactly does the microscope do to help you look at small thing ","um so i think if i remember it's like you um okay so in the text is said that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so like i guess it helps you look at small things "
3366,310.1,Farrah,,"you're you're correct and i'm glad that you referenced the text because that was awesome and correct thank you student ","awesome but i have one question um like why is my it's because we're all here to like work on it together like what why is my answer not quite right "
3368,230.2,Farrah,,"well your answer says they use a microscope to look really closely but what are they looking closely at what can they use it to focus on like are they looking at something really small or really big yes student ","so i guess they're looking at like something really small they're looking at the water they're studying the water "
3371,110.1,Oliver,,"there you go there's something small that they're looking at is the water good job ","yeah i was gonna say basically the same thing like you can look closely at the water "
3373,230.1,Oliver,,"all right is there anything else that they could look closely at besides the water with a microscope ","um well like i don't know like what if like it's not really in the reading but like you could look at germs and stuff "
3375,230.2,Oliver,,"you could but what is something on the moon that they could look at on the moon they said the moon is a desert what else could they look at if they say desert ","ah they could look at like the sand and like the dirt "
3378,110.1,Jazmin,,"i think you're correct absolutely great job ","yes so i'm just so i guess my question is like so whose answer is like i thought that it was a small machine and i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not right "
3381,230.2,Jazmin,,"well i didn't say your answer was wrong it is technically correct they did send a small machine but what kind of small machine did they send can you tell me that student ","yeah well i guess i guess in the reading i guess i can look and see ok ok ok i see it so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is it the lunar orbiter "
3385,310.1,Chris,,"it is the lunar orbiter great job looking back at the text thank you for that ","um you know so like here's the thing like um like okay so i guess i don't understand still like because you have to like luis's answer like i went to nasa so like i know that you have to use a space soon if you're gonna go like walk around and study something so i'm trying to understand like why is my answer not quite right "
3388,230.1,Chris,,"can you tell me where they found the water on the moon ","oh they found it in the craters that were full of water "
3393,230.1,Chris,,"did they find it in the crater ","i thought that um i thought that's what they said Um, yeah, okay, um, scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on Earth. however they used to believe there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
3395,210.4,Chris,,"correct now did the text say the craters where full of water or was the water below the crater ","oh so like there wasn't much water like there was only some water because you had to look at it through the microscope "
3398,130.3,Chris,,"they didn't really use a microscope to find the water the water was located underneath the ground ","so how did they find the water "
3403,110.1,Jazmin,,"oh that is a great question i think that is something we could both look at for the next time we have class how did they find the water under the moon it's craters ","so we have to go to lunch but before we went i just wanted to take a moment and thank you for working with us today like sometimes like we really upset like the science teacher because he gets a little frustrated with us but you were so patient and you really like helped us to feel like we were part of like like a class like like that we weren't just wrong like that we had like some learning to do that we could do together and so like it was really nice that you are just so supportive of each of us as we try to learn about it so thank you so much "
3406,110.2,Luis,,"thank you student and absolutely none of you were wrong you were all correct to an extent thank you for being here go on to lunch ","um yeah i was just gonna say like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
3410,430.3,Chris,,"i like that you focused on the the craters in the moon but i'm a little concerned that you think they're full of water can you go back and look in section two or paragraph two of the text and try to find a quantity of ice or water inside that paragraph ","yeah oh i'm 32 ounces and 4 glasses "
3412,210.4,Chris,,"you're correct four glasses of water is that a lot of water on the moon it's not very much at all do you think that could fill up a crater ","no that's that's um that's not very much at all "
3414,210.4,Chris,,"it's not very much at all do you think that could fill up a crater ","i guess not so the craters aren't full at all "
3417,230.3,Farrah,,"and that special tool is what student mentioned student you mentioned that you they use a scientific tool called a microscope yes ","yeah that was people used to find it "
3420,430.3,Farrah,,"well that's where i'm concerned a microscope is used to look at objects not really to find them do you think you can look in paragraph two and find the name of the machine that's used to find the water ","yeah let me see i see well is it the is it the lunar orbiter "
3423,210.4,Farrah,,"you're right it is the lunar orbiter they use to find the water on the moon and did they find a lot of water or a little water ","no he just found a little water is that was what student found but i think i'm still a little confused just like why my answers not correct so like it seems like they found you know what i mean like yeah they use the orbiter but didn't they use the microscope because they could see it without the without the microscope right "
3426,130.3,Farrah,,"well scientists weren't on the moon to look at the water by themselves so they didn't need the microscope they had the machine the lunar orbiter investigating the ground for that water ","that's interesting so they didn't use the micrsoscope to find it they were using my something else on the lunar orbiter like a sensor or something like that "
3428,110.4,Farrah,,"oh absolutely that's how they would find it ","okay yeah okay yeah that makes sense so did they use the microscope i'm like it sounds like they used it so i guess did they say they had to do something else before they used the microscope "
3433,210.3,Oliver,,"now student you have the same answer as student did you follow along with what we just went with ","um yeah i followed along so i think like okay so the lunar orbiter was the thing that discovered the water um and then like they use the microscope to study it after they found it "
3436,310.1,Chris,,"yes they could use the microscope after they found it to study it that's very good deduction there i like what you did there student ","um well i was just thinking so my dad took me to nasa and like when we were there like i know that but we saw that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like i was thinking like did they not use those things as oh "
3438,130.3,Chris,,"well i'm glad you brought that up well in our story in the moon is a desert it doesn't mention that the astronauts themselves were on the moon so they wouldn't have the need to include that equipment in our story today ","okay yeah okay so they weren't actually there so they didn't need to use masks and suits and stuff like that student like that's the thing to remember like they didn't do that is that right "
3442,410.3,Luis,,"and with that student let's look at student student you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but like we just talked about with student that oxygen tanks weren't exactly in our story so i'm concerned why you're talking about things not in our story ","yeah i was using up like you know how we talked about in class sometimes like background knowledge so i was using background knowledge and i was thinking like um you know like that was like probably enough to answer that question but i was thinking like i guess i was wondering like even though it wasn't in the story like why should i not use background knowledge this time "
3446,130.3,Luis,,"and they didn't use oxygen tanks although they do use them they did not use them to find the water on the moon ","gotcha oh ok so they did like okay that makes sense so it's really like what was in there reading so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with "
3448,130.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i think i got everything figured out so i think i'm all that "
3454,420.2,Luis,,"is there a place in the text that that mentions what hydrogen and oxygen can be used for ","me see yeah so you can use them for rocket fuel I'm like you could use like them mixed together and you can also read the oxygen And you can drink the water. "
3457,210.4,Jazmin,,"but how much water is on the moon ","you're talking about i remember that it wasn't actually a lot so i'm actually still kind of confused because it sounded like it sounded like there was it very much why is there enough water for astronauts "
3461,210.4,Jazmin,,"there probably isn't enough to drink on the moon but what do you think they can do to get more water on to the moon ","take it with them On a spaceship. "
3464,210.4,Jazmin,,"would that increase the value of water on the moon if they brought it with them ","we get i think it would be like yes it would be more valuable if it was on the moon like already and then they could just build their even and they could see it right there "
3469,230.3,Chris,,"what it but you yeah but you say they wouldn't have to carry it on ships anymore ","yeah i'm i think what they were saying is that they were saying that like you could you know you could basically not have to take the water or you could just get it from the moon "
3472,410.3,Chris,,"well like we just talked about with student there's not a lot of water on the moon so i'm a little concerned that you're saying that astronauts don't need to take it on their ships anymore do you think they may still need to take some water with them ","yeah i guess so if there's like if there's not very much because we said that like there were only a few ounces right glasses on and so like it actually wouldn't be enough to you know what i mean do everything but i think it would be really valuable because water is so heavy but that doesn't make sense yet so they they still yeah they would still have to carry some on the ship "
3474,210.4,Chris,,"exactly and in paragraph one what does it say that the future astronauts could do you can find that in paragraph six ","they could drink the water "
3479,230.1,Oliver,,"teacher so with it being in the future student and student you mentioned that it's not ready and no not for a long time why do you think student and student that it's not valuable yet ","um so i think that's not valuable yet because it seems like it would be really complicated to actually get the water to a place where you're like all all yeah i can use us really easily like i read somewhere that they weren't going to maybe put a moon base up on the moon in 2024 and i was thinking like they they wouldn't like they don't really have figured out it seems like like they need to come up with a plan to get the water out of the moon like they said in the read "
3484,310.1,Oliver,,"exactly that's great use of your background knowledge about that space station that they're planning to build ","lots of time and money so that seems like like it seems like you know we don't spend like very much money on like space travel like that's something that i know from my reading so it seems like it would be kind of i'm like it seems like it would be kind of hard to like make this work because it seems like a really expensive "
3491,110.4,Oliver,,"oh absolutely would be expensive yes student ","um so unfortunately unfortunately we we have to go to our next class but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like explain to us what we all needed to work on like offering like the concerns that you had and you are so kind about the way offer them that i think we offer really okay with like hearing about concerns like i don't think class took it personally you know what i mean and i think like class like really learned something from being able to listen to each other so you really also give a suggestion on like how we should do so it was really fun working with thank you so much hi "
3493,110.4,Chris,,,"we're doing okay "
3496,120.2,Luis,,"good has class had a chance to answer their question what equipment did scientists to use to discover water on the moon ","um yeah okay so here's what i was just needed to say is i don't think i should be in this class like i don't like i know all about space already so like i don't think i need to be here "
3499,110.1,Luis,,"well that's aweseome so maybe you can help us teach the others since you know ","okay yeah "
3505,120.2,Farrah,,"so who's ready to tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah okay yeah yeah so um i said that the the scientists that they okay if i look at the text it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i think it was a microscope but i'm not sure like why my answers not right "
3508,110.1,Oliver,,"let's go and see what someone else said before we get back and talk about whose answer is correct student do you want to give your answer ","um yeah so i pretty much said the same thing as student and i circled the same area like in paragraph three that the um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i think you have to use a microscope to discover the water "
3511,110.1,Chris,,"right ","yeah so like for me like i kind of just like i went to nasa so like i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i know that they have to use all that stuff and like the craters are so full of water on the moon that like i guess it's pretty easy to find "
3513,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay student what do you think ","that okay so i think that it's this small machine "
3515,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay and what was a small machine called ","nasa send this machine called lunar orbiter to investigate so lunar orbiter "
3522,210.4,Luis,,"As I'm going back and looking in, and it says that the water they found is microscopic which means you you can't see it with your naked eye. So you would need exactly what Farrah and Oliver said, you would need a microscope to look really closely to see it. ","i guess i didn't really read it like i kind of knew the answer so i just kind of didn't read the text Yeah. "
3525,210.4,Luis,,,"um sure i'll take a look at it okay "
3529,110.2,Farrah,,"it is ","um so i think like so i can kind of wondering like who is right like is student right or are student and i right because like like is it the microscope that discovered the water or is it the lunar orbiter "
3533,130.3,Jazmin,,"you would need the microscope to be able to see it so you and your answer and oliver's answer was correct it was a microscope ","so my answer "
3535,130.3,Jazmin,,"but i guess you could say you know they did use the lunar orbiter also to investigate it but to actually see it you would need the microscope ","so is my answer wrong or is it like sort of right "
3539,130.3,Jazmin,,"so they use that the lunar orbiter to investigate but to see the water they had to use the microscope ","okay okay that makes sense "
3543,150.1,Oliver,,"any other questions ","um so we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment before we had to go to thank you like you were really patient with us and you like helped us like use our prior knowledge to like like be part of the discussion and so i just wanted to thank you for like taking the time to do that because it was really nice and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient with us "
3546,150.1,Jazmin,,,"good great "
3548,150.1,Luis,,"great i have what are your questions are the answers for the passage that you read water on the moon ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class teacher i know a lot about space "
3550,110.3,Luis,,"well that is wonderful i'm glad you know a lot about space but maybe our friends don't and maybe you can help me teach them some new things about space ","maybe i can teach you class some stuff yeah "
3555,230.1,Farrah,,"how did you come up with your answer student ","um well i saw the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for a paragraph that talks about equipment and water and so i found it in paragraph three "
3560,120.1,Oliver,,"so what about you student ","okay so art or science teacher always talks about microscopes when when it's time for us to take out microscopes she's like okay take out the equipment for science class and we're going to use the microscopes so then i was looking at a question and i was looking for something on the story that talked about like you know discovering water and i saw the part where it says you need a microscope which is a tool which is equipment to look really closely and then we're talking about the water "
3565,120.1,Jazmin,,"so why don't you go back to your passages and you know circle some or go back to the question and read it again and let me know if you have any questions ","i don't see anything that said discover in the story i'll look again teacher yes it's me student i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
3568,410.2,Jazmin,,"they did send a small machine to discover water on the moon but what was the name we're looking for more detail what was the name of the small machine ","oh i don't remember "
3571,430.2,Jazmin,,"we need to be a little more detailed we can't just say a microscope we can't just say a small machine you know a microscope is a small machine so we need to be a little more detailed and go back into the passage and highlight what they used to discover water on the moon ","okay so i have to say more details "
3576,420.3,Oliver,,"and as you're reading the passage you know might be good to take a highlighter and highlight keywords so when you go back you can look at what you highlighted to help you find the answers ","okay okay okay i'll try that because i still don't see on discover and here so i'll see what i find "
3578,210.4,Jazmin,,"Go back and, the second paragraph says NASA send a small machine. Well, which is what Jazmin read. But if you were to keep reading that sentence, it would tell you what the small machine was called that they sent to investigate. They sent a lunar orbiter to investigate. ","yeah i just found the name um and so i added i added the rest of that sentence to my answer so now my answer says nasa sent a small machine cutter lunar orbiter to investigate "
3581,150.1,Chris,,"so class else have any other questions ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
3584,120.4,Luis,,"let's look at your answer student ","yeah i talked about equipment in my answer "
3589,210.3,Luis,,"Okay, the oxygen tanks allows them to breathe better when they're on the moon. ","it does cause they can't breathe without oxygen tanks "
3592,130.3,Luis,,"so the question was you know they're trying they're going to need the oxygen tanks while they're on the moon but you're also going to need different equipment to discover water on the moon ","okay all right now i should say like scientists used a lot of ox used equipment like oxygen tanks and um and others equipment like i guess i could what student said and and the small machine to investigate to call it a lunar orbiter "
3595,420.2,Oliver,,"exactly exactly the more detail you have the better off your answer is ","i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go time for the next class so we'll see you later "
3598,420.2,Luis,,,"hi teacher can you see yes "
3602,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good yeah i'm doing pretty good you know what a long day "
3604,150.1,Luis,,"understand the question was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon and each one of you had different answers in your journals ","excuse me i'm a teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
3606,110.3,Luis,,"well that is wonderful student but we are still learning more information about space so we're going to teach our friends and so hopefully during the class if class else has questions maybe you can help me help them ","okay "
3617,210.2,Oliver,,"we're looking for a piece of equipment ","working for our equipment and for water "
3621,210.2,Oliver,,"the question was asking what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","Was covered water. "
3623,410.1,Farrah,,"Farrah. I'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly, you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. ","yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
3625,410.1,Farrah,,"student i'm not sure that maybe you understood the question correctly you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely well you do need a microscope to look really closely but this question is we're looking for the name of the piece of equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","but they said that you need the microscope to look at the water "
3633,120.3,Jazmin,,"says the orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater ","student that's where i got my answer from "
3635,120.3,Jazmin,,,"that's where i got my answer from that sentence at the beginning of the second paragraph "
3637,410.2,Jazmin,,"right nasa sent a small machine but you need more detail yes they did send a small machine but what was the name of this small machine ","um i think you just said the lunar orbiter "
3640,310.1,Farrah,,"i see where student could have got her answer it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look very closely ","yeah yeah that's where i got mine from "
3642,420.1,Farrah,,"right but if you go back and you reread the question again and you take out your highlighters and you go slowly you're looking for the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh and so like discover is not the same thing as as like to look at it "
3648,150.1,Chris,,"okay does class have any questions ","okay i guess it's not a question but i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
3652,110.2,Chris,,"yeah you're exactly right here so thank you for that added comment ","okay so i'm reading it now and the other thing i guess is that i don't see them talking about water in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter so how can that be the right one because they don't have discover in this one oh i do see look for ice "
3656,210.4,Chris,,"so this paragraph is talking about the water in space and what a valuable resource it is ","okay so me and student thought discover and looking at where it's the same thing and now okay yeah and i forgot to discover means to look for something and so i missed i missed that one in paragraph two "
3658,510.1,Chris,,"make sure when you're reading the passage you take a holiday you highlight important facts when you go to your question ","yeah i couldn't see how i missed that one um yeah okay "
3664,150.1,Oliver,,"does class understand now ","okay wow well teacher it's been a short time but thank you so much for working with us and i really appreciate how you asked us some questions so that we can think about how we got to our answers and then really explained our strategy where we really want to look closely at all of the words and the question and make sure we understand it because man to man i didn't realize that we we didn't understand exactly what discover man "
3666,150.1,Oliver,,,"you know "
3669,150.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
3671,150.1,Oliver,,,"we're excited to work with you "
3675,120.1,Luis,,"who can answer that question ","i i i really know like i don't think i need any help with this because i know like everything there is to know about space so i don't think i should be in this class "
3677,120.3,Luis,,"so tell us something that you learned from reading the text what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon ","wow like okay so they use like all kinds of equipment like they had to use like space suits and they had to use like you know all the stuff that astronauts have to use right "
3681,210.4,Luis,,"So it can deeper deepen your understanding about space. ","okay "
3684,130.2,Jazmin,,"so who can say what equipment was used to find water on the moon about the scientist ","and i thought it was a small machine "
3686,120.4,Jazmin,,"can you repeat that please ","yeah i thought it was a small machine "
3690,230.2,Oliver,,"do you remember what the small machine was called ","let me see i can't quite remember Um, so I circled the same thing as Farrah. And what I said was that it was basically people use the microscope. "
3694,130.2,Speaker,,"so student can you add to that ","well yeah so i was trying to figure out like was i guess i don't understand why my my answer was wrong because like was the microscope did they use the microscope because it seems like they did use the microscope "
3696,110.2,Chris,,"A microscope was used. There was other some other equipment also used so it's probably not just one piece of equipment ","yes so i was kind of thinking like um i was thinking that well i went to nasa and i know that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and maybe they use know that when they were finding like all that water in the craters "
3699,230.2,Jazmin,,"so student have you found some more details in the reading about what the machine was called ","and when i look back in i saw like what it what it said it said let me read it it said nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so was it the lunar orbiter "
3703,510.1,Bennett,,"so you see how if you did remember that it was a small machine and i like how you went back and reread your text to figure out what that machine was actually called ","i'm unfortunately we have to go to lunch so thank you so much for working with us but we have to go on to lunch let's see yes so we'll continue on and just continue the lesson where you left off using the moves that we talked about today and just see how it goes all right here we go "
3705,510.1,All,,,"or you're not able to see us "
3708,510.1,All,,,"you might have back into your zoom "
3711,510.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i i always have something interesting to share for sure i just wanted to say like my dad is an astronaut so again like i know all about this spot "
3716,120.4,Oliver,,"Oliver. Can you tell me ","um so i saw i listened to jazmin's answer she said that it was um the lunar orbiter i think "
3721,310.1,Jazmin,,"so great job class i like how class is reading their text and finding the details in the reading ","so my answer was sort of right and sort of wrong like when i said like nasa used a small machine like the initial one was was not quite right because i didn't say orbiters right "
3725,310.1,Bennett,,"it was the right answer but i like how you went back and read your text and offered more accurate details so you weren't wrong but by going back and rereading you are able to identify what the exact name of that machine was ","gotcha well we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and particularly i wanted to thank you for correcting me to look more closely at the work and really valuing the thinking that i was because i was thinking about it but i guess i didn't really realize how much was the complete answer that you really like helped me to see like how to look to see the text and how to really get a more complete answer that was really cool are yeah and i really appreciate that that you're so interested in my stories about like my dad and space and all that stuff so thank you so much welcome back so how did that feel "
3727,310.1,Oliver,,,"how are you today "
3730,310.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's the thing like um so i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all sorts of stuff about space already "
3732,310.1,Luis,,,"okay "
3735,310.1,Luis,,,"um so maybe i didn't really um look at the text i kind of just knew that "
3738,310.1,Luis,,,"Okay. "
3743,230.1,Oliver,,"can you elaborate a little more on your answer for what equipment did scientist used to discover water on the moon ","um yeah i can totally do that so i circled the same things as student and i said in paragraph three that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3746,210.4,Oliver,,"okay so if you can go back and let's look at paragraph number two it specifically talks about the exact equipment that the scientist used to investigate and find the water on the moon ","um i'm not sure "
3751,230.2,Jazmin,,"and i notice student said that nasa sent a small machine so student can you look back in the text and recall what was the name of that small machine that nasa sent ","i can do that i guess what i saw so nasa it's in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbitor to investigate so i guess it's the lunar orbiter right "
3756,310.1,Chris,,"exactly very good and nice job looking back at the text ","and i see that student answered that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and they did find that on the moon but what equipment student did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters well so that's kind of interesting like so i went to nasa with my dad like so yeah it was really awesome and like when we went there like they talked about how like that astronauts had to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff so s that the answer "
3761,230.2,Chris,,"And we were looking at paragraph two moment ago to specifically answer that question. So what was the name of the small machine that NASA sent to investigate? ","well i guess based on like jazmin's i guess the lunar orbiter "
3764,110.1,Chris,,"lunar orbiter that is correct ","i have a question okay "
3766,110.1,Farrah,,,"okay so i don't understand um can you help me understand why my answer's not correct "
3768,110.1,Farrah,,,"um it's student "
3772,150.1,Farrah,,"that make sense ","oh yeah that makes a lot of sense "
3775,150.1,Luis,,"does class else have questions ","i do i do i do student is yeah i have a question "
3780,150.1,Luis,,,"okay so actually um we have to go to lunch here in just a second but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher but you were so patient with us and also like i realized like i kind of just brought understanding like to the table but you like helped me to understand like like that i have to look at the text and that's really important so i really appreciate that because i don't always think that way so thank you for being so patient with us "
3786,120.4,Luis,,"awesome great student so i first want to start with student student could you read you me your answer ","yeah sure um mr teacher i shouldn't be on this class i don't already know all about space "
3788,110.1,Luis,,"well student why don't we why don't we listen to student answer and then we'll talk about your answer in just a minute okay ","okay "
3790,110.1,Farrah,,"okay yeah so just sit there and listen to student and then we'll get to you in just a sec all right go ahead student ","okay so um i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
3792,110.1,Luis,,"okay so that's a great point student can i help you ","nevermind i'll wait "
3795,120.3,Farrah,,"alright so let's read the question what does the question say ","um what equipment did telling us to discover water on the moon "
3798,120.1,Farrah,,"what does it say in the article about what machine or equipment went to the moon ","the microscope "
3803,120.3,Farrah,,"so in in paragraph two what does paragraph two say ","nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate looks for ice deposits large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small "
3806,210.4,Farrah,,"all right there you go you can stop there so what did they send to the moon to search for the water in the craters ","on the lunar orbiter "
3808,210.2,Farrah,,"Or what do they sent to investigate. ","oh they say simple lunar orbiter to investigate "
3811,120.1,Jazmin,,"alright so student let's get to you alright so read me your answer ","ah i'm sorry mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong too "
3814,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay student let's look at your your answer says nasa sent a small machine right ","yeah you just told student that was the right answer the lunar orbiter "
3820,210.3,Jazmin,,"well yeah cuz you think about like what use it uses talks about a microscope right and microscope is small right or it could it be talking about you know oxygen tank or i wanted to know specifically if you knew what equipment they used you know what i mean ","yeah that makes sense i understand "
3829,210.3,Luis,,"that needs to be clarified ","said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks I mean, they use oxygen tanks when they were on the moon. Um, I mean, that's what the story is about them going to the moon. Okay, well, okay, okay. In the first paragraph. It says, scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep in the moon's polar craters, and if they find that. "
3831,120.1,Luis,,"go ahead keep going ","then then that means that they had to go there in order to find it "
3834,120.3,Luis,,"the very first sentence ","nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay "
3836,210.4,Luis,,"so did the scientists go to the moon ","no "
3838,230.1,Luis,,"no right okay so where did you get oxygen takes from in your ","well cuz i i know a lot about space you know i i watched some tv shows and sometimes i'll watch nova on youtube "
3841,230.2,Luis,,"so where in the article doesn't talk about oxygen tanks ","it doesn't "
3844,120.1,Jazmin,,"that doesn't alright so how so how would you rephrase your your answer ","um okay um so the scientists sent what the name of the thing lunar orbiter "
3846,110.4,Luis,,"there you go yep ","ok ok so scientists sent the lunar orbiter to the moon "
3848,210.3,Luis,,"to do what ","to discover water "
3855,130.3,Chris,,"that is the equipment that they used all right ","mr teacher i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and i guess the lunar orbiter too Well, like even just said they use the Lunar Orbiter. "
3859,210.4,Oliver,,"right they just use the lunar orbiter so yes they may use all that equipment but they didn't send astronauts they sent a lunar orbiter ","yeah yeah yeah well i was just looking at the clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch but thanks for taking the time to work with us okay "
3864,120.2,Luis,,"so the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut "
3868,120.4,Jazmin,,"will you read your answer for me please ","okay so i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
3872,130.1,Jazmin,,"Oh that is obviously a true statement. Right. You can't live without water. ","is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
3874,120.2,Jazmin,,"okay so is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable is there convincing evidence that it could be valuable on the moon ","well um it says that there's water on the moon and what is valuable because you need it to drink "
3878,210.4,Jazmin,,"So there's no water on the moon, then what are they in order for astronauts to go to the moon and have water, what do they need to do? ","if there's no water in the mud in order for them to go to the moon they'd have to bring their own water "
3881,210.4,Jazmin,,"in paragraph four what does it talk about regarding water ","water on the moon can be valuable i mean when we say it can be useful in lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water yes see that's where i got my "
3883,120.3,Jazmin,,"keep reading what does the next one say ","okay i'm water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
3885,120.1,Jazmin,,"all right so why is it valuable to find water on the moon ","because it would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
3887,210.4,Jazmin,,"well and what does it say about the weight of water ","it says that water is heavy you know i also know you can use water to grow things so we can have like a moon garden on the on the moon "
3889,140.1,Jazmin,,"you like the martian ","i like that movie "
3893,140.1,Jazmin,,"yeah it's a good movie ","um okay so i can say i should ask and drink the water you can't survive without water having water on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft water is heavy "
3895,130.2,Chris,,"Okay, so let's speaking of waters heavy. Let's go to Chris's answer okay there's you said water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it. ","so if if you don't have to carry the water then you could have room on the ship for some other stuff that you wanted to carry "
3897,210.3,Chris,,"okay do you think do you think take off for a spaceship could be easier without the weight of the water ","well i know that like weight matters because like when we get on the airplane you know they weigh our suitcases and so um but i know that rocket ships go out into space and there isn't any arm gravity in space so "
3900,210.1,Chris,,"so if your rocket doesn't weigh as much and it'll probably be a little easier for the rocket to get into outer space correct ","yeah yeah yeah yeah "
3905,110.1,Chris,,"okay your answer no it's not ready yet ","sorry teacher i just i just thought of one more thing yes that i had read also that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
3909,230.1,Oliver,,"alright so student will you explain your answer for me ","yeah sure okay so um i said no it's not ready yet because last paragraph they talking about how hard it will be and how it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so it doesn't look like they're ready to pick up any of the water from the moon yeah "
3912,120.2,Oliver,,"What is the question. The question is, is there convincing evidence that water on the moon to be valuable. Right. ","Well, I said no, there isn't any evidence because they haven't been able to get to the moon to find evidence because it's gonna take a lot of time and money. "
3916,210.3,Oliver,,"hold on you just said they haven't been to the moon yet ","i don't think so Oh yeah, we talked about the the lunar orbiter all yeah cuz they sent the machine there. "
3920,210.4,Oliver,,"that's what it says in verse in section two ","right like like i remember okay "
3927,130.2,Oliver,,"and Farrah, you can help out too. ","Okay. okay why would it be valuable okay okay in paragraph five it says moon water it could be useful and other ways or it can be broken down into two parts that's what i said hydrogen and oxygen and oh okay astronauts could breathe oxygen but that's not water that's oxygen "
3930,210.4,Farrah,,"so it says that water is broken down into two parts ","yeah so they could breathe the oxygen part of the water "
3933,130.2,Luis,,"student what else is to say that oxygen hydrogen could be used as ","it sounds like that could be used as rocket fuel "
3935,210.3,Luis,,"yeah so how would that be a valuable resource to have ","well i mean like if i needed fuel to get back home and they could like make the fuel i guess on the moon and have it be like a gas station so they could fly back home "
3938,210.1,Jazmin,,"okay so then that means that they have less gas when they start right when they take off from earth ","cuz cuz you were telling student that if it's too heavy well it's better to be light so if they have less gas when they take off then they have their lighter and they can go faster "
3942,110.4,Oliver,,"there you go and it's a lot easier to get out into space ","you can break it up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen we can breathe oxygen "
3944,110.4,Luis,,,"and and we can make they can make rocket fuel with it "
3948,110.2,Farrah,,"a garden okay yes ","i don't remember the other thing it was the thing that you said student it's it's it if you if you can get water up there then you don't have to take it with you i guess "
3950,210.3,Farrah,,"okay and so what is i mean what is water essential for ","to drink or bath "
3952,210.3,Farrah,,"right well yeah take it literally essentially central to take a bath right it's essential to drink water ","yeah "
3955,110.1,Oliver,,"right so okay awesome yes student ","i'm trying my supporting but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go but i did want to say that i appreciate it how you kept asking about why we were making the senators like you asked me why did i say nothing and i then it helped me kind of think about what i found in the story for my answer "
3957,110.1,Oliver,,,"i appreciate you "
3960,110.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you "
3963,150.1,Luis,,"great well so do you class had an opportunity to review the discussion question ","oh yeah so we all looked at that question and so we shared our answers but here's the thing like i don't think i need to be in this class because like i already know all about space so i don't like i don't need to like be like learn more i already know about it "
3965,230.1,Luis,,"okay that's great that's a great you know comment i would ask you what what do you think your question what do you think the question is asking you ","wow okay so ah the question is what equipment did like scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3967,120.4,Luis,,"okay and what was your answer ","so i said like they need like all the oxygen tanks and they like you know they need like all that stuff that like astronauts used to like go fly around in space "
3971,210.3,Luis,,"okay well did you read the the article that was with the question ","maybe i didn't really read it Okay. Okay, so paragraph two NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. "
3974,210.3,Luis,,,"okay this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water "
3977,120.1,Luis,,"and again student what was the question ","um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3981,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay so from the article what equipment did did the scientists use to discover water ","um like jazmin's answer the small machine okay and student what was the small machine called ok so after we just read it the small machine is called a lunar orbiter "
3983,150.1,Luis,,"great great great answer so student do you think from your question from your answer to your question that you think that you needed to revise that question or the answer ","yeah i didn't really read it the first time so yeah i think that i see i think i understand like why that's that might be a better answer "
3985,150.1,Farrah,,,"yes okay so like um i didn't understand like maybe you can help me understand like why my answer is wrong "
3987,150.1,Farrah,,,"okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to investigate "
3989,210.3,Farrah,,"okay what is the question asking us ","the question sayas what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
3993,210.4,Farrah,,"okay and what equipment did you find from the article that you read and that student just read and in paragraph two what did the article tell you about what the scientists used to find water on the moon ","i guess like student and jazmin's answer was the lunar orbiter but like is like microscope is that equipment too did they discover it with the microscope "
3996,130.3,Farrah,,"microscopes are used for to find tiny tiny organisms underneath right to magnify it to make it bigger and we didn't use a microscope to go and look for you know water on the moon we used the lunar orbiter which was able to be controlled from you know from the earth ","oh ok i see "
3998,130.3,Farrah,,,"so they discovered it "
4001,210.3,Oliver,,"now student i have a question for you you said i circled the same as student did you actually read the article ","um i did read the article and i did circle the same thing though like a section in paragraph three about like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but i heard what student was saying about and why you're saying like the dhe difference between like like looking at something and finding or discovering it "
4005,410.2,Oliver,,"the thing that troubles me with your answer is that you said the same as student which shows me that you're either looking at farrah's paper or you didn't have your own idea ","okay "
4009,130.3,Chris,,"and so in this case case in this case the machine they're using is a lunar orbiter ","um yeah so like like here's the thing like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and like stuff like that so like is that possibly an answer i went to nasa with my dad "
4018,210.2,Luis,,"the keyword discover water on the moon right the key phrase there and so we're not looking for just any scientific equipment that it's used out in space we're looking for this specific one this article says discovered the water on the moon which in this case like student and student had said is the lunar orbiter ","um yeah so basically okay so i just we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to like thank you real quick like for working with us today and like like i wanted to thank you for like helping us to listen to each other like sometimes we kind of don't like listen to each other very well and we kind of make like our science teacher gets kind of frustrated but you are really patient and like asking i still listen to each other's answers and i think i think there was a lot to learn from that and that was pretty cool so like just wanted to thank you for like doing that and like taking that time for us to do that "
4022,210.2,Oliver,,,"we're happy to see you "
4024,210.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and outer space and and craft that fly into space "
4034,120.4,Luis,,"Okay, okay. Now who wants to share with me. What words did you choose what words from the question. Did you circle. Yes. Luis ","um yeah so i guess i was wondering like i think i know the words but i was wondering about like discover "
4036,110.1,Oliver,,"okay the word this cover okay let me hear some other ideas what word did you choose student ","so what i chose i think i know the words but i was wondering about equipment because i basically said the same thing as student what was that it was the microscope "
4038,110.1,Farrah,,"okay very good student and what about you ","oh yeah i had the same answer as student "
4040,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay very good so two words that we have identified so far student did you find a word ","i actually feel like i knew what each of the words meant "
4042,110.1,Chris,,"okay very good all right now and student the you know the defining the words that you're not sure of ","not like i really love space and my dad has taken me to nasa before so i think i know the words pretty well "
4045,130.2,Oliver,,"all right very good so i want you to talk to each other in your groups and i'm going to ask student student and student to be in one class and student and student ","so student i think that basically you know that we like equipment is like the tool or something that you use "
4049,120.4,Jazmin,,"is from the other class wants to share which word did you discuss ","so basically we said like what was that we talked about the different machines that people would say okay people would use and so i was wondering cuz i was like confused why my answer was wrong "
4056,210.2,Oliver,,"You know what the word discover means? Yes Oliver? ","and discover is like when you find something "
4058,110.4,Oliver,,"very good ","like like yeah when you find it "
4062,110.1,Chris,,"sorry i'm student you said microscope right ","i also said microscope right yeah "
4066,110.1,Chris,,,"Um, well, I was just thinking that some other tools were like, because I went to NASA. And I saw that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that. So did they use those things? "
4074,120.3,Farrah,,"Okay, can you read the sentence at the word machine comes in Farrah. ","oh yeah i can do that okay so basically it's nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
4076,210.4,Farrah,,"all right very good so the word machine is in that sentence right now what we're looking for is the machine or the tool what was used to find the water now what tool is mentioned in that sentence ","the lunar orbiter "
4079,210.4,Oliver,,"very good and which word in that sentence tells us that they actually find the water ","um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i think that will have a chance to see you after lunch so we have to run really quick "
4081,210.4,Jazmin,,,"hey can you see us "
4084,210.4,Jazmin,,,"you might have to close the zoom window or move it out of the way or maybe move your internet browser out of the way "
4089,220.1,Luis,,"and so we had left of where we were trying to actually locate the answer from the passage so we are going to just briefly recap that we were looking at the word yes student ","um yeah so i just wanted to say my dad is an astronaut so i think that could be kind of helpful "
4093,210.2,Jazmin,,"okay now we were looking at the word discover right and we said the word is what does the word discover mean ","so discover means like to find something or to you know investigate like the way that nasa use the small machine to get to the water "
4095,210.4,Jazmin,,"right and what machine did we identify that was used ","it was the lunar orbiter "
4100,210.4,Jazmin,,"very good and there was another word in that sentence that you read that also will give us a clue of the word discover do you know what that word is ","You find something? Look for it? "
4103,210.4,Jazmin,,"there's a word in the sentence can you can you go back to that sentence for me the sentence that talked about the lunar orbiter look at that sentence for me is there another word in that sentence that helps us to know that we actually are discovering something so what do you have to do to discover ","is it investigate "
4110,210.2,Oliver,,"and as we said the word discover means to find so yes truth ","i'm actually i'm sorry we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for working with us and what was really special when you are working with us is that you really help us to understand the meaning of the word discover because we didn't totally understand when we started but now we all know what discover meets and not just that but you helped us use evidence from the text you made sure that we were using information from the text and not just stuff that we knew from like our background so that was really awesome thank you so much for working with us "
4114,210.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing well how are you "
4116,210.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so i don't know if like i should really be in this class because i know like all about space and like i know all this stuff so like i don't know that i should really have to work on it "
4124,120.2,Jazmin,,"what took equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon ","i think we did yeah yeah i think we did "
4127,120.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i think so "
4130,210.2,Oliver,,"alright is there class who wants to share the answer with us what is what does the word equipment means yes student ","um yeah so equipment is like something that you you like use to accomplish a task like it's something like a machine or like a tool that you use to do something "
4136,120.4,Farrah,,"All right, anybody wants to share that. What does that mean yes Farrah? ","so like discover so like discover is that's where you you find something "
4140,150.1,Farrah,,"right you find something do you agree with that class ","um i think that i think that you were just about to say this but i am not quite sure why maybe it's serious wrong because i think it's the microscope "
4143,230.1,Farrah,,"okay um now what did they say the microscope was used for ","i'm like in the reading "
4145,230.1,Farrah,,"in the passage yes what does the word what what was a microscope used to do ","okay so um let's see in paragraph three they said the water they found is microscopic me wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4148,210.3,Farrah,,"does that mean they already find the water ","oh you mean "
4154,230.1,Oliver,,"did they use a microscope to find the water ","oh like like oh like your mean like the difference between like finding it and like like looking at it they said, what did they use to find it. "
4159,150.1,Jazmin,,"exactly so not what they used to look at it so i wanted to go back is there class else who wants to share on that and that issue ","I realized that based on what they're saying, the small machine, I think was the thing that I think this small machine is what found that water. In paragraph two, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4161,210.4,Jazmin,,"exactly to investigate investigate means what ","look for "
4164,110.4,Chris,,"right student means to look for right or to discover as as the question asked you yes student ","um yeah i was just kind of wondering like so i went to nasa with my dad and we had a chance to like look at all the displays all the rockets and stuff so like i know that scientists like have to use lots of equipment but but i was thinking that they used equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that "
4167,210.1,Chris,,"right they use different equipment right but remember you're looking at the the passage right but a question actually relates to the passage so what we want to do is to find the equipment that was mentioned in the passage right student ","yeah yeah oh "
4170,210.1,Chris,,,"Yeah, the lunar orbiter "
4178,110.3,Jazmin,,"see so that's where you find your answer okay so always remember that you have a lot of experience ","So, we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say really quickly i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for like you were so patient with us like sometimes we can frustrate our science teacher and you were so patient and you help us to really listen to each other and like help build our answers like off one another and that was really cool cuz cuz that doesn't always happen and also you were really careful about like the answer to the question and like helping us break down the words to be honestly sometimes we don't read as carefully as we could so you really helped us to read carefully i just want to thank you "
4182,110.3,Luis,,,"oh hi um i just was gonna say that um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
4185,110.3,Luis,,"knowledge and help us expand our learning on space ","i can do that "
4190,120.2,Chris,,"so i just reviewed your answers for what told it scientists use to find locate water on the moon ","um yeah so i did a look i think so i'm going to guess that i didn't you were saying i didn't answer the question right because the question was how did the scientists what equipment did the scientists use to discover water and i just was talking about the creative right right "
4193,120.4,Jazmin,,"student refresh my memory what was your answer ","to be connected with that they use a small machine "
4197,150.1,Jazmin,,"our high quality answer can be found in the text yes student well ","i guess ever since you were we were talking i was just wonder like i guess still not sure like my my answer "
4211,120.3,Farrah,,"okay so let's read straight from the text let's go student ","um okay so should i should do the part that i circled yes okay basically so okay what i was circling was i still stuck on the microscope and i can i can tell you why i said it like because it says it's a scientific to exit and then i circled like small machine because i think that was jazzmines answer and and it sounds like that might also be it but i guess i'm thinking that okay so it's both the small machine and and the microscope "
4214,120.4,Oliver,,"okay it can be at oliveron what did you circle the ","one pretty much the same thing i i just start called the microscope again because i still think that that was what they used to you know to to discover it like when they were discovering the water like how could they discover it if you can't see yet and they said that the ice was microscope "
4218,110.1,Luis,,"okay alright so let's find out ","um so i basically when i went in i circle lunar orbiter and microscope "
4223,130.3,Jazmin,,"the lunar ","orbiter the lunar orbiter "
4229,150.1,Farrah,,"student any you look a little little stunned is there something i can help you with ","with you up me "
4231,150.1,Farrah,,,"oh this is student "
4240,150.1,Farrah,,,"no that's okay sometimes i can have a voice that sounds like the voice so um yeah basically i guess i think i understand so okay so in the in the question like we restate the question it's like scientists use the you know a particular equipment to to find the water on the moon and i guess so i can understand that i guess i'm still wondering like is like okay so it sounds like jazmin's answer was was the right answer is is the microscope like do we say both of them or do we say like student "
4242,130.3,Farrah,,"you say both of them because the lunar orbiter had the microscope on it ","oh interesting okay gotcha so like you would say both okay interesting way "
4245,420.2,Oliver,,"any misconceptions ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but thanks so much for working with us it was really want to work "
4247,420.2,Oliver,,,"was great thank you "
4249,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astral which is pretty cool "
4255,110.1,Jazmin,,"that is cool ","that with the small machine that they use to discover the you know what i mean they said that that was it so i think it's really important that with "
4258,310.1,Chris,,"that is a very good answer you remembered from your text and you elaborated by restating the question thank you ","well i was gonna say lunar orbiter as well and i changed my because you asked us to look at the text and not like necessarily background now even though i know that like they use lots of other stuff it's clear that you know what i mean that the lunar orbiter is is in the text so i guess i wasn't quite sure i didn't quite catch student and but it sounds like it was important to rephrase it "
4266,230.3,Oliver,,"to restate the question to the form your answer yes ","you want me to ask a question about the text um so i guess like one question i have so i'm still a little torn about the microscope um i guess the question i have is that in the text right they say don't in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close i guess i'm wondering like you know like how did they find um well it's kind of confusing as they say like you wouldn't be able to see it unless you are looking straight at it or even if you were looking straight at it so like what did they use the microscope for "
4272,130.2,Farrah,,"that is a very good question to class class wants to help him out and answer why would they put a microscope along with the lunar orbiter ","well i think that that's where they said you know you have to look really close that catches so if they put it on the lunar orbit that they still found it using it sounds like something else so they don't say it the texts like if it's if it's true or something they're like they just say it's a lunar orbit so i think i think that's the best answer because i think i feel like i'm getting "
4280,520.1,Jazmin,,"okay so from reading the text today and using our tools by going back and rereading the text and circling important information how can this broaden your understanding in the future of any topic that we discuss whether it's space or farming ","student do you think the state but basically one thing i would say just that to farrah's queestion they use the lunar orbiter to get to the war like you can't find it with the microscope you have to you have to find you have to discover it so and then use the like what we would use like so i think what i would use is basically like we have to close it right and then we have to restate the question which is really hard you know "
4284,420.2,Jazmin,,"So just with write down the question and then use them. The words on your paper or on your iPad. You can just rearrange them to restate the question. ","can you show us "
4290,110.1,Oliver,,"i can ","um i don't i'm not sure now i'm really interested in in learning how to do that question Yeah. "
4294,110.1,,,,"oh i don't think you can share the screen i "
4296,110.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
4300,510.1,Oliver,,"to answer the question using the race method you restate the question ","um well it sounds like the lunar orbiter is the right answer and even if i'm not totally 100 sure why so you would say scientists use the lunar orbit "
4302,130.3,Oliver,,"to discover water on the moon ","scientists use the lunar orbiter oh okay yeah so scientists to the question is like how what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and you say like right back scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
4307,520.1,Luis,,"how can you use your knowledge of restating the question in our next lesson ","it's a good question well the first thing i would do is i would restate the question i would say like okay so if the question asked this then i got it i got to answer that question because my response didn't really answer the question i was saying like the scientists found craters below water so it didn't really answer what you asked so i guess it might answer can't answer the question then it's like okay like that's not the answer you know what i mean "
4317,110.4,Oliver,,"was that you that is absolutely correct ","so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we do i really wanted to thank you for working and like in particular i wanted to thank you for like being really clear about like why you were concerned about like what were the things that you you know what i mean like what you wanted us to be focused on and like where we were focused instead and that was really clear and and you also gave us like class or how to like improve our answer you know what i mean like you gave us a lot of ways that we could make our answers better like both being more accurate but then also like you know like restating the question that a lot of booze and be found like just saying the question back because then things make make more sense you know what i mean so it was really cool working with you and you are also so patient with like student who can be kind of like says a lot of crazy things so thank you so much "
4320,110.4,Oliver,,,"hi "
4323,110.4,Chris,,,"hi how are you "
4325,110.4,Chris,,,"doing well thank you "
4327,110.4,Luis,,,"it was fun but i have a question "
4329,110.4,Luis,,,"um i don't think that i should be in this class like i already know all about space and like everything there is to know i don't think i need any help "
4331,120.4,Luis,,"so what was your answer to the question what tool did the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","well i was saying that the scientists would have to use like i'm like spacesuits and that they would need like rocket fuel and they would need oxygen and like all that stuff that i already know before like ever doing the reading "
4334,110.3,Farrah,,"oh okay so you have some prior knowledge of space travel right ","um so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely "
4336,110.1,Oliver,,"that's very good student ","i answered the same as student "
4338,110.1,Chris,,"and student how did you enter the question ","so i went to nasa so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff like i already know about all that stuff "
4340,110.1,Jazmin,,"great okay and student ","so i said that nasa used like a small machine "
4344,210.4,Farrah,,"now student student and student read paragraph two as well and see what extra equipment or what kinds of equipment could narrow this down ","okay we read through it but um i have a question if that's okay "
4346,210.4,Farrah,,,"so my answer about the microscope i just i'm not quite understanding why my answer is wrong "
4350,210.4,Jazmin,,"but what was in paragraph two in the very first sentence let's see if we can find exactly what they used ","okay so it says um it says on paragraph in paragraph two "
4352,210.4,Jazmin,,,"it says basically that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4354,210.4,Chris,,,"um well i just i feel like we're talking about stuff that that we know like cuz i went to nasa with my dad and i feel like we're missing stuff that like we have to use "
4357,120.1,Jazmin,,"keep reading see what else you can discover ","so it's the lunar orbiter "
4362,110.4,Chris,,"mhmm it's the lunar orbiter that they sent to look for the water ","well i was going to answer the earlier question i know where they found the water "
4364,110.4,Farrah,,,"so i was gonna say um so did they use the the microscope to discover the water as well or did they use it for something else "
4366,230.2,Farrah,,"okay from your text it says that you would need what to see the water ","a microscope "
4368,110.1,Chris,,"there you go okay student what did you want to add ","um so i was just gonna say like that basically i can understand so like the lunar orbiter is the machine that like went up there like student said did they have astronauts in it did they need all that stuff "
4370,210.4,Chris,,"it did not clarify did it so maybe this could have been an unmanned mission and they just send the machinery and the lunar orbiter was part of the bigger machine that discovered the water ","yeah that makes sense that makes sense okay so maybe they didn't send any astronauts at all "
4372,210.3,Oliver,,"there you go okay so student where were they finding this water ","um so they found the water in polar craters "
4374,140.1,Oliver,,"in polar crater so what does that mean is it around the earth or is it the top and the bottom ","um it's at the top and the bottom "
4376,210.4,Oliver,,"okay that's what polar craters mean polar means the poles the north and the south so what is the main idea of this section what is for informational texts what is the main idea what is the target they want you to know ","um do you mean for the the three paragraphs or in one paragraph "
4378,210.4,Oliver,,,"well i guess the central idea is that um the water is that there's water on the moon and the lunar orbiter found it and the microscope was used to look at it "
4380,110.1,Oliver,,"there you go great job class so each ","awesome "
4382,110.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i do like i feel like maybe like i kind of jumped the gun like i kind of was saying like you know i know all this stuff but didn't really read the text so i feel like now i understand a little better "
4388,110.1,Jazmin,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for for being so patient as we all work together and for helping us to listen to each other's answers and kind of use each other's answers to help our own answers sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and it was really special to be able to work with you and to have you encouraged us to listen to each other so um i really appreciate that and i think class else does "
4391,120.4,Luis,,"okay student let's look at your answer that you gave yes student ","i do have a question so um here's what i was thinking um i know like a lot about space like practically everything that you can know about space i don't really think i need any help i don't think i should be in this class "
4393,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay student let's hold on just a second keep your thoughts just for a moment let's student let's go back to each for just a minute tell me about your answer ","well what i read was in paragraph two and it said in the first paragraph that nasa sent a small machine "
4395,120.3,Jazmin,,"okay so class look at your paper let's look at paragraph two student can you just read that for me again what did you just just read it one more time for me ","sure okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater should i keep reading "
4399,120.1,Chris,,"would you like to look at your answer that you wrote for the question and see if you want to change that answer ","um well like i guess i guess no cuz like i guess the lunar orbiter landed in one of the craters that was full of water "
4404,120.4,Jazmin,,"how did you answer the question again ","so i said that nasa sent a small machine and then when i was reading i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
4406,210.4,Chris,,"Luis, can you tell me about the lunar orbiter. Go back to paragraph two. Luis, you go ahead and look at paragraph two. ","yeah no problem "
4410,110.1,Luis,,"student can you hold that thought for just one moment ","Um, okay. So lunar orbiter. the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so like that's what the lunar orbiter does it flies up and it orbits the moon "
4414,210.4,Luis,,"So do you think the Lunar Orbiter was able to see the ice deposits or what how do you think the lunar orbiter was able to find the ice deposits? ","like maybe it had like instruments on board like it had like very scientific instruments "
4416,110.1,Farrah,,"that's a good answer student what would you like to add to the conversation ","okay so i thought that it's the microscope that discovered the water but um i i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i thought the microscope discovered it and also the yeah i thought the microscope discovered the water "
4418,230.2,Farrah,,"okay so you're you want to talk the microscope what paragraph does our reading talk about the microscope ","okay so it's paragraph three and it says the water is the water they found is microscopic um and then you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4420,210.4,Farrah,,"okay does it say the microscope found the water in that paragraph ","no i guess not "
4422,110.1,Chris,,"okay harisson what you had your question a question just a few minutes ago what was that question that you had ","well i guess i was just wondering kind of i mean kind of like student like i don't know like i went to nasa with my dad and like we basically like went and studied all the exhibits and stuff so like i just know like outside of the reading that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that stuff "
4426,120.3,Oliver,,"and that they use equipment to search for things so when you look back at your reading student can can you look back at your reading in paragraph two and read that one more time for us okay ","sure okay so paragraph two um let's see which part just like the whole one "
4428,120.3,Oliver,,"the whole thing a paragraph two ","okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one "
4431,210.4,Oliver,,"let's go back to paragraph two once more it does say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think the word investigate means ","oh like to look at to like look for something "
4434,130.2,Jazmin,,"to look for something to what do you do you have anything else student student or student or student to add to that investigate means what what does that mean to you ","so i think if you're investigating it's like how you're finding something so you went off and looked for something "
4443,210.4,Oliver,,"so if you're investigating something you're finding something so what are you going to find about it once you find it what else are you going to want to know about it ","well i guess you know what it is is it water And so I guess like that's where basically like investigate can you find it, but also study it, but you have to find it and then study So what I wanted to add was just that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us. that sometimes we can really frustrate our science teacher but like you were so patient with like student i don't think student did the reading so i think like it was really nice like how patient you were and like how you like brought all of our answers together so that we could better understand each other that was really cool so thank you because it was really nice to be with my classmates we don't always get along "
4448,120.4,Luis,,"student student what did you want to ask first ","um well i was just gonna say that i kind of know like all about space i don't think i need to be in this class "
4454,120.3,Luis,,"and then i would like for you to read to yourself silently just passed the word machine what actually let's have student read that sentence for us ","okay so um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4457,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay that sentence so what did nasa send to investigate ","they sent the lunar orbiter "
4459,120.2,Jazmin,,"the lunar orbiter ok so our question that we had what equipment did scientist us to discover water on the moon what do you think they sent ","a scientist sent the orbiter to discover water on the moon "
4462,110.1,Chris,,"that is correct they did send that ","oh i was just gonna say the same thing "
4464,120.3,Oliver,,"okay so let's look down the next sentence past that one can you read the next sentence for me student ","the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
4467,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so what did the lunar orbiter do who can tell me ","so the lunar orbiter landed at the south pole and it looks for ice water "
4469,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so ice and water is that the same thing yes student ","it's it's the same thing it's just that ice is frozen water and i guess i just i wanted to ask i think i'm still a little bit confused about why my answer is wrong "
4472,230.1,Farrah,,"okay so you your answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope scope to look really closely so i can what made you say that ","well it says it says in the question that they're looking for the equipment that was used to discover so i said okay the keyword is equipment and discover and i thought what's equipment and i saw the microscope and i know that you use the microscope to see stuff and they said the water was microscopic so you couldn't see without the microscope so i was thinking like you have to see it to find it you know what i mean "
4477,210.3,Farrah,,"but did the microscope actually find the water ","oh i guess i guess not cause it didn't say that they found it with the microscope it sounds like they found it with something else with the lunar orbiter right "
4481,210.4,Chris,,"and then the second sentence underline that one as well this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits ok now let's go on to the third paragraph ","um well actually it was more of a question "
4483,210.4,Chris,,,"yeah i guess it was that i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists like oxygen tanks at masks and suits and stuff and i was wondering like that wasn't in the reading and i was wondering like did they use that to find the water "
4489,410.3,Farrah,,"you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely there's where student found her answer but the microscope was just to be able to see the water after they found it we're back to number two ","the lunar orbiter "
4491,110.1,Farrah,,"exactly exactly ","and i'm so sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with thank you "
4495,120.2,Luis,,"okay so our second question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","um yeah well i was just gonna say that like i think i kind of got all this figured out by now so i think i'm good "
4499,150.1,Luis,,"okay i appreciate that that you that you feel that way but let's talk about this for just a minute ","so okay so my response was that water can be split into two parts at the hydrogen and oxygen "
4506,420.2,Luis,,"how would you use that answer to convince me that water is valuable or could be valuable on the moon ","so like i didn't well i guess like that it would be valuable because you could use all those things like hydrogen you can use for rocket fuel and oxygen you can use to breathe Yeah, well, I think so. it sounds like i should say like what it does so that you know people understand like what like you know like what i'm trying to say so i guess i didn't have like a complete answer "
4509,120.3,Luis,,"great response so let's go back to and i think you pulled that right out of paragraph five can you read that this the first two sentences on paragraph five for me student ","oh yeah absolutely okay so paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
4511,120.3,Luis,,"okay and what else does it say about it ","um well it says that like get astronauts could read the oxygen and then oxygen and hydrogen oh they use both for rocket fuel "
4513,210.4,Luis,,"okay so you said they could use it for rocket fuel but what other thing did it say right there where you just read ","they could breathe it "
4516,110.4,Jazmin,,"they could breathe it ","and i just i'm still kind of confused about how to how to structure the answer so that it's a better answer "
4518,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay so your answer tell me what your answer was again ","yeah so my answer was that yes there's convincing evidence because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
4525,210.3,Jazmin,,"so okay so are those reasons that it could be valuable ","i think it's valuable yeah i think i was just wondering like if if i know that it's valuable like how do i structure like my answer it how do i say the answer so that it uses evidence you were reminding us to use evidence did i do it right or do i need to adjust it "
4530,420.2,Jazmin,,"perhaps you could have worded it by saying water is valuable or could be valuable ","i can read it to you is that helpful "
4533,420.2,Jazmin,,,"of course the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
4535,420.2,Chris,,,"what i was ok so i was i read that they were possibly going to have a base on the moon by 2024 which i think that could be really useful "
4537,210.3,Chris,,"okay art so did you read that in our paragraph or did you listen did you hear that somewhere else ","oh i i heard that somewhere else "
4545,430.3,Oliver,,"okay so you might be confusing your prior knowledge that you may have gotten somewhere else with with what we read in our paragraph so let's think about what we just read in our paragraph to answer our question ","um well i actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using evidence and really helping us to clarify like what we were thinking and and like what kind of ideas perhaps like you really help us to sort of think about like like how did we come to this answer and by thinking about like that you helped us to make like such better answers and like i think that class had a deeper understand like don't you agree class like i think class agrees that like class like you know what i mean understand better and like especially with like student just now like it was really cool how you were asking him like you know like how did he come to his answer so i think student like understand even more and i know that i like was really interested in that conversation so thank you so much for working with us "
4548,430.3,Jazmin,,,"we're really excited to see "
4550,430.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
4559,150.1,Farrah,,"stick around yes we're going to talk about our corrected answers ","okay so basically what i did so good my initial answer was scientists use the lunar orbiter nope sorry you need a scientist tool for the microscope to look really looks and then i said after after class with you i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon and so i did that because you help me understand that the scientific tool that it with the microscope was not the equipment they use to discover the walk so after we work together i realized that it was the lunar orbit that helped to discover "
4564,210.2,Jazmin,,"student what does discover mean ","i'm discovering like when you find them but like it's when you find them for the first time "
4570,510.1,Jazmin,,"remember when we are reading our question we have to look really closely at those keywords those words that we need to look for in our text ","i started a couple things like i changed my answer to so basically i was like at first i said this small ship for nasa and option but then you helped us look at like how we needed to use the question and like use that to answer it so i'd said basically that like scientists for nasa us the lunar orbit to discover water on the because the lunar orbiter is the equipment that takes you know what i mean like and that was more accurate like i kind of had it right but i didn't i didn't say the actual equipment and they were asked like the name "
4580,130.2,Farrah,,"so what is a word in our texts that might help someone else answer the question what do you think student what might help your friend ","so i basically so i was thinking about what word is like discover so i i found that the word okay so it says like in paragraph two it says nasa set this ball she called the lunar orbiter to best which is kind of like dis discover yeah don't let go and find something and so i thought investigate was important because basically like you know what i mean it says like that's what they that that's what they discover and then when i was looking at the microscope originally i was like oh that's because they had to look really closely but they had to look closely like after they found right "
4583,110.4,Chris,,"yes awesome job ","well i actually have a question "
4586,110.4,Chris,,,"my question was like okay so i know because i went so with like that that scientists use oxygen tanks and stuff you know what i mean equipment like that because i was wondering like that's not in the reading like did they leave it out or you know what i mean like is that is that right or is that just like i guess i don't want to understand "
4590,410.1,Chris,,"they weren't really thinking about what they use to actually get to space so yes you're right they did use the oxygen tanks and things like that because there is no oxygen in space but they were focusing more on the water piece versus what they use to get to space ","because it's it's not in the right so even if it was true right okay "
4594,150.1,Oliver,,"sometimes they don't put everything in the reading because then we would be reading forever ","i'm so sorry but we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you for working with us it was really awesome to have a chance to talk so thank you so much "
4597,150.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut just pretty cool "
4604,210.2,Oliver,,"so we know that there is water on the moon that the scientists had discovered it but our question says is there evidence that the water could be valuable okay so what do we think valuable means ","i think valuable means like useful it can also mean like you know like something that costs a lot like it could be really expensive "
4610,210.2,Luis,,"You think yes or no. ","um yeah so basically well i guess okay so you're asking is it useful well water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and in oxygen and those are both really useful in space so yeah i think it's us "
4614,230.1,Luis,,"okay what are you going to use the hydrogen and oxygen for ","um i'm like whoa okay didn't say it i don't remember mike my dad uses it or something okay did he say oh oh oh you could you could breathe breathe the oxygen "
4617,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what do you think ","um to basically we is it the answer to the question or like why are you "
4619,120.4,Jazmin,,"yes so do you think water could be useful ","oh yeah i think it would be really because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water also you could use the order that they have and you could grow a garden all over the moon "
4623,120.4,Chris,,"student what do you think do you think water could be valuable from the moon ","i'm yeah i mean yeah like water is heavy and so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships like they don't have to carry any water they could just go to the moon and get the water there "
4626,230.3,Oliver,,"that is very true yes water is heavy so it would be good that if they didn't have to carry it on the ship they could have room for other things so that is very good thinking ","um okay so i was thinking that no and mostly because it's not it's not ready "
4631,230.1,Oliver,,"okay what do you mean by that ","um well i guess the waters not like it's not like immediately ready to use like they were saying in the reading you have to do all this stuff to to get it and it's like it's in just like these like small amounts you know we were saying from the last question it's like microscopic so like it seems like it would be really tricky and and i guess the other thing is that because it's ice like you have to collect that and you have to you know you have to like like i guess melt it you know what i mean like you have to do all that stuff wall like before you can use so i it's not ready to us why don't think it's a very useful "
4634,310.1,Farrah,,"i like your thinking that is awesome you used details from our text to support your thinking so that's awesome ","um so basically i thought that okay so my answer is also know and that i guess i feel a little different from student is like it wouldn't be useful for a long time "
4638,230.1,Farrah,,"okay what do you mean by that ","well okay so you know how they were saying in the reading kind of like what i've said like they need like all this there's all these processes to to break it down and do stuff with it so i do think that it might be useful i bench but like right now like i don't think the evidence is very fancy because it's like saying you know can you use it can you use it now i don't think it's very good until we figure out how to how to make it useful and we haven't done "
4642,310.1,Chris,,"so awesome job using evidence from the text as well ","um yeah so i just basically was just thinking also that that like water can be broken down into arts i virgin and oxygen i agree with with student i think there's lots of reasons why it would be useful "
4645,310.1,Chris,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next box i really wanted to make sure that i was able to share with you hi "
4647,310.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing okay "
4652,120.2,Luis,,"and so we want to answer this question together what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","i do i do "
4655,120.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so okay my name is student and actually so i kind of know what equipment is like it's stuff that you it's like machines and tools and things that you use but my real question is like i don't think i should be in this class like i know already all about space and i know like everything there is to know about space so like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help "
4662,210.4,Farrah,,"So in the third paragraph, it's talking about a microscope. ","yeah ok so a microscope is okay so in the text it said a microscope is a scientific tool and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so it's like something that you look at something that's really small but i have a question like why is my answer wrong like i feel like my answers right because like you have to use like like microscope to see the water "
4669,230.1,Oliver,,"she said a microscope is used to see things that are really small why do you think the scientists would need to use the microscope to see the water yes student ","um okay so basically you need a microscope to see the water because there's not much water on the like moon surface and you you have to look really closely to find it and see it "
4677,210.4,Jazmin,,"it tells you in paragraph three does class see that ","i can see it but here's the thing that i was thinking is the i thought that thesmall machine that nasa sent was the thing that discovered the water is it the microscope but like i think that they discovered it with the machine "
4686,130.3,Chris,,"and the ice deposits that makes sense and then they used the microscope to look more at it to discover ","so i was just kind of wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we like went and looked at places and we looked at like exhibits and stuff so like i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff but they don't i don't know like i already know that so i'm wondering like maybe that's the equipment that they used to discover water yeah "
4689,130.3,Chris,,"so they're not they're not using the mask and things to discover the water they're using it more to survive while they're discovering those things ","okay "
4694,130.3,Luis,,,"um okay so we have to go to lunch unfortunately but i just wanted to take a moment and like i just wanted to thank you for like spending this time with us like you really took the time to listen to all of our ideas and you really like helped us to listen to each other's ideas and like even though i didn't really read the text like you were very patient with me and still brought me into the conversation which was pretty cool so i just wanted to thank you and um yeah i hope that we work with you again "
4697,130.3,Oliver,,,"hello how are you "
4699,130.3,Oliver,,,"i'm good we're working on this question about what scientists what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon "
4702,130.3,Luis,,,"okay so i have a question like i know all the stuff about space like practically all you can possibly know like i don't think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help with this "
4704,110.3,Luis,,"well maybe you can help the others ","okay i can do that "
4706,120.2,Luis,,"why don't you start with what it what why do you think that the scientists used on the moon ","well okay so here's what i know is like probably they had to use like i'm like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and they had to use like stuff like that like gloves and like helmets and things i think that's what they had to use "
4710,210.4,Luis,,"but what special machine did they use it was in our reading ","well "
4714,210.4,Farrah,,,"oh yeah okay so i think it's i think it's the microscope i think it's the microscope Um, okay. So I saw it in paragraph three, you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. So I'm not totally sure like why my answers not right. "
4717,420.3,Jazmin,,"why don't we go ahead and look at paragraph two to see if there was a special machine that they brought to investigate can someone see what they brought ","so what i said what i saw is that nasa send a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
4719,230.1,Chris,,"yes that is what they sent and student what did they investigate when they got there ","oh well so i think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water which was pretty cool "
4721,230.2,Oliver,,"and student what happened how did they study that the small ice deposits ","um so they basically used the microscope that student mentioned and basically they use the microscope to study the the tiny little pieces of water like that you couldn't really see necessarily with with just your eyes "
4723,110.2,Farrah,,"very good so student do you see now why your answer needs to go a little bit further ","um i think i began to see but i'm still kind of confused because so if they use the lunar orbiter to to find it they couldn't see it without the microscope like they had to go out and look at the crystals right "
4725,130.1,Farrah,,"that's true but they couldn't get the crystals to investigate without the small machine right ","oh so okay so they had to use this small machine to like find it in the first place "
4727,130.3,Farrah,,"yeah so first they had to find it and then they could investigate using the microscope ","gotcha okay that that that makes a little more sense i think i think that makes sense um "
4731,510.1,Chris,,"often when we read it will tell us a sequence it will tell us what happened first and then what happens next so it's important when we are answering our questions to look to see if we have gone in the order that is in the story ","yes student yeah okay so i think like for okay i went to nasa with my dad and we looked around at like all the exhibits and all the stuff and i kind of like i know from my own like reading and from my like visit that you have to use all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like what student said so like i don't know like that does that fit into the answer "
4734,110.3,Luis,,"it ties because sometimes our personal experience helps us to understand what we're reading and so student when you are reading if you've seen these things at nasa itt helps you to visualize them and to know more about them and so that's a great thing to share with the class does class else have an experience that similar ","um yeah so i guess like for me it's like um i didn't really read it because i kind of knew all this stuff but i guess there's more in the reading so like the stuff about the orbiter and the microscope like i guess it didn't really think about that "
4740,110.3,Bennett,,"good so sometimes if you if you already know something i think we can always learn more about it or maybe you could see if your classmates maybe they don't know it and they need your help ","um so we have to go to lunch in just a second but i wanted to just thank you for working with us today because i'm sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher because we don't always work together but today you really asked us to think about each other's answers and really kind of listen to each other and and be patient with each other and kind of like even student like didn't do the reading like you were like really nice to him and i just wanted to thank you because it felt really safe to like put out our ideas so i just wanted to thank you for that all right welcome back so how did that feel "
4744,110.1,Luis,,"alright thank you very much for taking the time to work on and give me your answers i really appreciate the work that you've done in the time that you've put into it ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
4746,110.3,Luis,,"well maybe you can be a benefit to others by listening and offering some suggestions ","oh yeah yeah sure i'll tell class what i know "
4755,210.4,Farrah,,"but there's another tool that was used to discover the water and that looked more closely at the water but it wasn't what was discovering the water ","oh i don't remember where it is i mean i guess i could just i could look back at the story again "
4760,110.3,Luis,,"or maybe you could help us out ","well i was thinking that you know how i learned a lot about science is by i'm watching youtube videos and and and watching the show on on on nova show on pbs so i was thinking that maybe student needs to watch more more science videos "
4768,210.4,Farrah,,"We can look at the text and we can look for clues ","okay i'm working i'm looking at the text and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
4770,210.4,Farrah,,,"oh yeah it's me miss bailey i just looked at the text i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
4773,130.2,Farrah,,"and while i talked to some of the others maybe we'll discover it together what do you think ","oh ok ok "
4779,210.2,Oliver,,"In the question. There's a term. And the question that we're looking for. ","equipment "
4781,110.4,Jazmin,,"yes equipment is one of the terms equipment student ","i was thinking discover "
4783,110.4,Chris,,"discover okay good what else ","well for me i was thinking about water seem to be an important word in the question "
4788,210.2,Farrah,,"so what are the keywords we already talked about water discover and equipment right ","i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i got that i'm in the third paragraph "
4790,210.3,Farrah,,"okay you do need it to look closely but that means you already found it right ","oh yeah yeah to look at it yeah "
4794,110.1,Oliver,,"And jab. You said that you circled the same as Farrah. Let's see. ","yeah "
4799,110.1,Oliver,,"it's right on to that hold on just a minute and ","well i just mean like when we were saying our answers out loud like um i had the exact same sentence that i have circled on my my my text to the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
4802,110.1,Oliver,,"um and now that we've talked about it ","um well you did say that um you can't look if you're looking at the water than your you have to first that's the second stop so then um i guess i have to look for the first step i gosh "
4808,130.2,Chris,,"and let's see class raise your hand if you think that's a true statement they found craters full of water on the moon ","Well, your side equipment. okay yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
4813,420.2,Jazmin,,"student you wrote that nasa sent a small machine that's very good so maybe we need to investigate look a little further to see what is that machine called ","okay i should look at it i don't remember "
4818,210.3,Luis,,"Okay, so NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate. So let's look at our question again and see if that answers. What equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon. ","i'm okay so i think it's that i'm at the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
4820,210.3,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry my spelling but i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we have to go "
4822,210.3,All,,,"thank you all bye "
4826,210.3,,,,"it was good we had a chocolate chip cookie and and we also have lasagna so it was delicious "
4828,210.3,Luis,,,"i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm okay "
4830,110.3,Luis,,"well just like last time you had something to contribute to the class so we're going to hang tight and maybe you can contribute some more what do you think ","oh "
4835,120.2,Chris,,"is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable what are the keywords in that question i'll read it again so you can hear them ready is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","i think water again is the keyword and may be valuable "
4840,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay that's two of the keywords student you can maybe you can give us another one ","um i think that um is a keyword and the second one and maybe moon because we're talking about water on the moon "
4842,120.4,Farrah,,"How about Farrah. ","okay i think my answer i chose i'm valuable it's important one "
4847,110.1,Luis,,"mm hmm good job it is important we do agree on that ","i'm gonna say convincing Evidence evidence, our teachers always asked "
4849,210.2,Luis,,"okay so what is evidence ","evidence as one it's like something that you can pro you know it can't be something that like you think but you gotta be able to prove it "
4856,220.1,Jazmin,,"And so in this case. That's what we're going to do. So let's take a look at your answers. ","we can tell you our answers to if that "
4859,220.1,Jazmin,,,"okay well i'll go i'll go first cuz i'm still kind of confused it's me student okay i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
4863,230.3,Jazmin,,"okay just a good piece of evidence that we can use water and specifically that the astronauts could use water ","why is it wrong "
4866,420.2,Jazmin,,"so one strategy we could use let's let's work together with student let's help her her figure out what we could add to this okay so what is a strategy that we can use to look back at the text and to know where to look in the text ","well i know i know that i'm supposed to look for the keywords and the text and i guess that's why i'm confused because i feel like i did that "
4871,120.3,Jazmin,,"okay let's see ","cuz my answer i said astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water okay and then in the paragraph number four it says future astronauts could drink this water i added on another detail because i know that's another strategy we're supposed to do is is because the last question you said that i needed to add more details and so i "
4875,130.2,Chris,,"so let's see who can add to that ","Okay, it's me, Chris, I talked about the water to I said I'm water is heavy. So it's good. They don't have to carry it in the ships anymore. "
4877,130.2,Oliver,,,"i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
4882,410.2,Chris,,"wow that's very possible and student you did find some good information because water can be very heavy that is true but we're looking for convincing evidence that it could be valuable ","okay it takes "
4884,210.3,Chris,,"it says it's good so it's good i don't have to carry on the ships anymore and that's that is some good information but does that convince us that water on the moon can be valuable ","no no i guess not "
4894,120.3,Farrah,,"look at paragraph five ","is me student i see the last sentence kind of after student and chris's it says having water available on the moon would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things so is that the right answer "
4896,230.1,Farrah,,"what would that be valuable ","oh yeah having more room would be valuable "
4898,130.1,Oliver,,"okay so that's that's part of an up the answer is that we could have more space having more room and let's see ","i agree what student "
4901,510.1,Oliver,,"we don't want to just say we agree it's good to agree with people but it's also good to know why we we think something ","okay i agree with some out because i do think that um well the thing that i'm so after student said a thing about drinking the water and then student to think about the water being heavy i'm done it does say more room i mean i have to share a room with my two brothers and so if i had more room in my in my room than i would think that would be valuable "
4907,110.1,Chris,,"um i think that would be valuable to all right let's see ","okay um let's let's really i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go again um but it's me student i did want to say thanks for for for hearing our ideas like i feel like you you listen to everybody's ideas and make us feel like valued oh like the water but also that you had me and student kind of look back at at the story so we could find more evidence and build on each other's ideas and i think that was helpful too yeah "
4909,110.1,All,,,"okay bye "
4911,110.1,Luis,,,"yeah i just wanted to say i just wanted to remind you and class that my dad is actually an astronaut "
4916,120.4,Luis,,"so student can you remind you what was your answer for this question ","um yeah so i said that water can be split into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen "
4919,210.3,Luis,,"um so do you what do you think do you think that that's partially convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","um you know i think it's pretty convincing because those two things are so important in space and like for space travel that i think it's convincing that they have like you know what they talk about with whay you can do yeah i think it's convincing "
4921,430.2,Luis,,"good so with your answer what i want you to do is to describe the reasons why it's valuable when you split oxygen and hydrogen does that make sense student ","oh yeah like using the evidence yeah yeah that makes sense "
4924,150.1,Chris,,"yes good okay so that's what you do to re evaluate your answer ","um yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
4927,120.1,Chris,,"but let's see can you find some other reasons and other evidence that's just one thing can you find some more evidence that supports water being valuable on the moon does that make sense student ","yeah i'll try i'll see what i can find "
4929,120.4,Oliver,,"okay student can you tell me what your answer was ","um yeah so i said that um no like i didn't think the evidence was very convincing because it's not ready yet "
4932,130.3,Oliver,,"okay so it's not written about it not might not be completely ready yet but as they were as time goes on it could be i think that it could be valuable ","um yeah i could try to look for reasons um i just think that like it just seems like it's not you know what i mean cuz it's not ready yet like it would take such a long time to be useful you know what i mean so it didn't seem very convincing because it seems like we'd hav to use but yeah i can look and see "
4938,120.4,Jazmin,,"can you remind me student what was your answer to this question ","i said that it definitely would be useful because the scientists can drink water and and people can't survive without water "
4944,130.1,Farrah,,"student had a good start on his too ","um so my answer was i guess no that it wasn't very convincing because kind of like what student said like we wouldn't be able to use it for space for a long time you know "
4946,210.3,Farrah,,"okay um well just because we can't use it right now at this moment does that mean that in the future it wouldn't be valuable what do you think ","i guess that's a good question i guess it could be valuable in the future "
4948,210.3,Farrah,,,"you certainly have more spaceships "
4952,130.3,Chris,,"yeah so let's think of it as you know maybe it's not great right now but in the future it can be valuable ","um yeah i guess i was thinking like well let's see what was i gonna say i was gonna say that well i guess what i found was that water can be broken down into two parts so hydrogen and oxygen so i guess i was going to say that like yeah that's stuff that also is useful "
4954,420.2,Chris,,"good so you're right it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen now let's go a little bit further with that answer and can you also see if you can find what you can use the broken down oxygen and hydrogen for and that can go along with your evidence ","oh yeah yeah okay "
4958,120.1,Jazmin,,"so student and student you class have been working together and student are you able to re-evaluate your answer and maybe provide some more evidence ","yet so basically so and student was sharing his answer about how water can be split into two parts into oxygen and hydrogen so i guess like that was something that just says like it was even more useful than just using the water like you can use water and then you can use oxygen and then you can also use hydrogen and unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just really wanted to thank for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for like hearing all of our answers and really taking the time to listen to what each of us was saying "
4960,120.4,Luis,,"okay class so let's go ahead and review your answers yes student ","um yeah so um i just wanted to say that like i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space "
4962,120.4,Luis,,"well let's review some answers and then we'll see about that okay so student i noticed that you when you answered can you repeat your answer for me ","um yeah so basically what i said was um let's see what did i say i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
4966,430.3,Luis,,"could you go back and look in your text and see if you can find a different kind of equipment so instead of oxygen tanks let's see if you can find the equipment that helped scientists to discover the water on the moon does that make sense student ","um yeah is there somewhere that because i'm not sure where to look is there somewhere i should be looking "
4968,420.3,Luis,,"so um the sections are labeled 1 2 3 4 5 and six let's take a look at section three and see if you can find an example of the equipment they used to find water on the moon ","okay "
4971,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay i'm gonna while you look i'm going to go to student and look at jazmin's answer so student can you repeat your answer for me please ","yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine "
4974,420.3,Chris,,"so look back through your texts and see if you can look for that keyword equipment and then see if you can find the answer to the question ","um yeah so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
4977,120.4,Farrah,,"yes student ","on i was just wondering because i guess i'm still not sure why my answer's wrong "
4979,120.4,Farrah,,"um can you repeat your answer for me ","yeah so my answer was basically that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
4983,120.4,Farrah,,"so can you read your response one more time student a please ","yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
4985,210.3,Farrah,,"maybe instead of using the word tool we could use a different word what would be another word that you can use ","well i guess like i mean i guess you could say like you know you said equipment like definitely microscopes you know it's in a piece of equipment that they looked at because the water was was microscopic right "
4987,130.3,Farrah,,"so maybe instead of tool you can use the word equipment to answer your question does that make sense ","yeah i think so "
4990,120.4,Luis,,"okay so student did you discover how to did you discover the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon ","um well i just kind of kept looking around and look what i was like i i looked in paragraph three looking but i was like it looks like they use the microscope but like i don't know like did they use it to discover like it seems like there's a lot of equipment that they used "
4992,110.1,Chris,,"okay i'm student ","yeah i i kind of had that like because i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use like a lot of equipment that wasn't in the reading but oxygen tanks and masks and suits and things like that "
4994,410.2,Chris,,"so they do use a lot of things but you didn't look for the specific equipment that the scientists used to discover the water ","yeah i think so i guess i was wondering like did they did they not use suits or like i guess i was just wondering like should we say from what we know or you know what i mean "
4997,410.2,Oliver,,"yeah so i mean you do have a point there that they used other things too but i was just looking for a piece of equipment that they use to discover water on the moon ","we unfortunately have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us hi how are you "
4999,410.2,Oliver,,,"we're doing well we're excited to work with you "
5002,410.2,Luis,,,"oh oh i have a question and can i just kind of see just like one thing real quick "
5004,410.2,Luis,,,"okay so i like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space like i know everything practically there is to know that i don't really need any help "
5007,110.1,Jazmin,,"well i think that you can learn something from any of these four other students that you have in here ","yes i can hear you just fine "
5010,230.2,Jazmin,,"can you figure out what the name of that small machine is ","okay so in paragraph two nasa scientists small machine called lunar orbiter so it says lunar orbiter right "
5012,110.4,Jazmin,,"yes ","great "
5014,110.4,Farrah,,,"um yeah so here's my question so i don't really understand why i'm why my answer is wrong "
5017,230.2,Farrah,,"just um can you go into more detail about what else what other equipment might be used other than just a microscope ","well i mean i i guess yeah but it seems like the microscope is like they can't see the water without the microscope you know like they have to be able to see it in order to study it "
5019,230.2,Farrah,,"right um but what did nasa have to send in order to use a microscope ","oh well they sent up it sounds like student just like the lunar orbiter "
5023,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","so does that mean that they use both of them to discover the water or did the one of them discover it and one of them did something else i'm a little confused "
5026,110.1,Jazmin,,"alright ","does that mean that my answer is wrong like did the microscope do the discovering or was it the lunar orbiter "
5031,110.1,Luis,,,"yeah i already know a lot about space so i should be honest "
5033,120.4,Luis,,"okay well do you know the answer to our question that we are talking about today so how did scientists discover water on the moon ","oh yeah sure um well they need like oxygen tanks and spacesuits in order to roll up to the moon "
5037,120.1,Luis,,"but how did they discover water on the moon what things did they need to find the water ","hmm i'm not sure "
5041,120.1,Luis,,"so what machine did they use to find that water ","um i don't know "
5044,210.4,Luis,,"what is that machine called ","lunar orbitre "
5048,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah so they sent that machine to investigate it will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so those ice deposits are made out of water they had a hard time finding water unless they use that machine to help them search for it ","right yeah yeah ice and water it's the same thing right okay i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5051,420.2,Jazmin,,"but looking more specifically you want to see if you can find the exact name of that machine and kind of be able to explain what that machine does so your answer was right on it you just wanted to add some more detail to it ","okay "
5054,150.1,Oliver,,"great are there any more questions ","well um i mean i think that i had the right answer so um i guess i don't know why my answers wrong too okay um i had the same answer as student "
5060,210.4,Oliver,,"but the microscope was used for something different the small machine the lunar orbiter was used to find the water so there's two different machines and equipment things that they used ","okay one was used for to find the water any other thing was used for something different right which which one is the right one "
5062,130.3,Farrah,,"so the lunar orbiter was the correct one that is the small machine that they use to find the water the microscope was used to look more closer to the water ","oh but i guess so how do you figure that out is it just because you're the teacher you know you know "
5064,150.1,Chris,,"well i look back at the paragraphs that you have to find your answer in the reading that's what the most important thing is so you need to read and be able to find your answers in the text so i looked very closely to find the details that we were looking for ","okay well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5066,110.4,Chris,,"yes you're right ","so i mean that feels like that could be like some tools that they would use to somebody equipment you know "
5069,210.2,Oliver,,"the question was just specifically asking how they discovered water we were looking for the tool for water ","okay okay okay so thanks teacher it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for working with us "
5071,210.2,All,,,"bye "
5077,150.1,Luis,,"what do you class have questions about so ","oh not so much a question i just wanted to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
5080,110.1,Luis,,"oh really that is awesome ","yeah that's why i know so much about space okay "
5085,110.1,Luis,,"well i am glad that you know a lot ","um well for me i dont know convincing evidence "
5091,230.3,Farrah,,"so i see that student and student you class said know that you didn't think that there was any evidence to find water valuable ","i was just kind of thinking you know about the fact that um that it said that they need to come up with a plan for extracting the water so it seemed like and they need to study it so it seems like they got they there it's it's nowhere near ready you know there's got to be a lot of time left since i got to have a plan and a study "
5097,210.4,Jazmin,,"like in paragraph five there are a lot of examples about how the water could be valuable how could it be used ","well i thought that you know that they could like make them own garden you know and so they could grow vegetables and pinks "
5104,110.4,Oliver,,"so it is very valuable and you class are all giving me good answers on that yeah ","i was in paragraph one it says water is heavy and it says that future astronauts could drink this water "
5110,420.2,Jazmin,,"they can use it for rocket fuel it can be split apart ","so my answer is right "
5113,110.2,Chris,,"but you class were right there at it so so ","What I say yes it's valuable cause it's heavy, and they don't have to carry it in ships. "
5115,130.3,Jazmin,,"yes and you can also say how it's important that it will help them be able to survive because they need that water ","so i would say yes it's valuable because you need water to drink "
5117,110.4,Chris,,"yes and you need water to survive yes you're right ","yeah i also know like you said that water splits into oxygen and hydrogen "
5124,210.4,Farrah,,"for other things so they breathe the oxygen and then the hydro jen can actually be used for rocket fuel so they split that up apart so that they can use it for different things ","oh wow okay i guess i hear what you're saying about why student and student are right but i guess i don't know where they found the answer okay how did they do that "
5129,150.1,Farrah,,"So they're using all those background knowledge tips in order to help them find the answer to ","so they're using their background knowledge so me and student get it because we don't know as much about space as then "
5134,150.1,Oliver,,"so if you read and you look for those details and you can also get the answer to ","all oh ok ok i think i think i understand so it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for kind of explaining what me and student need to work on well i guess all of us that we should um keep reading the passage course i'm even though we don't know as much about spaces student and student they weren't right either because they needed to put all their ideas together "
5137,150.1,All,,,"okay expand our answers okay thank you so much teacher okay bye "
5143,150.1,Luis,,"does class see that sentence ","ah yeah i see it i have a quick question though "
5145,150.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's the thing i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like so much about space that i don't really think i need like any help with this i think i already know like a lot about this stuff "
5147,110.2,Luis,,"yeah a lot i did notice that you you pointed out the oxygen tanks that was a really cool answer that you gave but as you see there was more information that we always can learn that we didn't know before did you know the name of this orbiter ","well i guess i didn't really like do the reading exactly i kind of just like had my knowledge but um so i guess no "
5149,220.1,Luis,,"yeah well we always have a good background knowledge of space and that's really cool that you're interested in it but we can always learn new names for machinery and things like that so that's why we read this passage together in hopes that you would learn more ","okay gotcha "
5152,120.4,Jazmin,,"student do you remember the name ","yeah okay i think so when we were rereading i saw that in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
5154,120.4,Jazmin,,,"so um "
5156,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay so here's the thing though um so it i was saying that it was the microscope that discovered the water i'm not sure like what my answer is wrong "
5161,130.3,Farrah,,"so you were almost right but the machine itself that they used was called a lunar orbiter and that's what they used to see the ice deposits ","oh so like they like found it using the lunar orbiter and then they used the microscope like like to see it "
5166,130.1,Chris,,"yeah they looked at it really close with the microscope so you weren't exactly wrong there was just a more specific answer um so yeah good job ","um yeah so like here's my thinking like man like so my dad like took me to nasa and we checked out like all these different exhibits and stuff like that which was awesome but like here's the thing like um like like what student was saying like so i know that they have to use like the astronauts when they go out on the moon they have to use like oxygen tanks and um like you know like spacesuits and fuel so like i guess i'm wondering like isn't that what they used to discover the to discover the the the water "
5170,110.2,Jazmin,,"well it definitely helped them because you know in space there's not a lot of oxygen so you have to have those tanks to help you breathe so that was one equipment that they did use ","yeah so i was wondering with my very first answer when i said it was the small machine why was that not right "
5177,510.1,Oliver,,"when we're given questions we'd like to find answers that are very specific because the more specific they are the more sense that they make later on ","um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us like sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher he says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful in the way that you like um like student i'm not sure he did the reading and i feel like i'm you really were were kind with his answer and really helped like all of our answers like worked on one another tp kind of get a class answer together which was pretty cool because like sometimes we don't always listen to each other so it was really neat to like listen to each other's answers thanks to the way you were teaching us so just wanted to thank you "
5179,510.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
5181,510.1,Oliver,,,"how are you "
5183,510.1,Oliver,,,"we're good we're discussing um what equipment id scientists use to discover water on the moon "
5187,120.2,Luis,,"perfect and what equipment did they use ","um okay so here's the thing um i think that um i should really be in this class because i don't really need any help like i basically know like all about space and so like i kind of like have all this knowledge so i don't think i really need the help okay "
5190,110.3,Luis,,"and you'll be able to share all your knowledge ","that sounds good "
5194,230.1,Jazmin,,"student could you explain your answer to the rest of the class like how did you come up with your answer ","okay so my answer was the nasa scientists small machine and i noticed that in the reading that they they had that that was a piece of equipment that was used to discover water like they uses the the machine to go in like to find the water "
5197,230.1,Farrah,,"all right student i noticed you said that the scientists were using a microscope um could you and student try and explain why you picked microscope ","um yeah okay so basically the microscope so i was looking at paragraph three and they said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i i thought you have to be able to see the water in order to discover it so i said the microscope "
5200,210.4,Farrah,,"but i kind of agree with student and saying that they just they brought the machine from the second paragraph to the moon and that machine helped them look into those craters but then the microscope helps you analyze the water that they already found ","so um yeah it's it's speaking to me since i think but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong because didn't they have to use the microscope to discover it "
5203,210.4,Farrah,,"but the small machine did it without having to send people out there because one we have a lot of water here on earth so why do we want water from the moon and two that's a lot of time time and money and as a as a teacher and we know we don't have a lot of money why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have ","oh gotcha okay "
5205,210.4,Chris,,,"yeah okay so like here's the thing like i'm kind of thinking like um so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at all the equipment and stuff so i know that there's a lot of there's like a lot of equipment that they use like spacesuits and oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i guess like did they not use those things "
5214,140.1,Chris,,"if somebody asked you what keeps your food cold use that you would say like the refrigerator you wouldn't say the plug that plugs into the outlet that supplies the power ","okay okay i think oh i should probably read the the reading like a little closer maybe "
5216,210.2,Chris,,"Because the question. I feel like is a little bit more specific on what discovered the water because you could also argue that the astronaut discovered the water ","yeah yeah i guess you could like and i guess it's like um i guess just wondering like did the astronaut go or was it like an unmanned probe you know what i mean "
5223,120.4,Oliver,,"all right before our little time is up and we need a good clear concise answer class have one that they would like to share ","yes okay so the question was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon and the scientists used a small machine to discover the water on the moon and they use the microscope um wait student can you help yeah so um yeah so basically they they use the small machine to discover the water and they use the microscope to like study it "
5228,120.4,Jazmin,,,"yes student basically we have to go to lunch but i just i just wanted to thank you really quickly for working with us today and specifically like you really were patient with class like sometimes we give like our science teacher like he says they're stress hives and i feel like you were really patient with us and you also they were really interested in our answers like even when we weren't like totally correct or like we were sort of figuring it out like you really listen to all of us which is kind of cool so do you think thank you so much "
5230,120.4,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5232,120.4,Luis,,,"that was me student "
5237,230.1,Luis,,"well student if you already know a lot about space can you go ahead and explain why you pick the answer that you did ","yeah sure okay so i was talking about how scientists need a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know cuz they can't breathe on the moon and so they're gonna need oxygen tanks to go on the moon to do any type of exploration you know um did you hear my answer teacher or do you want me to say it again "
5239,230.3,Luis,,"i heard up until where you said the you know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks because they can't breathe in space so we need oxygen ","yeah exactly you can't go to the mon without an oxygen tank "
5241,410.2,Luis,,"but i'm a little confused on how the oxygen tank helped them discover the water on the moon because to me they needed the oxygen tanks to get to space and to be able to survive in space i don't see how oxygen tanks discovered the water ","well i mean they can't walk around on the moon without oxygen tanks to breathe "
5245,410.2,Jazmin,,"the point of the oxygen tank is to supply oxygen to the astronauts i don't think the intention is for it to discover water ","yeah yeah now okay teacher "
5247,410.2,Jazmin,,,"i don't know why my answer is wrong "
5252,410.2,Jazmin,,"so i would say that your answer was just a little bit incomplete it was lacking just a small detail on what specific machine they sent ","okay i guess i thought we were all here cuz our answers were wrong i thought that's why the teacher told us to come to this small class "
5260,230.3,Chris,,"they said that they wanted a microscope ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5267,410.2,Oliver,,"so back to you savannah and student the microscope helps them look closer at the water but the microscope itself didn't actually discover the water ","you were about to tell us your suggestion to all of us "
5272,410.2,Oliver,,"I think. I think everybody had you know, good effort on answering the question, but I think we all could have answered the question better and more specific. ","okay oh i just looked at the time and it's time for us to go to lunch um but thank you for taking the time to work with us "
5274,410.2,Luis,,,"hi i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut "
5277,110.1,Luis,,"yeah student ","i know a lot about space "
5280,140.1,Chris,,"well fun fact when i was in first grade i wanted to be an astronaut so obviously i didn't live up to that but you know that was my goal ","you're a really good teacher "
5288,230.1,Oliver,,"but i'm a little concerned with student and student on your responses because you both said no there was not convincing evidence so i want to know from either of you why you say there was not enough to convince you that the water is valuable ","okay but it's not it's not ready yet because i'm one you look in paragraph paragraph six it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money um they need to study the moon surface and built new equipment do you think it would be a good investment you'll decide well no it's not ready cause it'll take a lot of time and money so so no it's my answer "
5295,210.4,Jazmin,,"and two that's a lot of time time and money and as a as a teacher and we know we don't have a lot of money why would we want to spend extra money on something we already have ","Well, I also think that he could use water to grow things so we can have a moon garden on the moon. "
5298,130.3,Jazmin,,"would it be on me i guess what kind of space plant would it be because earth plants need oxygen to or i guess carbon dioxide that we give off so i'm not sure if that's a space for them to grow ","yeah that's a good point i didn't think of how the heck "
5300,130.3,Jazmin,,,"i don't know if you still wanted to talk to student and student but well i think that my answer was a good answer "
5302,120.4,Jazmin,,"your answer was what ","good i think i had the right answer i said yes astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water and and that's true and they talk about in the first paragraph that astronauts could drink the water so why am i in this class "
5313,310.1,Chris,,"um i like that we all had our reasons and justified our reasons you said yeah and then you pulled your evidence from the text ","great great i just thought of something else okay from the story water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
5326,210.4,Oliver,,"and the text says that it can be used as rocket fuel ","i don't think i saw that part i don't remember that part either honestly rocket fuel oh yeah it does it says it right here you're right where do you see that student middle of the paragraph it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel oh ok ok so i just have to add that sentence to my answer and then my answer is ok all i have to do is add the thing about rocket fuel to my answer water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they make rocket fuel that's it "
5332,310.1,Oliver,,"of the water and how the water could be used ","okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch um i did want to say all thank you for explaining what all of us need it to work on i'm like i know that i didn't answer the right question um but even didn't answer the question but he needed more details and his answer "
5334,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay well we'll see you next time bye "
5337,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
5341,150.1,Jazmin,,"so we are going to think a little bit yes ","can you say it again "
5346,220.1,Luis,,"we are have been talking about that the moon is a desert right and you answered your questions and we are going to discuss and see how did we understand this questions so we're going to discuss and listen to our friends responses ","oh can i ask a question real quick "
5348,220.1,Luis,,,"okay so here's the here's the thing like i know a lot about space already like i know all this stuff and so i don't really think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
5351,110.3,Farrah,,"good but every time we learn something we continue growing and learning so we are going to listen to our friends okay thank you for your input and i'm glad that you know a lot about space and we can learn from you right ","yeah we can do that "
5354,230.1,Farrah,,"need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely did you understand you answer ","yeah so i my answer was in paragraph three and i said on that said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you need the the microscope to see the water "
5359,230.1,Oliver,,"you said that you circled the same as student what did you understand ","um so yeah i basically did the same thing as student i looked at the same paragraph and it said that um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i figured that the equipment that they studied the um the water with was a microscope "
5363,230.1,Chris,,"you understand that answer ","yeah so like i guess there's like all these craters they got all this kind of water and all this stuff like um so they got like lots of water on the moon "
5365,230.2,Chris,,"okay and you understand what equipment they used ","um yeah like i think they just use basically like um like spacesuits and like i know cuz i went to nasa so like they use like oxygen tanks and and masks and suits like to go flying around in space "
5370,110.1,Chris,,"okay thank you for that input okay ","um well i kind of know about space um i didn't really read that Yeah, I can. I can do that. "
5373,110.1,Jazmin,,,"i was just wondering like why my answer might be wrong because it sounds like like farrah's answer and oliver's answer might be right with a microscope but i thought it was the small machine that did the discovery "
5376,230.2,Jazmin,,"and what else did you did you read ","well i read it in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
5379,210.4,Jazmin,,"what was the name of the small machine ","okay so it was the lunar orbiter so is that what i got wrong is that didn't say the lunar orbiter "
5381,130.1,Jazmin,,"no it's not wrong okay you just need to elaborate a little bit more okay ","okay gotcha "
5383,130.1,Jazmin,,,"so "
5386,130.1,Jazmin,,,"so i'm just wondering like which one is like so am i right about the lunar orbiter is the how they discovered the water "
5388,110.4,Jazmin,,"those are the tools that they are using to discover water on the moon ","okay "
5390,110.4,Jazmin,,"okay nasa sent a small machine ","did they use the microscope to discover it "
5394,130.2,Oliver,,"did we read about that student ","yeah so basically um i think that well it sounds like the microscope like yeah i think the microscope is how they found it like i think they use both of them to find it they use the orbiter and the microscope to discover the water "
5398,210.4,Luis,,"and can you remember what other equipment they use or other tools that we read about ","well yeah like i think that the thing that they did was they had to use like spacesuits and stuff like so i didn't really even read it i just kind of knew that like they had to use that stuff you know they had to use like space suits and stuff "
5404,110.2,Jazmin,,"exactly ","um we can unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we left i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us sometimes like our teachers are always so patient with us but you were really patient and you also made us all i think feel like our answers were really worthwhile even if we weren't totally accurate so i just wanted to thank you because that feels really good when we're trying to learn something so thank you so much "
5408,110.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i basically like i already know like all sorts of stuff about space and i don't really feel like i need to be in this class because i know all kinds of stuff "
5412,110.3,Luis,,"with more information about what we're learning okay ","yeah i can do that "
5426,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah how did you come up with that answer can you share with your your students student ","yeah yeah so i came up with the answer because okay so i was looking in paragraph he and i saw that basically by they said that the water that they found on the moon is microscopic and you couldn't see it unless you keep your microphone so i thought that's how they that's how they found the water "
5430,110.1,Chris,,"okay thank you ","oh um well actually i think student was pinnacle "
5434,110.1,Jazmin,,,"just said that i think he raised his hand by accident so what i was gonna say was i was just gonna say that like i don't really understand like why my answers wrong "
5441,220.1,Jazmin,,"reflect on our answer in think to improve our response can we do that ","yeah "
5444,120.4,Oliver,,"can you share with your friends what was your response ","yeah so basically my response was i circled the same thing as survey "
5450,130.2,Oliver,,"and if you have any questions we can help somebody else can help out ","so yeah i wasn't sure how to make my answer better "
5454,130.2,Farrah,,"can somebody help ","i think that you were saying right well you should use evidence and say like where we we found her answer is that right "
5459,110.4,Oliver,,"mm hmm ","um well yeah i could do that because i actually saw a lot of the same stuff as student so basically what i saw was in the same thing that third paragraph where they were saying that you wouldn't even be able to see the water if you were looking like right at it so that made me think that you had to use a microscope to find the water that to discover the water okay "
5462,420.2,Oliver,,"So I suggest that you write, even though it's this almost the same as your ","Okay. "
5465,420.2,Chris,,,"yes so i was just gonna say that i went with my dad and so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like you know like masks such said oxygen tanks and i don't know where that goes in my answer "
5468,150.1,Oliver,,"okay but there is an experience that you you had when you went to nasa and you can connect that with what you are learning thank you for sharing that okay ","um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we just really wanted to thank you for working with us thank you so much bye bye thank "
5471,150.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing well how are you "
5474,220.1,Luis,,"good thing so we're here to talk about this information that we've just read and are learning about ","um yeah so here's the thing like um i know all about space like a lot about space so like i don't think i really need to be here i don't need any help with anything "
5476,110.1,Luis,,"okay well i would love to hear that information that you can give us from this question that we've kind of want to talk about now okay ","um so yeah okay so what i know from my like understanding and like my reading and everything i know about space is that you have to have like an oxygen tank and you have to have a space suits and like all that stuff if you're going to go up into space and like you're out "
5479,230.1,Luis,,"can you tell me a little bit more about that ","maybe i didn't maybe i didn't really read the text very much because i kind of knew about space "
5482,420.2,Luis,,"why is it important to make sure to read all of the information before we try to answer the question ","yeah yeah i think so "
5487,130.2,Farrah,,"student can you help him out there ","so i think that they they use the microscope to discover the water like that's how they they found it so i'm not really sure like why is my answer like um not right "
5490,110.2,Farrah,,"your answer is very right they did use a microscope ","oh yeah okay so in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so you have to see it you can't see it without microscope "
5495,210.3,Chris,,"can class else answer that question though why did they need a microscope to see the water was there a lot of water in the craters or was there just a little bit of water in the craters ","yeah so i thought i think there's a lot of water in the craters so i think they um they just wanted to study more closely because there's a bunch of water "
5498,230.2,Chris,,"so i see deposits are very small does it seem like we have a lot of water or a little bit of water ","i guess maybe not very much water so maybe it's not like full of water "
5501,150.1,Oliver,,"make sense ","yeah "
5505,230.1,Jazmin,,"can you tell me why you thought it was a small machine ","yeah okay so in paragraph two in the first sentence it says a nasa sent a small machine called a lunar oribtor to investigate "
5507,110.4,Jazmin,,"good job ","that's what that's what i think cuz is like investigate's like discover so i think that's what they said discovered the water "
5509,230.1,Jazmin,,"so that's one thing that they used and so we can also collaborate and talk about what that small machine did right ","yeah yeah "
5513,110.1,Chris,,"that's very good good job ","oh i guess it's not really a question um i mean i guess what we kind of talked about this but like well like i guess like i'm like i went to nasa and when i went to nasa with my dad like i saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so um did they not use those things "
5517,210.4,Chris,,"if an astronaut were in space then they would use those things because we can't breathe up there and we need those to help us but they didn't send the astronauts they sent a machine ","i guess i didn't really that makes sense i didn't really read it closely enough because i think i hear what you're saying "
5523,510.1,Luis,,"does that make sense we know we all know different things about space but we also need to make sure that we're really reading the information that we're being given ","um yeah so like here's the thing um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go to lunch i just wanted to like thank you because when um sometimes um our science teacher gets really frustrated with us and says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us even though we kind of were trying to like figure out all these different answers and stuff and like um you you were very like patient with me because like i didn't i didn't read the text but i like i had ideas so i just really appreciate like that you were just like really patient with us and really we're spending time to help us so thank you so much "
5528,130.1,Luis,,"so student i really like what you said with nasa send a small machine you are on the right direction so i want class to look at the text ","um excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know about space "
5531,110.3,Luis,,"well i think that we don't know exactly everything quite yet we can always learn more but you can use some of your knowledge from what you know about space to help us ","okay "
5534,120.1,Jazmin,,"I want us to take a second and reread that paragraph, give me a thumbs up after you've read it. ","the principal doesn't like us to do thumbs up but he said that we can just look at the teacher when we're finished "
5537,120.1,Chris,,,"Okay, we talked. I said-- "
5541,120.1,Chris,,,"we just talked about it and i said that it was the craters the craters of was what they used and and student was talking about how astronauts have a lot of different machines that they use and then and then we were done "
5543,230.1,Luis,,"what kind of machines do they use can you go a little further with that student ","yeah sure um they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more because i know like a lot more machines too "
5546,210.4,Luis,,"let's look at that paragraph number two what machine did they use in that paragraph ","um let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh so it's a lunar orbiter "
5550,120.2,Farrah,,"lunar orbiter that's right so what equipment did the scientists to use to discover water on the moon ","a lunar orbiter Excuse me "
5553,210.4,Farrah,,"let's look at number two this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small ","i'm sorry to interrupt but i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
5556,210.3,Farrah,,"but what did they use to discover it with before they saw the microscope ","before they saw the microscope "
5558,210.3,Farrah,,"yeah before they had the microscope they have to use what to discover it ","well normally use the microscope to see the things um "
5561,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah let's look at number two that paragraph number two again read that first sentence for me ","um nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate keep reading or stop there "
5565,410.1,Chris,,"you are correct with you need a microscope to look at it really closely but they're asking what equipment do the scientists use to discover it the microscope is equipment that they looked really closely at the water with but did they discover the water with the microscope ","um i went to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks well ehtan said that one and like masks they have to wear a mask because they can't breathe in space and um they have to they have to wear these certain types of shoes because there isn't any gravity either so that's all like the stuff that they wear is equipment too "
5567,110.2,Chris,,"that is equipment you're correct they have to use all those things before they can start their explorations that is right student ","yeah "
5575,150.1,Oliver,,"does class else have any questions about their answer ","um i'm not i think i'm still not sure about because i have the same answer as student so how did we get the answer i'm not sure i'm sorry It said, what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? For the kind of equipment that the scientists used "
5577,210.1,Oliver,,"yes it's asking for this equipment the scientist use but not just the equipment the scientists use but the equipment the scientists used for what ","um equipment scientistis used to discover water on the moon "
5579,230.2,Oliver,,"so it's using the equipment to do what ","to discover the water "
5582,230.2,Oliver,,"all right so did they use the microscope to discover the water ","um oh okay oh yeah i guess it says that you use a microscope to look at the water all right "
5585,230.2,All,,,"well i i was looking at the clock just now and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping me to look really closely at the question cuz i didn't i didn't realize i missed part of a question so um thank you bye "
5589,120.3,Luis,,"student are we rereading make sure you're reading our passage ","wow i was just thinking like my dad is an astronaut so i know all this stuff you know "
5591,150.1,Luis,,"so maybe we can read to help us understand a little bit more about what your dad does ","yeah okay yeah that sounds cool "
5598,120.4,Jazmin,,"student why don't you share with us ","well i was thinking that you could use water to grow things so that we could have like a garden can you imagine how beautiful it woud be Um lets see. I was looking at...Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing. "
5606,120.4,Chris,,"student what did you underline ","so i said that you could wait okay um water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen which is a big deal "
5608,230.1,Chris,,"and why is that a big deal how what can i use the hydrogen and oxygen for ","well you could show you can breathe oxygen and you can drink the water that's a big deal "
5611,230.2,Chris,,"that's right where did you find that in the passage show us where you found that ","it's this paragraph five but i guess it's the second paragraph this next one it says water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen astronauts could breathe the oxygen oh and you could use it as rocket fuel "
5615,230.3,Oliver,,"right so they can use the oxygen to breathe and then they can use the hydrogen as or do you want to add to that student ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really just wanted to thank you and i wanted to thank you particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking and really helping us like i think that all of us felt like our ideas were really valued today and it really felt like we had time to explain like what we were thinking about in our different ideas like just wanted to thank you for doing that it was really cool and it was really nice to meet you "
5619,120.2,Luis,,"alright so we just talked read the article water on the moon and the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","hi yeah shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
5625,230.1,Jazmin,,"like what ","like lots of things um okay okay well i know that in order for the astronauts to go up into space they have to be on a space shuttle but then the space shuttle also has this other part to it that like has to fall off you know when it's um in order to in order for it to like to go up into space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space and then i also know that there isn't any oxygen in space so will the the astronauts have to work spacesuits until that some of the kind of equipment that they have to wear a spacesuit so that they can breathe and then we're trying to figure out if we can like do a mission to mars and if there's life on mars where we can read them live um because if we destroy this planet then we might have to move to mars "
5634,210.4,Farrah,,"alright so they use oxygen tanks but what other things do they use in the article ","um they use microscopes because that was that was in my answer and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
5638,210.3,Farrah,,"but do they use the microscopes on the moon or would they have to maybe collect the samples and then we'll get back to earth ","um well in the story it says that well it's talking about the moon and then it says the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so there they are talking about the water on the moon "
5643,210.3,Farrah,,"or is there a better answer ","reads to herself the moon is still the driest desert on earth the water that is found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i'm not sure "
5646,210.4,Farrah,,"not sure okay well you just read paragraph three again maybe let's backtrack a little bit before number three what about number two ","okay reads to herself nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater the ice deposits are very small okay i mean it talks about a machine and this one it talks about a machine and equipment is machine but it doesn't talk about the water "
5650,210.4,Farrah,,"it doesn't talk about the water in paragraph three but before that it talks about how they find evidence of the water right ","Okay. oh yeah it says investigate "
5652,230.2,Farrah,,"investigate right so we have to investigate our evidence and what are we using to investigate our evidence ","oh i'm not sure "
5656,210.3,Chris,,"does class know ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and masks "
5659,120.2,Chris,,"right but can you find what the what nasa used to investigate the water on the moon ","yeah yeah i thought student said they use like a small machine called a lunar lunar orbiter to investigate "
5661,230.1,Chris,,"right and is that lunar orbiter on the moon ","ah well it's a story and i mean the stories about water on the moon so um oh yeah yeah it says it in the second sentence but it will land at the moon yeah "
5668,130.3,Oliver,,"and they use the microscope to look at the small teeny tiny deposit of water that they had but to find this equipment on the moon or to find the water on the moon ","they use the equipment which is the lunar orbiter student what's up i'm sorry i just heard the timer and i was looking over at the clock and that's our bell at told us on it's it's time to go to lunch but i do want to say thank you for helping us to keep looking back i thought story cuz i thought that i had a good answer but then i listened to you kept telling student and student to look back and look and read it again and read it again so thank you for that "
5671,130.3,Luis,,,"bye oh you're welcome bye um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i need to do this "
5675,150.1,Oliver,,"and that's kind of what we're going to be talking about here today so i really liked reading all of your answers um and before we begin what was the most interesting thing you class found in the article ","um i thought the most interesting thing that i saw was the idea that like there was like water up there that like even though it's like very like microscopic that that may be um it could still be used or it could still be something that like is enough that we could do something with it "
5677,310.1,Chris,,"awesome and i love your use of the vocabulary term microscopic that's really good ","um yeah i was really interested in seeing like how they found the water they were trying to like you know what i mean like how they manage to look for it "
5679,110.1,Jazmin,,"yeah that's really cool to student what about you ","um so i was really interested in like i got like really about how be thinking how cool it would be if you could grow this garden that would be so pretty "
5681,110.2,Luis,,"it would and it would be really useful too student what about you ","um yeah so i think for me like i was really interested in seeing like what kind of equipment they could use and i was thinking about like you know that they have other equipment that they use that's not necessarily in the reading but but i know we're supposed to focus on the so yeah "
5684,310.1,Farrah,,"that's exactly right and i love that you're using that prior knowledge that's really good ","um so me well i actually have a question i was not sure like i was thinking a lot about it and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5686,230.3,Farrah,,"Okay, well that's perfect Farrah. So let's go ahead and get into those answers. So you put you need a scientific tool called a microscope to close to look really closely. ","i'm really closely at the water "
5689,210.4,Farrah,,"water right but the question is how do we find the water so what was used what are the scientists using to find the water ","oh that's interesting so okay so the way i was thinking was like that if you i guess okay so if you had to find the water did you have to see it or was there another way maybe to detect "
5696,120.3,Farrah,,"that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day ","okay so to investigate that was the lunar orbiter right "
5699,420.2,Chris,,"so it's really important when we are answering questions even though you found part of the question stem and your answer you've got to look around it to make sure that's the total ","so i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess i was wondering like did they use that to discover the water as well "
5701,410.3,Chris,,"they would have to use a combination of all those things but this article is mainly about the lunar orbiter that they use and what we can do with the water once they found it ","oh "
5704,150.1,Jazmin,,"yeah you got it ","That's it. So I just have to say like the full sentence. "
5706,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah sometimes that works but sometimes we have to look around too so yes it is a small machine and the small machine may answer a question because we have to also ask a small machine that did what ","um it discovered the water "
5708,210.4,Jazmin,,"right and what was that machine called ","it was it was called the lunar orbiter "
5711,110.4,Luis,,"the lunar orbiter that's right ","which unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us a lot of fun thank you so much um yeah so i think i got all this stuff figured out pretty good so i think i'm good "
5714,210.4,Luis,,"and the article talks about how the hydrogen might be able to be used for a rocket fuel which is awesome i think that's really interesting don't you class think so too ","oh yeah it's awesome yeah it's really cool that that's a possibility "
5721,210.2,Oliver,,"so what is the meaning of valuable there ","important like something that's useful or important yeah "
5729,230.2,Chris,,"can we look back for some details student ","some details well okay so we know that like there's a few things that you could do because you could like you could use it to make like rocket fuel you could drink the water there's a lot of stuff you could you could do with it "
5731,230.3,Jazmin,,"yeah you can drink it can make rocket fuel everything else student ","reach every reader you can drink it you can make rocket fuel oh you can breathe it they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen "
5733,310.1,Farrah,,"that's exactly right so like you said your answer student the water is valuable and we really need to discuss why it looks like you've done that in your answer so great job ","i think i just i'm still a little confused "
5739,410.2,Farrah,,"my concern is that you want it to be right now and you're not thinking about the future ","it seems like it would take a lot of money and time it seems like it would be really hard to get class to work together and make it happen but i do think i see what you mean that it is like valuable in theory like no matter when it is "
5742,110.2,Oliver,,"but you're right it will take a lot of time and a lot of money so it might not be worked at student ","um well i actually read somewhere that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so maybe it would be useful faster than student and i thought "
5746,210.3,Luis,,"however is that the best piece of evidence that we can grab from the article to use ","well i guess i'm not sure like when you say the best the best evidence like what do you mean exactly "
5754,210.3,Oliver,,"okay so if i just told you water was split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen did that tell you any information about it on the moon or about astronauts ","i see like i gotta say like i gotta say the whole sentence like you like work with student when she needed to say like the whole thing about the lunar orbiter and the small machine like i need to say like what my opinion is and then i need to say like what it could be used is that right Um, well, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. Before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us to create much more complete answers and like in particular you really asked us to like use evidence from the text and to make sure that we work on yeah backing up our statements with with like actual evidence and things and i think that like everybody's answers got a lot better because of the way that you lead us through that that's the discussion and you also really made us feel valued by making sure that we all like felt like you know like what we were sharing was worthwhile and that was really cool and it was really interesting like to learn new stuff and and to talk about it as a class so thank you so much "
5757,120.1,Luis,,"ok so student you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so look back in paragraph 3 ","excuse me "
5759,120.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5762,120.3,Chris,,"student look back into paragraph 3 and can you read that aloud for me about what they use to find the water in space on the moon ","yeah sure ok paragraph 3 that means the moon is still drier than the rest of oh sorry ok that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
5764,210.4,Chris,,"right so would you be able to see it with your regular eye would you be able to look down at it ","no no you need a microscope to look at it "
5766,120.2,Chris,,"exactly so can you now answer what type of equipment they needed to discover water on the moon ","well i had said that they could do it with the craters i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
5768,210.3,Chris,,"right but did they after reading that last paragraph we just read ","well in that one it was talking about a microscope and how it said the water is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it you need a microscope to look really closely at it "
5770,210.2,Farrah,,"right so the question is asking us what type of equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon so what type of equipment did they have to have in order if it was there to see it ","oh excuse me "
5772,210.2,Farrah,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5774,120.4,Farrah,,"you're right student so what did you say for your answer ","i'd say i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but the teacher said that we were all over here because we had partial responses to the question but i don't understand why mine has a partial response "
5776,120.4,Oliver,,,"yeah and i had the same answer as student i mean not on purpose but i did "
5778,120.3,Farrah,,"right so if you look back at that third paragraph can you read that first sentence for me student ","yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
5780,210.4,Farrah,,"right so is there any water on the moon ","oh no no it's dry it says dry "
5782,230.2,Farrah,,"right so did they actually discover that water was on the moon ","the water they found yeah yeah because in the next sentence it says the water they found is microscopic so they did find some water "
5784,120.3,Farrah,,"but what does the first sentence say ","it says that it's really dry "
5786,120.2,Farrah,,"right but when they were able to discover some how did they discover it ","they said that you need a tool well this was my answer "
5788,120.1,Farrah,,"right but what else did you need to know ","where the water is "
5790,110.4,Chris,,"yes ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
5792,230.2,Chris,,"right but does it mention that in the paragraphs ","oh no "
5794,210.4,Chris,,"ok so let's look back in the text it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found within the moon's polar craters so where can we find water on the moon or where can water be found ","in the polar craters that was my answer yeah "
5797,130.1,Chris,,"in the polar craters so you've got part of the answer right ","ok "
5801,210.4,Chris,,"paragraph 2 says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","the lunar orbiter "
5808,210.4,Jazmin,,"the lunar orbiter so what equipment did they use ","oh ok i got it oh yeah ok so they used the lunar orbiter but then i mean i kind of said that in my answer i said that they sent a small machine No. Oh, OK. "
5810,210.3,Luis,,"and just like student he had mentioned some as well they use a lot of equipment while that's true is that what they used ","well no i guess it's not in the text that they used it "
5812,420.2,Luis,,"so we always have to look back to our text and refer to that when we're trying to find our answers ","miss teacher i just heard the bell so it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate how you kept asking us to go look back at the text over and over again "
5814,420.2,Luis,,,"yeah well ok thank you bye "
5818,420.2,Luis,,,"morning um yeah so i have a question because like i know all about space already so i don't think i should really be in this class "
5820,150.1,Luis,,"think we all should be here i'm so glad that each of you and take your time and completing your task and you know we each of you have varying levels of understanding of the question so each of you are going to have a part where you understood it better than one another and we're going to discuss what we understood does that make sense ","yeah yeah okay i can stick around for that "
5823,220.1,Chris,,"okay all right great so here's what we're gonna do class so we're going to talk about a new skill a new skill of circling or underlining keywords from the question that are in the text okay so what was our question can someone read that for me ","okay so yeah let's see the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
5827,420.1,Farrah,,"let's think about keywords in the question think about that on your own and then we will discuss what keywords we see ","um yeah okay so basically when i was looking at the question some keywords that i was seeing was like equipment that's what i saw that i thought was most important "
5829,110.1,Oliver,,"equipment yes that's great and student ","um yeah i agree with student i also saw equipment and i thought like water too was maybe an important word "
5832,130.2,Farrah,,"student ","i actually have a question i still don't quite understand why my answer was wrong "
5835,150.1,Luis,,"so we're going to discuss that here in just a few moments okay student we're going to discuss why each of your answers for wrong and how we can do better to find the answer ","Um, yeah. So what I saw was, I was looking at what look like they said like scientific tool. hey said, small machine. And I said those were equipment words. "
5837,120.3,Jazmin,,"yes those are great equipment words ok can someone else read me the sentence for those for one of those student can you read me the sentence where it talks about the small machine ","let's see nasa sent a small machine called the lunar obriter to investigate "
5841,120.2,Chris,,"right okay so and our question said that nasa they sent something to an equipment to investigate right so what actual equipment did they sebd to investigate water ","well i was thinking like about you know like the experience that i've had at nasa and stuff and i was thinking that like they must have sent like oxygen tanks and masks and suits with them "
5844,120.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, so now what does it say that they sent. What did they send to investigate. ","he sent the small machine the lunar orbiter "
5847,220.1,Farrah,,"okay so let's look back at student answer real quick we're going to go through each of your responses okay so let's look at your response first what did you say ","i said that basically as i said that you need a small a tool called a microscope "
5850,210.3,Farrah,,"sorry class it says you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay so does that say that that's what nasa sent though student ","oh um i guess not "
5852,210.4,Farrah,,"i know so now let's look back in paragraph two what does it say that they sent to investigate the water ","on they sent the small machine the lunar orbiter "
5855,210.3,Farrah,,"but does that say that's what they sent ","yeah i can see that "
5857,210.3,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we just wanted to thank you so much for working with us "
5863,210.3,All,,,"yeah i'm good good awesome i'm good too "
5865,210.3,Jazmin,,,"i'm good too "
5868,210.3,Jazmin,,,"my name is student "
5870,210.3,Chris,,,"i'm student "
5872,210.3,Farrah,,,"i'm student "
5874,210.3,Oliver,,,"i'm student "
5876,210.3,Luis,,,"yeah and i'm student i don't think i'm supposed to be in this class i already know everything about science "
5878,110.3,Luis,,"ok well you can help me teach the others i really need you to still be in this class so that you can help me help us understand a little bit better ","ok "
5880,110.3,Luis,,,"yeah ok i'll do that "
5882,120.4,Farrah,,"ok good good sounds good so let's see let me see i know you class had already submitted me some questions student can you talk about your question a little bit your answer that you gave me ","yeah sure i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
5884,120.4,Farrah,,,"yeah it's on our tablet on our desks "
5886,120.3,Farrah,,"good awesome so can some student or one of you which would somebody like to volunteer to read paragraph 1 ","oh i'll read can i read "
5888,120.3,Farrah,,"yes absolutely go ahead student paragraph 1 ","ok scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth "
5891,120.3,Farrah,,"good let see are you reading paragraph 1 right under the moon is a desert ","let me see ok i see mine says that scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere oh i see i see ok that's like the fourth sentence in here scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
5895,210.4,Farrah,,"so in our first paragraph that you just read it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters or dark places where the sun never shine ","no no it was in paragraph 3 paragraph 3 "
5898,120.3,Jazmin,,"ok let's go ahead and read paragraph 2 and 3 did somebody want to read two and somebody else want to read three and then we'll talk about those four answers ","yeah i can read paragraph 2 ok yeah this is where my answer is from ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one top of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
5900,120.3,Jazmin,,,"you want me to stop reading or keep reading "
5902,210.4,Luis,,"so paragraph 2 says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in large polar crater i'm sorry in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small so we know that the ice deposits are very small so you're going to need something that can look at small things correct ","yes "
5904,210.4,Luis,,,"i was just going to say that i know all about the ice deposits because that's like because it's really cold there "
5907,110.1,Jazmin,,"oh good that's really good thank you for contributing that ","yeah i was going to say that i don't know why my answer is wrong "
5910,120.3,Chris,,"yes good so let's keep reading paragraph 3 and then we're going to go back and we're going it's kind of getting more information ok but that's a very good start very good so paragraph 3 who would like to read 3 student would you like to read it ","yeah i'd like to read it but also i wanted to say that i went to nasa and so i know that i use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff "
5912,140.1,Chris,,"did you go to the one in texas or florida did you go to the john f kennedy center or ","the john f kennedy center "
5914,140.1,Chris,,,"the space center in florida with my dad i went with my dad "
5916,140.1,Chris,,"oh so i think that's the one named after president kennedy was it fun ","it was a lot of fun we got to see a lot of space shuttles and astronaut space chutes and all of the different ways that they can breathe upon in space "
5920,120.3,Chris,,"so paragraph three who would like to read three ","yeah you're welcome i can read it ok "
5922,120.3,Chris,,,"that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight eye you need a scientific microscope to look really closely "
5924,110.1,Oliver,,"oh good good job great job all of you class i appreciate all of you class volunteered to read and you've all done a very good job ok so let's get through if do you class have like a highlighter or a pen or pencil ","oh yeah i'm sorry to interrupt i know this was really really short and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you really just took some time to really listen to every single one of us and i mean i didn't say anything but you really listen to class sharing their ideas and that was really nice thank you "
5928,110.1,All,,,"i'm hi i hi "
5930,220.1,Luis,,"so we've already read the text about the moon in class and i just want to talk to you class about some of your answers to your questions and try to see if we can discover more answers and and think more deeply about this passage does that sound good to you class yes student ","trust me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
5932,110.3,Luis,,"oh that's okay well we can always learn new things about topics so you can help me you know help us learn more about it ","all "
5939,120.4,Oliver,,"right cool thank you student i'll need your help and so can you class show me your responses to the first question ","says we can't lift up our tablets off the desk but we can meet them um my answer was that nasa send to small machine and i said i'm scientists from craters full of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely up same thing i student "
5942,120.4,Farrah,,"the microscope premier ","yeah um i circled the last sentence it's in the in the story where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's at the end of paragraph three "
5944,230.3,Farrah,,"awesome okay so i just want to make sure that heard you out there so you're talking about the microscope that you can see the water with correct ","yeah yeah "
5948,120.3,Farrah,,"so in the text i think it was in ","we can see it on our tablets "
5961,310.1,Jazmin,,"but i like how you found a machine because it did ask for a tool and a machine in that question and i really like how you found that ","miss jennifer yes it's student um i had i wrote about my answer has about a small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
5964,120.4,Jazmin,,"oh yeah okay so can you read me your answer again sometimes it's hard to keep up with so many i can't see him ","yeah um so this is student student can i my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
5971,230.1,Jazmin,,"oh it was a small machine but didn't have a specific name ","that was the sound in the text and the text messages machine called a lunar orbiter oh "
5976,230.2,Jazmin,,"what did they use the lame lit lunar orbiter for keep her in that sentence ","i'm okay i'm okay to investigate i'm good investigate "
5990,210.3,Jazmin,,"what will know by the number but like if somebody that didn't know what we were what this passage was even about how could they read the answer to this question and know that we're taught what we're talking about how could we restate that question ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest ticking i'm water "
5998,120.2,Chris,,"but we also our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","but i do like how you did that teacher it's me student i was thinking about the equipment because you talked about equipment in the question and i wouldn't have nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6006,150.1,Chris,,"i'm almost a start like a couple words of restate and i want somebody see if i can help me from the text finish that sentence does that sound good ","okay "
6008,120.2,Chris,,"so what if i put the equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon was ","orbiter "
6012,130.3,Farrah,,"nasa scientists used the lunar orbiter to investigate water on the moon that takes words from our sin it's am from our end i mean from our questions in its and from the senate's in the passage correct ","yeah "
6017,420.2,Farrah,,"the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon was a lunar orbiter it gives our reader more information and they can if they know nothing about the topic that helps them learn more about it doesn't it ","yeah yeah yeah good yeah "
6020,420.2,Oliver,,,"teacher yes it's it's me i'm sorry but it's time for them "
6024,420.2,,,,"yeah it was lots of fun "
6030,120.2,Luis,,"so question two is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable okay that's our question to ","okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
6032,110.3,Luis,,"oh well i really need you to stay in our class and and you can help me with like information and things okay ","yeah okay i can do that "
6042,210.3,,,"let's see let me think about that how it is so you feel it is valuable but not for a while can you go a little deeper and tell me why was it not going to be valuable for a while ","because they said in the end of the story making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that's like i that's going to take a long time "
6048,210.3,Jazmin,,"um you know trying to think about if those were issues how it could be important now try to think about that next time okay yes student ","i'm still kind of confused "
6051,230.1,Jazmin,,"what's your quick what's what are you i'm sure ","well i think i i think i answered the question this time and i added more detail to my answer "
6061,210.1,Chris,,"i can't really can't carry ","yeah yeah i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt i was just gonna say that's what i said in my answer "
6068,230.1,Luis,,"and Luis Can you tell me a little bit about your answer. You said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen. So how can that make it valuable. ","wow i mean you that that's okay so i saw that in a story and that seemed like that was important "
6073,420.3,Oliver,,"What oxygen can be good for and what how'd you drink, we get four or what I can be put back together. And he says, ","i read i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
6079,110.3,Luis,,"Oh, that would be neat when it that that that's only four years away. ","I'm okay. Yeah. So I read I read that sentence after after the one that i said and it says that astronauts could breathe oxygen so i mean it seems like that's pretty crucial "
6086,210.4,Farrah,,"the oxygen and the hydrogen are not as same as water but what's something else that they can be used for ","oh it says oxygen and it could also be used as rocket fuel Um, so that you can like go up to the moon. out like you're on the moon oh "
6088,210.4,Farrah,,,"oh yeah yeah they use it to go home "
6095,150.1,Oliver,,"we have a lot of good information and so so we've decided and ","reach every reader it's me student "
6102,150.1,Oliver,,,"i was just looking it's me student i was looking at the clock and i realized that it's time for us to go to lunch well yeah i did want to say that i appreciate for how you explained what i needed to work on me and student that we should add more details to our answer and then i did listen to when you you told student and student that they were on the right track or their answers and so i feel like you really made us feel valued and kind of helped give give me some suggestions for what to do next time "
6104,150.1,Oliver,,,"yeah thanks so much i'll see you again next time "
6109,150.1,Luis,,,"high up excuse me don't i shouldn't be unless i have already know all about space "
6112,230.1,Luis,,"well i bet you do know a lot about space specifically and what you said why did you talk about oxygen tanks as the equipment ","because i know that i'm to go to the mon astronauts have to use oxygen tanks because they can't breathe on the moon without it "
6119,230.1,Chris,,"all right student so you talked about ","um yeah well cuz the question asked about water on what you were saying student and i i saw in the first paragraph that they said that they found water deep in the craters so um yeah so that's why "
6125,230.1,Jazmin,,"and Jazmin. So you specified that they use small machines. Why did you, why did you look for. Why did you say that they use small machines. ","well because i was looking for the name of up the equipment um and so i i only saw two things in the arm the story but machine i know his equipment and then they say a microscope at the end but i know that that one wasn't like to discover the water they were they were saying you could use it but they didn't say you they did use it so that's how i figured that the one in paragraph two was the right one "
6127,310.1,Jazmin,,"Good. You found exactly where you should be looking at by that word machine there. ","i don't "
6129,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answers wrong "
6131,230.3,Jazmin,,"okay so let's let's think about your answer so you said they use microsoft's correct ","all "
6134,230.1,Jazmin,,"so why did you say they use microscopes ","because that's what they used to look for water "
6138,230.3,Oliver,,"student you said you found the same exact answer as i'm student is that right ","uh huh "
6143,120.4,Luis,,"so student tell me what ","okay um so yeah um there's a bunch of there's two different things where they're talking about equipment in here um so in paragraph two they talk about the lunar orbiter and then paragraph three they talk about the microscope so that's equipment to but um and they both talked about water though in both of the paragraphs "
6152,310.1,Luis,,"good you found the equipment they talked about really really good ","it says to discover what what equipment data scientists use to discover the water Okay let me see. "
6155,120.4,Jazmin,,"while you're thinking i'm going to answer class my question what did you need student what was your question ","oh it wasn't a question it's just that i found the rest of the sentence it says they be such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate i'm vulnerable at them and south pole and look at it so yeah "
6160,130.2,Chris,,"does the rest talk with student about because he's trying to find which one discovers the microscope or the lunar orbiter i think you have the answer so talk with student and help him discover which one it is ","ok ok i'll miss miss haley i know that um but i went to nasa so i know that that they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks answer to "
6163,110.3,Chris,,"that is awesome that you know all the extra stuff and we're just trying to learn about the water so you know so much more you're going to add some equipment to your ","yeah yeah "
6170,120.4,Oliver,,"alright student did you find something else ","um well i found the same thing not even was saying but they have also have a small machine called the lunar orbiter um but i thought one is talking about i spend only in paragraph one paragraph three or they're really talking about the water Like frozen water. Oh. frozen Oh yeah, yeah, I got so "
6174,120.4,Farrah,,"good okay so i think paragraph two is really important so student i asked you to do something so did you ","um okay yes so so i looked i looked because i was also i was listening to what you are seeing a student and to death to and um so i guess the answer is that um it was a lunar orbiter because they were they were looking you use a microscope to look at the water but you said what they were looking for i guess um but i guess i mean i know that because i heard you were telling it to like to student and and then "
6179,120.4,Luis,,"all right student have you talked it out ","uh huh yeah yeah i got it now i am yeah i got it "
6182,120.4,Oliver,,"okay so tell me what you got ","me my family i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did want to say thank you so much for talking to each one of us about our kind of what we didn't understand and and then trying to help us get it better "
6184,120.4,All,,,"okay bye "
6192,120.3,Luis,,"oh gosh remind me other questions man ","i'm i'm looking for the question i just wanted to remind you that my dad to actually an astronaut "
6194,110.1,Farrah,,"is awesome student ","okay the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
6197,230.1,Farrah,,"okay very good you said no because not not for a long time why did you say not for a long time ","because it's gonna take a while for us for the astronauts to be able to find out if it's if it is valuable or not "
6199,410.1,Farrah,,"but is the question asking is it right now. ","let me look at it "
6203,230.1,Luis,,"so student the water can be you said that water can be split into two parts why did you tell me water can be split into two parts ","um because i found it in the story and i know you told me last time that i have to look into it look in the text for my answers and not just because i know it already and so it comes right after the first sentence that says water could be useful so i figured that's probably where you get the answer is after the first sentence "
6208,210.3,Luis,,"Is the fact that water can be split telling us anything about if it's good or not to have in space. Does that tell us ","is this convincing "
6213,210.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah well i was thinking about the water on the moon and well it could be valuable for us to have like a moon card you know so we could grow things on the moon "
6220,110.4,Jazmin,,"you are exactly right ","well they were talking about it i'm paragraph one but um oh i don't remember "
6224,120.1,Jazmin,,"go ahead and read rethink about your answer there for ","i see it okay it says future astronaut oh "
6228,120.1,Jazmin,,,"well it's a future astronauts could drink this water so then i was thinking okay like we need water to drink in order to live so um so yeah that's why i said "
6231,230.3,Jazmin,,"what did you say before you told me that what was the first part you just read there ","um that future astronauts could drink the water "
6233,230.1,Jazmin,,"mm hmm so that would be good what it is that does that convince you that it would be good to have the water ","oh yeah yeah it'd be good so that they could drink it oh yeah yeah that sounds good "
6237,230.1,Chris,,"student you talk to me about water being heavy why did you choose to talk to me about that ","well all because that was in the in the first the first part and the the teacher our english teacher said that usually the first paragraph is where you're going to find the important information "
6244,230.1,Oliver,,"they you said they're not ready yet why did you say they're not ready yet ","um well because at the end it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they will need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so i mean they don't have all of that stuff yet so so clearly they they are not ready for for getting water off the moon "
6250,210.2,Farrah,,"so what is valuable mean maybe that's what we need to ask ourselves so what does it mean to be valuable student ","valuable means like something that's really important like um um yeah something that's important "
6253,120.2,Farrah,,"important to have water on the moon ","um yeah i mean like like student said out people need to be able to drink water um so yeah that's valuable "
6256,230.2,Chris,,"so here's an did you find specifically where that waters heavy at ","your research be heavy on the spaceship the space shuttle "
6259,130.2,Farrah,,"good so student so what did student you say about the water ","um he said the waters heavy if it's on the space of the spaceship "
6261,130.2,Luis,,"So then Luis Would it be valuable to have this water and in space, so we don't have to lug it from Earth to the Moon. ","um yeah yeah that'd be great because you know if i have to carry water might my arms and be tired "
6263,230.3,Oliver,,"yeah so we're saving saving some energy for that space shuttle ","was harrowing "
6266,230.3,Oliver,,,"it's time for us to go to lunch but i understand now because you kept telling us to look up a word in the question so i do appreciate that you kept on challenging and it helped me kind of think about maybe how i got to look up a question a little bit more maybe next time "
6271,230.3,Oliver,,,"yeah me too hi no i was just saying hi "
6273,230.3,Luis,,,"i actually i do have a question um i don't think i should be on this class i already know all about space "
6277,110.3,Luis,,"well you know i liked your response the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ","okay because there isn't any gravity i mean there isn't gravity in space but they're also isn't any oxygen and trees and carbon dioxide so the site so the astronauts have to wear these oxygen tanks in order to breathe when they're up in space so they have they have a whole a whole space suit and then in their space suit they have like a helmet and then breathe out carbon dioxide can go out and then oxygen can come in so that they don't like suffocate in space "
6280,110.1,Luis,,"that's really cool student ","um i'll me let me look down um water on the moon yeah water on the moon "
6286,230.2,Jazmin,,"what is this what was the small machine called ","i'm not sure "
6288,210.4,Jazmin,,"Why don't you look at the first sentence and paragraph two, ","okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the small machine is called a lunar orbiter "
6290,230.2,Jazmin,,"good and so you said they sent this machine so what did this machine do ","um investigate "
6296,210.4,Jazmin,,"it does investigate but what does it investigate read that second sentence again and tell me what the lunar orbiter investigates ","okay this will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater i still don't understand why my answers wrong Oh, oh, okay. This lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater. well it's going to land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
6298,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay so it lands where ","on the moon "
6300,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay and you said so this lunar orbiter looks for what deposits ","it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
6307,230.2,Chris,,"um you so talk to me about that how much water did they find ","um oh okay i'm not really sure like exactly like the amount like how many gallons or anything but i mean i got it from from the story that they found like a lot of water "
6310,210.4,Chris,,"where does it say they found a lot of water let's look at that first paragraph does it say anything about finding a lot of water ","rapidly rereads paragraph one to himself oh yeah because it says a water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so it's like you know like deep "
6315,210.3,Chris,,"but it just says that they found evidence that there was water not that they found a lot of water they just not evidence meaning that they seen water there does that mean that there's a lot ","i guess i guess not if it's just evident to not the water um but you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like how student was saying but also masks and suits too Number three? "
6317,210.3,Chris,,,"let me see number three "
6319,210.3,Chris,,,"that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6321,210.3,Farrah,,,"that was my answer "
6324,210.3,Oliver,,,"well that was my answer too um student "
6326,230.1,Oliver,,"so student you said that was your answer too so that's awesome can you tell me what that means ","yeah i can because they're talking about how you need a microscope to look really closely at the water and so and a microscope is basically a scientific tool but the scientific tools also equipment "
6331,230.1,Oliver,,"okay so it is an equipment what does this equipment do if i put something under a microscope what does it do ","it helps you look at stuff Oh, oh, I'm sorry, teacher, I just heard the bell. That means that it's time it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you took time with with class to kind of ask questions and listen to everybody's ideas um wasn't really cool class "
6333,230.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
6336,230.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just wanted to say like i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class "
6339,220.1,Luis,,"we want to really focus on what it says and our article today we want to learn more details about scientists especially on the moon ","okay sounds good "
6343,230.1,Farrah,,"so when you are listening and answering this question how did you get to that answer ","okay so when i looked at was i was thinking okay so what equipment did they use to discover the water right so what i saw was like microscope i thought that would be what you'd have to use because they say that the water is microscopic "
6346,210.2,Farrah,,"our question specifically says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","like other than other than equipment like discover "
6353,210.4,Farrah,,"so did i need um you said that they needed the microscope to look really closely so did they use a microscope to find it or just a look at it ","um i guess i still understand why my answer is wrong because they it sounds like they had to use the microscope to see it so how could they discover if they didn't see it Oh, so they have to find the first "
6357,120.3,Chris,,"and in our text when we look at our texts let's all look at our text ","oh yeah i think you answered my question thank you "
6362,210.4,Jazmin,,"Let's use evidence from our text. ","they sent this small machine so it's this small machine "
6364,210.4,Jazmin,,"paragraph two said they sent a small machine does that small machine have a name ","yes it's the lunar orbiter "
6371,520.1,Oliver,,"so when we're answering questions like this again what's something that we need to make sure we do when we're answering the question ","well i guess i'm not sure i guess think about it Um, well, you asked us to look closely for the equipment. Right. And like look at what was using to discover the thing "
6375,510.1,Luis,,"we looked very closely at our text we looked for those keywords ","um yeah i guess i was gonna say kind of the same thing like we look for the keywords right but i guess i'm not totally sure like what are the keywords "
6377,510.1,Farrah,,,"um yeah so i guess what i found is that the keywords were equipment and like you had to also look at discover and see like that those were the important words we eventually had to find "
6379,150.1,Luis,,"does that answer your question student ","yeah i guess you know how do you find them "
6382,130.2,Chris,,"student do you want to answer luis's question ","oh i'm kind of had a different idea i was just thinking like you i went to nasa so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like masks and oxygen tanks and suits so like why wasn't that maybe an answer "
6386,410.2,Chris,,"well that wasn't an answer because in our text it didn't talk about that ","oh so it's just stuff that we read not stuff that we knew Oh, that makes sense. "
6388,410.2,Oliver,,,"yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for being with us "
6391,220.1,Luis,,"all right so i see that you have all um did your best and answering the question and some of you really went into detail pulling out specific sentences from the text but we want to get this specific answer so remember the discussion question is yes student ","um yeah so here's the thing i don't really think i need to be in this class because i know all about space already so i don't really need any help with this stuff "
6393,110.3,Luis,,"okay well maybe you can help us have help us with the other students understanding of space and we can pull from details from the text just to reaffirm your knowledge and what your prior knowledge is ","okay that sounds good "
6399,210.4,Farrah,,"alright so um can class tell me what paragraph did they think that gave the most information about finding water on the moon ","um so i would say that um i think it's the third paragraph in the third paragraph they say that on the water they found this microscopic and you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6402,110.2,Farrah,,"and it does say that um does it so are we using the microscope to find the water or to just look at the water that has been found ","um well okay so i i'm not really sure why my answer might be wrong because i think the answer is that the microscope is what they use to to find the water you know what i mean tey had to look at the water to see it "
6405,130.1,Farrah,,"well you're right they do they do need to use the microscope to look at the water to see it ","Yeah, I think that sort of makes sense. I feel like, well, so how did they, how did they find the water if they didn't use the microscope to find it. "
6410,130.2,Farrah,,"okay well let's ask your other classmates ","um well let's see uh no i don't think there's anything about a machine "
6413,210.4,Jazmin,,"Did any of you find anything about a certain machine or equipment they used? ","so what i saw that nasa used small machine and so i think that's something that they said that they were using to find like to discover the water you know what i mean like that was something that they looked at "
6418,230.2,Jazmin,,"so does this whole machine is it given a name do we see any place where it's given a name at ","Yeah, so it's the Lunar Orbiter. Like it means to like find something or like, yeah, like to find something or to see something or to study something "
6424,210.4,Chris,,"well we don't know for sure yet what they're going to investigate so let's look at the second sentence in that paragraph ","um yeah so i kind of got like i was sort of thinking um like i was wondering um well i feel like i like did they use like spacesuits and stuff so i feel like that might be missing from the from the the reading or something like because they have to use like spacesuits to go out and space "
6427,210.3,Chris,,"but the whole the whole thing that this article is about was about water on the moon do you think that the spacesuit could help you find water or is it just a tool the that the astronauts had on them to protect them ","oh so like so like what it's used for so like the spacesuits are just like to protect but they use other stuff to like find it and study it is that right "
6432,210.3,Jazmin,,,"so we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for taking the time to work with us today and especially like i really wanted to thank you for being so patient with us and our answers and like um like you really made us feel valued like when we were talking and had different ideas like you made sure that we knew that like our ideas were still worth listening to and that's really special so thank you so much for that "
6435,210.3,Oliver,,,"hi "
6437,210.3,Oliver,,,"oh we're good we're really excited to work with you "
6439,210.3,Luis,,,"i don't think i should be in this class like i already know all about space like all this stuff and i don't think i really have any problems like figuring it out "
6441,150.1,Luis,,"okay well let's just worked work together for a little bit and let's just see where we get okay ","okay "
6444,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so let's go over some of our answers student do you want to give your answer ","oh yeah okay so i said that a scientist would need to use a microscope "
6447,230.1,Farrah,,"would you like to share how you found that or why you chose microscope ","yeah um so when i was looking at like when i was looking at the beginning i was thinking like what equipment the scientists use right and microscope jumped out as like i know what i use microscopes in class so i know that you have to use them and it says microscopic in the reading it says that things are really small so you'd have to use a microscope "
6450,310.1,Oliver,,"very good i love how you are reading very closely and paying attention to those very big words very good ","um yeah so i have the same answer i student so i thought it was the microscope and i guess for me i guess it was kind of the same thing i figured when i read through the microscope was the only piece of equipment that i saw like when i was reading so i guess that could be the only answer "
6452,230.1,Oliver,,"okay well can you tell me why you might have chose that answer what made that microscope stick out to you ","i'm not really sure like i feel like i guess it's just because it's a piece of equipment and i know that like we're we're working on the small class so we can we can kind of get the right answer but i'm not really sure why my answer is wrong "
6456,120.4,Chris,,"and student can you tell us what you think the answer is and what you found in the text ","so i was saying basically that there were craters like full of water on all this water "
6459,230.2,Chris,,"but why did you choose that out of the out of the tags ","i guess because when i looked at the text what i was thinking was basically like i was seeing that they were saying that there was all this ice in the craters and so i thought like well that's all the water so when they we were asking about finding water i was like well there's the water "
6462,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what did you find in the text ","basically nasa sent this small machine and that was what was like what found all the water "
6466,120.4,Luis,,"and then student you said that you knew a lot about space i bet you really enjoyed this reading then what did you find out that nasa used ","um well i guess i mostly was thinking like about what i already do so i guess i didn't read it that closely because i was like i already know this like they use like space suits and gloves and i've been to nasa so i know that they use like oxygen tanks masks and suits like to go to space "
6472,130.3,Oliver,,"but the microscope is used to see the little particles of water okay ","Unfortunately, we have to go on to the next group, but thank you. "
6475,130.3,Oliver,,,"yeah "
6480,130.3,Luis,,,"no i just wanted to say my dad's an astronaut "
6482,130.3,Luis,,,"yeah "
6487,130.3,Farrah,,,"um i guess i was looking really close but i guess i still kind of see that it's a microscope because that was what i saw "
6490,120.4,Oliver,,"student what did you see why you were reading ","um i guess i saw the same thing cuz i i just kept seeing microscope and i kept thinking about microscopes for some reason "
6495,120.4,Chris,,"student how about you why you read read your story what did you find ","well okay so i tried to focus on the equipment and so instead of i realized my my answer was like about like the water so i i was looking at was like okay so like what equipment and i couldn't decide i thought maybe it was the microscope or maybe it was the lunar orbiter i didn't know "
6498,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay very good observation while you were reading good job student ","well i guess i still think my answer is right that nasa used a small machine to get to the water "
6501,110.1,Luis,,"okay very good ","i did i did read it i did read it i just i just kept thinking about all those like spacesuits and all that you know "
6509,110.1,Chris,,"but each one of you did a fabulous job reading and looking at all the information and taking it in so really good job class very proud of each and every one of you yes student ","i i am we go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for really thoughtfully work with us because you help me to understand like how my thinking led to you know to the first answer and why it wasn't quite the right answer and you you made me feel really value and i think class felt really valued and felt like you know what i mean like that you appreciated what we were saying so i just wanted to thank you because it was really nice to have that so thank you so much "
6513,110.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you we're excited to work with you "
6516,110.1,Luis,,,"um okay so here's here's the thing like i don't think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space and i know all this stuff and like i don't think i really need any help with this stuff "
6518,110.1,Luis,,"okay well there may be somebody here that does so let's all just take our turns and we'll see where it goes okay ","okay "
6521,120.3,Farrah,,"so i think we all need to reread the passage okay one more time i'm going to give you about two minutes to read over it and then we're going to come back and look at our answers again okay ","we can read super fast so we're done "
6528,120.2,Farrah,,"what equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay so i think um i think the answer is the microscope they said that in in paragraph three you need a micro a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6530,110.1,Farrah,,"good job student so once you reread it you found a different answer correct ","well that was i'm sorry this was student that was my answer from the beginning "
6533,110.1,Farrah,,,"but i think it was still that's okay um so i still think it's the microscope and i'm not sure like why my answer might be incorrect i don't really know "
6537,210.4,Oliver,,"okay paragraph one says that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","yeah we've used it in science class before "
6539,230.1,Oliver,,"wow what were you using it to find ","um we were looking at dna like we did a like a like a swab of our cheek and we were looking at like dna cells it was really interesting "
6545,230.2,Jazmin,,"what else do you think they would use be looking for on the moon ","i think that they would use i think that the answer is that they're using the small machine and the small machine is what they're using to discover the water i'm not sure if the microscope is what they're discovering with so i'm not quite sure if farrah's right or if i'm right "
6552,210.4,Chris,,"do you yeah okay let the reread end of that paragraph it talks about what kind of small tool scientific tool that they would use ","no no i don't need help but i did have a question "
6555,210.4,Chris,,,"okay so i was thinking that um i went to nasa with my dad and we studied like all of these like different things that like um like the astronauts use like oxygen tanks and spacesuits and like i was wondering like like that was my answer well i mean know my answer was about the craters but like i think that like maybe we could use the oxy like they could use oxygen tanks to find it also "
6557,230.2,Chris,,"okay but what does the reading tell us you possibly could use oxygen tanks but what does it tell us in the story ","um i guess it doesn't really say anything about like i'm like really about like the um using like space suits and stuff i guess that was like from like my understanding "
6561,120.3,Oliver,,"all right well let's uh we are actually i'm gonna let some friends take turns reading who would like to read first ","um sure okay so scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert because it has no atmosphere like we have on earth however they used to believe that there was no water on the moon now they know this is not true scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
6567,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay who would like to read the second one ","so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigat the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crator these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day "
6571,110.1,Luis,,"very good who wants to read the last paragraph ","okay okay so okay so yeah like um okay this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic many wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
6574,120.2,Jazmin,,"right who heard in that story what they use what was the name of that scientific tool ","yes scientific tool in the third paragraph with the microscope "
6578,110.2,Jazmin,,"good job student did class hear that while student was reading ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today like you were very patient with us as we were all giving our answers and we all had very different answers and you were really thoughtful about like listening to us and helping us be able to say our answers about what we thought like sometimes we stress out our science teacher and you were so patient and it really made us feel confident to like share answers so thank you so much "
6580,110.2,Oliver,,,"hi "
6582,110.2,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you "
6585,140.1,Luis,,"so what are some thoughts that you've had on the text prior to answering any of the questions ","um so i just wanted to say um i already kind of know like all about space and like i kind of like know like all this stuff so i don't think i need to be in this class "
6587,220.1,Luis,,"well that's a very big statement because i don't even know all about space space is so broad and there's so many unanswered questions that i think that you have be eager to learn about i didn't even know about water on the moon so this though you might think that you might know some of this stuff i'm sure there's something new that you might could gain from it so i think it's very beneficial that you're in this class ","yeah that's that's a good point "
6590,120.2,Jazmin,,"it said what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon now have class already thought of your answers for this question ","yes we did we all yeah "
6594,120.2,Farrah,,,"okay so basically um i think that the answer is they used the microscope because they that's the science tool they talk about in paragraph three "
6597,110.2,Jazmin,,"that was a wonderful answer does class else want to add their answer to it ","and so basically um for me like i thought that they used to small machine to discover the water "
6601,210.4,Farrah,,"so if we look at our passage right here in the first stanza it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines does that stanza to say anything about any equipment ","no i guess not "
6605,210.4,Farrah,,"This lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater. These ice deposits are very small. Was there anything in that stanza that might have referred to equipment being used? ","yes that's where they talk about the small machine that they sent to the moon Okay, so here's my question. I'm, I'm trying to understand, like, why my answer might not be correct to say thought they use a microscope to see the water "
6610,210.4,Chris,,"so the scientists needed to use tools and equipment to discover the water on the moon and they use that by starting with the small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate ","um yeah so i was just wondering like my dad took me to nasa and we went and studied like and looked at all like the stuff that people wear there and like the spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all this stuff like don't we need that stuff to find the water like i think that maybe we need that stuff too "
6619,110.3,Jazmin,,"so when you got to see all of those things that nasa you were able to see some of the space suits some of the tools and equipment that they use ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we could lunch i just wanted to take a moment i just wanted to thank you for working with us today you are so patient and so positive with all of us it really makes us feel like we can share our ideas with you like because you were so like helpful with like the different answers that we had and sometimes we really frustrate our science teacher and he says we give him stress hives and you were so just like calm and and just very thoughtful so i just wanted to thank you so much for that "
6622,110.3,Luis,,,"okay excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
6636,110.1,Chris,,"okay so student you said in one of your responses that scientists found craters full of water on the moon ","So I did a good job in finding out where the water is I, I gotta find out what what discovered the water "
6639,120.3,Jazmin,,"so as we continue into paragraph two it states nasa sent a small machine now student yes ","my answer came from paragraph two i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
6643,130.1,Jazmin,,"so you said that nasa sent a small machine and that is correct the you have to send your small machine in order to discover the water ","Called the lunar orbit Jupiter. "
6645,150.1,Jazmin,,"a lunar orbiter so what machine discovered water ","and the lunar orbiter "
6648,150.1,Jazmin,,"absolutely so do you understand how your answer was right but we could have made it just a little bit more detail ","i just have to add called lunar orbiter "
6650,150.1,Chris,,,"i didn't see it in the story i'm in the story but i just heard you tell i'm student what it was so no i know that it was the lunar orbiter "
6652,150.1,Chris,,"it is the lunar orbiter and we're just gonna keep going and talking about our answers and figuring out where we came up with these answers and how we could have got them better ","better okay okay teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6655,210.2,Chris,,"right and they do use a lot of equipment such as that but our question specifically wants to know what equipment they use to discover water ","Yeah yeah "
6661,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah so let's talk about that just a little bit so what made you choose that as your answer ","the question was asking about equipment and so i was looking for where the worst equipment and so the microscope i know his equipment and also i was looking for where they talked about water and in this paragraph they talk about the microscope as a scientific tool to look at the water "
6663,210.3,Farrah,,"So your answer talked about a microscope being the tool use, but what did the microscope do did it discover water or was it used to look at the water ","used it to look at the water "
6665,210.3,Farrah,,"yet that's right they use it to examine the water so if they're using a microscope to examine the water is that our equipment we used to discover it ","i guess no i guess not "
6667,150.1,Farrah,,"right so our microscope is used to look at our water but we've already discovered our water with the lunar orbiter does that make sense now ","yeah i guess i guess so i feel like oh yeah cuz discover is different from look at "
6669,150.1,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you again later "
6671,150.1,Oliver,,,"alright "
6674,120.2,Luis,,"all right you class so we're going to look at our second question that we have from the passage in the question states is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable yes student ","okay i think i got this all figured out so now i'm all good "
6679,220.1,Luis,,"yeah wonderful buddy but we're going to talk just a little bit more about text evidence and how it can help us with our questions so i want you all to look at question number two ","Okay. um i'm going to say water is a big important word "
6689,210.3,Farrah,,"so it's already telling us it's valuable now student and student i know that you saw on here that you weren't quite sure if it was a valuable resource or not but do you see in our heading and in our first line how we can already start identifying that it is a valuable resource ","but i'm still kind of confused "
6694,210.4,Chris,,"it then says water is heavy so when you're if you are going up into space would you want to carry all these loads of water in your spacecraft or would it be really convenient if the water was already at the moon ","well i said that thing about them not being able to drink it so i think i'm right too yeah so that's why i put that one as my answer so i think i'm right "
6699,210.4,Luis,,"so if we keep going into paragraph five it says water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen now i'll continue we have to use oxygen in order to breathe so if water can provide oxygen would that be a important and valuable resource to have on the moon ","that's the thing i said i said that one "
6702,110.1,Luis,,"yes good job student ","i mean yeah cuz you know class needs to breathe that's that's that's like the most important thing that you can have in life is breathing "
6706,210.4,Chris,,"so do you see that there's a few possible answers to this question because the text gives us some examples ","i read that there could be a base on the moon in 2024 "
6710,110.1,Chris,,"Possibly. Who knows but that would be really cool now. ","reacher every reader well i mean that's why i'm still confused because i did you something from the text but you told me it was wrong yeah it looks like you know me and student and student add some stuff from the text i don't know where class were talking about student and student "
6715,420.2,Luis,,"So we want to be as detailed as possible when we answer our questions so that we have all the information that we need in our response. ","Okay, so I guess what you're saying is that, me and Farrah were right too. So there you go. Chris, hmm. Um, but we just have to add more words. So all I have to say no it's not ready. Um, they would need to study the multiverse and build new equipment okay so i added more details is that as a good answers i got enough "
6720,420.2,Oliver,,"So we want to make sure that we're answering the question as fully and descriptively as possible. Does that help better explain it to you Oliver. ","okay um yeah okay thanks i just i guess you're saying i'm not like i'm but i i used i added more stuff from the text and my answer but i didn't answer the question "
6722,420.2,Oliver,,"correct you got to make sure that you answer the question and when you answer your question you got to make sure you add all of your details ","okay "
6727,510.1,Oliver,,"because those are a lot of key details in there that could give you some really good text evidence so that's what you need to do you want to find details that go along with your question and could possibly support your answer ","all thanks teacher it looks like a time for us to go to lunch but i do appreciate how you you asked me a lot of questions to help me think about well how i i came to my answer and and and how you explain what what i need to work on which is like looking highlighting some of the arm but the headings and more details throughout the whole story i think to find more evidence to match the question "
6729,510.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
6733,510.1,Luis,,,"hi i'm excuse me master clement "
6735,510.1,Luis,,,"be on this class i already know all about space "
6743,230.1,Luis,,"your thought process was for answering that ","well well like you said you know i know a lot about space and i know that you can't breathe on when you go to the moon so they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon "
6751,130.3,Luis,,"but that isn't necessarily the equipment they use to discover the water ","um okay well i don't know i don't know that one "
6756,120.1,Jazmin,,"figure out what what what other equipment or machines were used in the in the process that might help you a little bit better ","Okay. i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
6768,420.2,Chris,,"to answer them if you're having a conversation like you would name the machine and tell them how they used it so that's kind of the answer you should be looking for in answering these attacks ","yeah yeah i i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
6770,110.3,Chris,,"right i'm super jealous that you had nasa but ","me and my dad went "
6790,510.1,Oliver,,"maybe like a chronological timeline of events in a text so if you broke down the text and circled like what happened first and then what happened and then what happened you might be able to find a more suitable answer to the question ","i'm sorry mr clemens i know it's been a short time but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class "
6793,510.1,Oliver,,,"ok so we'll see you later "
6796,510.1,Farrah,,,"how are you we're excited to work with you today "
6799,510.1,Farrah,,,"okay yeah you can just pretend like we're real students in the classroom and you can call on us or have us work however you like "
6802,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so i actually like i know all about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class because i don't really need the help "
6804,230.2,Luis,,"well you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen when responding to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon where did you find your answer from the text which paragraph ","um well i didn't really get it from the text a kind of just knew it so i didn't really like get it from the reading "
6811,230.2,Luis,,,"Okay, that, that makes sense. um like, we're looking for like machines or tools like in the text. um discover discover the water "
6816,230.2,Farrah,,"do you see a word that you would use in of those paragraphs just by skimming ","well i can i yeah i can look it up and try to see um i gotta kind of read it through i didn't read it very carefully i have a question it's student "
6818,230.2,Farrah,,,"okay so i was wondering um i said that the the the the tool used the equipment used to discover the water was a microscope but i'm trying to understand what my answer might be incorrect "
6822,410.2,Farrah,,"but your answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it doesn't answer the question exactly about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","Oh, OK. OK. "
6825,430.2,Oliver,,"you you just said i circled the same as student but you should voice your own answer not just piggybacking off of one of your fellow classmates so that i can help you better and also if you circled the same as to then you're still looking you still just caught a glimpse of a piece of equipment but you're you didn't really read what that piece of equipment was for or what it did so you also need to figure out what the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","ah ok i can do that "
6831,420.3,Chris,,"you should be looking for keywords like tool equipment or maybe machine to help you find what they used to discover the water ","yeah i think i think you're right on i didn't well because i was thinking like i was thinking about well okay this is a little bit of a different thing but it makes me wonder if like like like we're kind of like a like we we like have to use spacesuits like if we go up in in space like i went to nasa and like saw the exhibit and stuff so i guess i'm wondering like did they not have to use that equipment to discover the water "
6838,430.2,Jazmin,,"But there's, it's more descriptive. They talked more about the machine and we're trying to look at more at the detail of the machine. So what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. And you're right, it is a small machine. But what was the machine called and what did it do? ","it was the in the same sentence as this machine it says the lunar orbiter to investigate "
6841,430.2,Jazmin,,,"the lunar orbiter it lands at the south pole and it looks for ice deposits okay yes so so it does say pretty clearly like that's the thing that that found the water right "
6846,130.1,Oliver,,"mhmm good your answer just needed to be a little bit more whole you had a small piece of the answer ","um yeah kind of we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we went to lunch i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us because sometimes we can get really kind of wrapped up and confused about the answer but you were really clear in what you are saying and asking us to look at specific parts of the reading and also um you were very positive with us so we felt like we could still give an answer even if it wasn't correct so i just wanted to thank you "
6849,150.1,Luis,,"alright so you have all shared your responses and i can see that we have have different responses here yes student ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be on this class i am already know all about space "
6852,150.1,Luis,,"oh well there's so much more to learn space is so expansive right and so there's so much more to learn that's awesome that you like hearing about like learning about space but maybe ","all okay "
6857,420.1,Oliver,,"okay so i want you to look at your paper and i want you to circle the keywords in this question so circle maybe two keywords from this question i'll give you about 10 seconds to do that ","Oh, whoops you said two, I circled like four "
6860,420.1,Jazmin,,,"I said, and discover "
6864,230.3,Farrah,,"okay yeah and i agree with you student i think a equipment and discover and you may have circled other words as well but i think that we are looking for the equipment used to discover the water ","i did yeah and moon to "
6873,420.1,,,"i'll give you 10 seconds to think of some synonyms or words that are similar to each of those words so what's another word for equipment and what's another word for discover ","i said that equipment is a tool but i don't understand my my answer is wrong "
6889,120.1,Luis,,"and see if we can add to our answer or maybe even change it ","so um when i read it i read the thing where it talked about the microscope because i thought microscope was a tool just like student um yeah and i saw that an arm and in paragraph four they talked about a spacecraft um so that's an appointment true um so that's what i saw and most true well okay so i saw that they talked about a microscope in paragraph three with the water and i didn't really i saw a machine i guess the spacecraft yeah yeah spacecraft machine um yeah and microscope is is it my turn okay i think we're done "
6892,110.1,Chris,,"alright class i've heard some really great responses you class are doing a great job working together um let's see ","i want to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits to "
6903,130.2,Farrah,,"after that okay so you'll share with the class student ","well me and depth kind of set the same stuff we said that you know the microsoft the microscope is his equipment and then we said that we also saw in paragraph four they were talking about a spacecraft and we said that that was equipment to "
6906,210.2,Oliver,,"both pieces of equipment which one was used to discover the water or to find the water ","hey oh are you know teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch "
6911,120.4,Luis,,"what did you circle student ","well i i wanted i'm sorry i just wanted to say i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
6913,110.3,Luis,,"oh well that's really great that's that's awesome that you know all about space maybe you can add to our conversation ","okay okay so what i i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
6916,230.2,Luis,,"okay so let's um what what did you what kind of evidence did you circle in the text ","oh um i didn't actually circle anything because i already know a bunch of stuff about equipment that they use "
6921,120.3,Luis,,"as a class look back at paragraphs three and four how's that sound ","okay "
6925,230.2,Jazmin,,"you said that they sent a small machine what um what piece of evidence did you circle ","circle that at the beginning of paragraph to "
6929,120.1,Jazmin,,"all right student um what was what was your response ","excuse me i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
6933,420.2,Jazmin,,"You know you've, you found the piece of equipment that they used, but we have to be a little bit more specific here. ","okay "
6942,110.1,Oliver,,"and you said that they use a microscope so ","yeah i i found it on my own but since you had asked student first i was just trying to say that i had the same answer but i didn't like copy off for her talk to her to find it "
6951,420.1,Chris,,"or verbs in this question so i'll give you about ","i circled us and discover and that made me think about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits "
6961,210.4,Jazmin,,"at paragraphs three and four those are the ones i think we need to look at again ","i still think that the small machine is that what they used because you said discovery is like define and well it says that they used it to investigate and like a detective kinds of discovers things you know and they investigate so i still think it's in paragraph two "
6964,210.4,Oliver,,"in a large polar crater okay so you were right it's in a small machine but specifically the small machine was caled what ","yeah i was a lunar orbitre "
6970,110.4,Oliver,,"exactly right yes ","yeah sorry to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch i i wanted to say thank you for helping us understand some of the important words in the question and to try to see if i can help us find that in the text and i like how you valued class like i felt like you understood at least that i we all kind of we're trying to find the answer and that felt good "
6972,110.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's my question um so i know like all about space like i know all this stuff about space like i don't really think i need any help so i'm not really sure like why am i in this class "
6974,120.2,,,"oh well our discussion question today was what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","so in the texts in front of you called the moon is a desert "
6977,120.1,Luis,,"you can answer that question by reading it and you've given some great answers ","well i guess like i was wondering like do they use like oxygen tanks and do they use like that kind of stuff because like like that like seems like something they'd have to use but maybe they don't "
6979,110.1,Luis,,"all right ","i didn't really read very closely "
6983,120.3,Luis,,"let's look back at the text ","oh um yeah i didn't really read too closely i should probably look at it "
6986,120.3,Luis,,,"um yeah well i guess it's more of like kind of a comment i already know like all about space so i think i even need to be in this "
6990,120.4,Farrah,,"so i would appreciate it if you would just kind of listen and maybe you will learn something new so student can you read to me your answer about the question that was asked ","yeah ok so my answer was basically you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really close "
6994,310.1,Farrah,,"okay and i like that you use that wording scientific tool ","okay so i looked at the keywords in the question and i thought the keyword for equipment and discuss and when i looked at the reading what i saw was that the microscope was something they said that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it without a microscope so i was like well then you have to use the microscope you know what i mean "
7000,310.1,Oliver,,"i like that you use that word scientific tool great great job there ","um yeah so i would say i guess it was sort of similar but basically what i would say like in my own words is that like you use the microscope to see the water and like kind of what she said that it's microscopic so i was thinking that like how could you find the water or the i guess the ice that's like the frozen water how could you find it if you can't see it you know "
7003,420.2,Jazmin,,"so next time when we are asked a question instead of saying i answered it like student or a neighbor make sure you write an answer out instead of saying i found the same thing as my friend i want to hear what you found ","well i guess my question is that it still don't quite understand why my answer is wrong and i just was trying to figure it out "
7007,120.4,Jazmin,,"and what was your response what did you put ","a small machine "
7011,230.1,Jazmin,,"i think that we can add some more to your answer to make it a little bit stronger can you tell me why you put nasa send a small machine and nothing else ","so yeah so well okay so when i was reading i saw that oh okay so yeah i just looked at it again so are you seeing like i should say what the machine is "
7014,420.2,Chris,,"well it's always good to add detail to our answers and so the more detail we can provide with our answer the better or the stronger answer can be ","i went to nasa with my dad and when we were there we saw that scientists use masks and suits and oxygen tanks i was wondering i'm like it's not in the reading like did they use those to find the water "
7017,210.4,Chris,,"well let's remember that the title of our story ways water on the moon so yes astronauts do wear those as a protective measure so when they're on the moon they can survive because it's a really cool place and if they didn't wear those they could die ","Yeah, that does so like I need to use the evidence not like background knowledge. "
7020,210.2,Chris,,"our question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water ","Yeah okay that actually. Okay. That makes a lot more sense. So like it's. Yes. That makes sense. "
7022,210.2,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to the next class which were bummed about because we're having a lot of fun working with you but um thank you so much for working with us "
7025,120.4,Luis,,"student do you have a question ","um yeah well it's kind of more of like a thought i guess i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good "
7030,430.2,Luis,,"however if we were talking just about our reading passage those are not necessarily in there so can you come up with a new way to discuss how there is evidence that water on the moon could be valuable can you think about that and i'll come back to you ","yeah absolutely "
7034,230.2,Jazmin,,"and you talked about astronauts can use the water to stay hydrated and i did like how you said you cannot survive without water um where did you come up with that answer how did you find that answer ","okay so basically okay and let's see it's in the second reading the water is a valuable resource and i said in paragraph four it could be useful in lots of ways the astronauts could drink this water "
7037,210.4,Jazmin,,"great job is it just astronauts that need to survive with water or do we all need to survive with water ","yeah all living things need water "
7041,230.1,Chris,,"so that is true it does talk about water being heavy how come you responded with that ","so i was thinking when i was looking at it that well okay so i was thinking the waters heavy and you have to take it on the spaceship but maybe you could could get the water on the moon you wouldn't have to take as much water with you although i have to say i'm still a little confused about kind of like you and i mean like how it didn't quite answer the question "
7045,210.4,Chris,,"the whole reading she is talking about water on the moon so really we wouldn't have to bring water from earth it would be discovered on the moon and they would be using that water from the moon ","Yeah, I think it does. Yes, thank you. "
7047,120.4,Luis,,"sure and student i saw that your hand was up do you have a question ","um i forgot "
7053,230.1,Oliver,,"so we need to figure out yours and farrah's you kind of both have very similar responses so student oh no sorry student you talk you said no it's not ready yet so what do you mean by that ","um so i guess it's kind of it's kind of interesting so i when i mean it's not ready yet like the water that's on the moon isn't really ready for us to do yet so um it's kind of like it seems like it would be really hard like so they asked if there was convincing evidence and i thought it wasn't as convincing because it seemed like it would take a long time to work and even though i read that we're going to try to have a moon base on the moon by like 2024 or around then i kind of don't think that's gonna happen because they always say that you're going to like put stuff in space or we're going to go to mars but then it never happened and so i was thinking that like even though it might be valuable like maybe i don't think it would be for a long time "
7065,230.1,Farrah,,"you had responded similar and you had said no not for a long time so is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable and you responded with no not for a long time do you care to kind of explain your answer a little bit more ","yeah absolutely so i i wish i could unfortunately because you have to go but before we go over i really wanted to thank you for working with us and i in particular there were so many cool things that you were doing with us we were working together like first off you have to make sure that we were using evidence from the text whenever we gave an answer which was really cool and you asked us like all the time you asked like all of us like what what our thinking was like to the answers we have and i like class had really thought processes that they were able to share and you let us have time to explain like what her ideas for and that really made us feel valued and you you said that really thoughtful things to us that i think we're really true and like i think meant something to class right class yeah i think that like it was really cool working with you because i think we learned a lot about how to respond like more effectively questions like this so thank you so much thank you "
7067,230.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
7069,230.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing well thank you "
7071,230.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's kind of a question like um so i know all about space like all this stuff and i don't really think i should be in this class because i don't think i need any help "
7074,220.1,Luis,,"so work on all learn from each other and kind of discuss what we've read and if you have questions at the end teacher name will gladly to answer those okay ","okay that sounds good "
7078,120.2,Oliver,,"awesome so we're going to go over our reading passage that you all did water on the moon and so the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well we came to the same answer basically because she she was right i think i circled the same answer so like you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i agree with student "
7083,230.1,Oliver,,"so did you find that on your own prior to student writing that or did you kind of just copy that ","oh that's a that's a fair question um but i found it on my own we are we're kind of both looking separately OK, I can do that. "
7086,220.1,Farrah,,"a lot of you have really great responses but the reason why we're kind of in this small class is to kind of build off those responses so although it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon there's a little bit more that we could probably add to our answers to help you better does that make sense ","yeah i have a question um i was wondering if um like so my answer like if we're all in the class to work together on getting the more correct answer like i was wondering why my answer might be incorrect "
7088,220.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah this is student "
7090,220.1,Farrah,,,"no problem "
7094,420.2,Farrah,,"how do you think that we could have wrote our answer differently to include the question ","yeah definitely i think i know what you mean yeah "
7097,230.2,Farrah,,"but what are we looking closely for ","we're looking for water "
7099,210.4,Farrah,,"okay and in our texts did it talk about using a microscope that those astronauts or rather those scientists use ","in paragraph three it says um you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7103,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","yeah thank you "
7107,150.1,Jazmin,,,"so basically i was just gonna ask the question like so when i looked at it i thought okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i guess i guess i should have said lunar orbiter and i guess i'm wondering like is it the microscope or is it the lunar orbiter that found the stuff "
7111,150.1,Chris,,"student do you not remember reading that part ","no i do i do remember um i thought that there was like a bunch of water in the craters um but i did have a quick question "
7113,150.1,Chris,,,"yeah yeah of course "
7115,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay perfect so then in the second paragraph it talks about nasa using this small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so what they're doing is that they're using the orbiter to investigate the evidence that they found deep within those craters does that make sense ","yeah i think so "
7119,150.1,Jazmin,,"class student do you know what microscopic mean no ","well i think it means something really small "
7128,210.4,Oliver,,"and it also says in the last sentence is that they looked at a scientific tool called a microscope really closely so all of those tools that they've used helped discover that ","ok i should probably let have i should probably let student have this turn and yeah we just because unfortunately we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you before we had to leave sometimes our science teacher he says that we give him stress hives and you are so thoughtful and friendly in the way that you're asking us our questions and i think that i can speak for class and say that like i don't think class felt like um felt bad like if they had the wrong answer which is really important like sometimes we all feel really bad if we if we don't have the right answer so i just wanted to thank you for really like paying attention to us and being so kind in in thoughtful "
7131,210.4,Farrah,,,"yes we are "
7135,220.1,Luis,,"so what we can do is just kind of go around the room if you just raise your hand i'll call on you and then we can look at your response and kind of figure out where you came up with that response and see if we're saying is correct or if it could use a little work so if you will just kind of raise your hand and i'll call on you ","um so i was talking about like using like oxygen tanks and like stuff like that and um like i don't really know like if i should be in this class because i know all about space so i kind of feel like i know a lot of stuff about this "
7142,110.3,Luis,,"but like you said scientists do have to use oxygen up in space so they can survive ","I guess I didn't really like read it as closely as I could have "
7146,130.1,Chris,,"yeah maybe just pay a little bit more attention to the exact question but you were correct and your response to just didn't specifically answer the question ","um yeah so i kind of was um so my answer was um you would find that the scientists found like craters full of water on the moon "
7153,130.3,Chris,,"but like you said they did find water but we need to look specifically other question on how they found that water and it was with the machine called the lunar orbiter ","okay gotcha okay "
7155,130.3,Farrah,,,"um yeah so basically um i was just wanted i was just gonna ask like so my answer was um you know you need a scientific tool called a microscope which was in the in the reading but i'm i'm not quite sure what my answer it isn't right "
7161,210.1,Jazmin,,"you would need a microscope but what they the machinery they use what's called the lunar orbiter but you'd also need a microscope like you said to be able to view the water molecules deep in the craters ","so my question is then so i said that nasa sent a small machine and did i just like why was my answer not quite right "
7165,420.2,Chris,,"So that's the only thing I would add to yours. What you put was was correct, but your teacher may want you to be a little more specific. So you could just name the actual machine, and it was called the Lunar Orbiter. So you're not very far off just a little bit more specific. ","um yeah so i was just i was just thinking about like what you need in space and i was kind of thinking about luis's answer and like so my dad and i we went to nasa so i know that like if they're astronauts up there they have to use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and all that kind of stuff so um i was just curious like did they did they not have astronauts "
7170,210.1,Chris,,"but the the question specifically wants to know what equipment they had to use to find the water in the craters and so they didn't necessarily have to use the oxygen tank on their back for find the water they have to use oxygen tank so they can continue breathing and live ","oh okay yeah that makes sense so like you you to maybe they had to use like the equipment but it's not what they used to like find the water "
7175,110.2,Jazmin,,"correct they did have to use the equipment so student and you are both correct that they did have oxygen tanks but that's not specifically what they hadn't used to find the water and the craters ","actually unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i also wanted to say like to thank you for being so clear like with your response to our answers like sometimes we can frustrate our teachers a little bit because we're still working out you know like the answers as we go but you were very patient and you also were very clear and helping us understand like what we were trying to say so just wanted to thank you for that because not class does that "
7178,110.2,,,,"we're excited to work with you "
7181,110.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to say that like i don't think i should be in this class because i already know all about space "
7183,150.1,Luis,,"well i'm glad you you have a basic understanding of it but in this room we're just gonna learn a little bit more and you can broaden your knowledge on everything that involves space okay ","okay yeah i can do that "
7192,420.1,Farrah,,"all right so what i think we should do after looking at those answers is kind of look at the question itself and kind of determine some keywords that are in that question ","um i think the keywords are and discover "
7194,210.2,Oliver,,"good because we are wanting to know what specific equipment the scientists used to discover water there ","um yeah actually i agree with student i said equipment and discover as well "
7198,130.2,Jazmin,,"okay student do you agree also do you have something else to say ","yes i see discover a different answer than them and i'm confused why my answer is wrong "
7200,110.1,Chris,,"well looking at your answers like i said all of class did a decent job hang on one second let me ask student what do you what do you ever say buddy ","um well i was just gonna say like i i only underlined "
7207,410.3,Farrah,,"a piece of equipment but in the text it didn't really mention that the microscope helped discover water on the moon ","oh well i guess like what i thought about the you know about the microscope is that like they couldn't okay so in a text they said that they couldn't see the are acceptable microscope because it was so small but um i thought like how could they find it if they couldn't see it "
7209,210.4,Farrah,,"okay and that makes sense they do have to use the microscope to see it because it is so small but to find the water itself they didn't necessarily use the microscope when they found the water then the microscope came into play so they can actually view it does that make sense ","oh so they like something like studied the water "
7211,210.4,Farrah,,,"and another "
7213,150.1,Oliver,,"yeah and then i noticed that you put the same answer as student so does that make sense to you also buddy ","um yeah that makes sense so like they use something else to find the water and then they studied the water using the microscope "
7219,430.2,Chris,,"in that sense your answer doesn't fully answer the question you did put that they found water which is correct but you need to describe what equipment they specifically used to find that water does that make sense ","yeah i think i think it does like i guess my question is i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that and i guess like if i know that like even if it's not in the meeting like is that the answer to "
7226,410.1,Chris,,"however having that knowledge does help you with this overall topic but it's not specific to that question if that makes sense ","yeah i think i think that makes sense like so i'm supposed to like pull from the reading answer the question not from like what i what i knew before "
7229,420.2,Chris,,"yeah we want that specific evidence from the reading that we want to pull that straight out that shows we found the answer to that question student that is one thing i think that will help you if you really try to pull that answer out of what you're reading ","gotcha "
7233,130.1,Jazmin,,"All right, now Jazmin, you put NASA send a small machine and you're almost 100% right ","but i can do that she was caught the lunar orbit so is that was it the lunar orbiter was with the "
7236,210.4,Chris,,"okay and like you said class told me that were the keyword was the equipment to discover and then up in the text it specifically says nasa send a small machine called a lunar order order to investigate so does that make sense where we got that from ","yeah i think that doesn't make sense so okay so that's the answer that's the equipment that you to find the what like to discuss "
7238,130.3,Jazmin,,"yet specifically to find the water they use the equipment called the lunar orbiter now there's other equipment that's talked about in this text but specifically to find the water they use the lunar orbiter ","so we have to go to our next class that is so much for working with us "
7241,130.3,All,,,"hi "
7243,130.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's more of a statement so i think i got this all figured out now like thanks to the first thing that we covered so i think i'm all good "
7245,220.1,Luis,,"well i hope you're right but i think with we go through this second question will be able to make sure that we understand how to kind of really dive deeper into a question so we can find the evidence from the text way say sound good ","yeah i can stick around for that "
7252,420.1,Chris,,"okay so within that question just like we talked about in our first session what do you think are some keywords in there that we need to pull out before even worry about answering this question ","um okay so when i look at it i think that convincing evidence and valuable Um, okay. So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value. "
7258,130.2,Luis,,"all right does class have anything else say thanks important or is class else agree that convincing evidence and valuable role very important words ","um yeah i think for me when i was looking at it like i kind of thought that um well i guess i wasn't totally sure i thought maybe because i thought like what you could do with the water so i kind of think water might be important i guess i'm not sure "
7261,210.2,Luis,,"so water is an important word ","yeah "
7269,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay now if you go back into the into the text do you see anywhere in there that talks about you know how it could be valuable ","yeah i mean just we have a question oh yeah well i guess i'm sorry to jump in i just was still kind of confused about like actually we haven't really got to my ticket so i guess we can wait like "
7279,210.4,Oliver,,"you see anywhere that specifically talks about how water couldn't be valuable ","yeah there's um let's see yeah and the very first sentence right there yeah like and the very first sentence of the fourth paragraph it says water on the moon would be a valuable are very important resource i guess i think like we probably did the same thing like when we were talking about it i think what we were thinking was that well at least for me like i don't think that the water would be valuable yeah because i don't like i don't think that we can use it yet and so when they asked like is our convincing evidence like it it sort of made me think like it's not very convincing because we don't really know like how to use the technology exactly to wit so i kind of thought like you know what i mean like maybe it wasn't valuable yet "
7286,130.3,Oliver,,"so even though we're not using the water right now the implications of finding that water moving forward could be very beneficial to our astronauts and the spacecraft and everything of that matter ","yeah i guess that's true because i read that like there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and like they would definitely need water if i did that "
7293,210.4,Chris,,"let me just kind of build off that so by you saying they don't have to carry water what does that essentially mean they can you do with the water that's already there ","well they can pick it up on the moon and use that water than to fly around or like they don't have to take it from earth so i guess it would be by "
7303,210.4,Oliver,,"so that's less stuff they have to care or you know to bring with them on the spaceship so they can have room for more people more supplies and things like that so that's a very good response they have you got a question buddy ","um yeah well unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like there was a couple things in particular that were really cool like for example you really helped us to understand like what the question was asking for each of the questions and you really make sure that we use but that's like from the text when we were talking about our answers and like even more like you made us feel really valued and you explain like what we needed to work on like you know what i mean so that we could get a better or more complete answer and you gave us ideas for like you know what i mean what your concerns were and then like helped us to kind of find our way to to understanding it which was really cool and like that's not always the case so like thank you so much because i think like class in the class like feels like you know what i mean like we all understand it really well at this so thank you so much "
7306,210.4,Oliver,,,"we're good we'ere excited to work with you "
7308,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like i already know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class "
7311,220.1,Luis,,"because we're not just yeah we're not just looking at space we're looking at how well we read this text and we're just working as a class to kind of share our knowledge with each other okay ","i can stick around "
7316,120.4,Farrah,,"student you want to go first oh and student awesome student you go first for me okay ","okay so all right so my answer was basically that you need a scientific microscope to look really close and i was looking in paragraph three that's where i got my evidence because they talk about a microscope here "
7318,120.4,Farrah,,,"it's three three "
7325,120.4,Farrah,,"yes student go ahead and say it ","okay so actually i guess it was really about looking like discover it doesn't really say that it just says you need it to look really close "
7328,130.1,Oliver,,"right okay good so maybe the microscope isn't what we used to discover it ","no i was gonna say the same thing as student but i'm still kind of wondering why our answer is wrong like why the two of us is our answer is wrong i don't quite understand "
7331,120.4,Farrah,,"okay well so student just had a really good point student can you repeat that for student for me ","yeah so that basically like when you look at it the third paragraph like it doesn't say discovery to we're supposed to match up with what the question is asked it says you could look really closely but it does it match like the word discover "
7335,210.4,Chris,,"to find right so if we're looking to find something what are some of those words maybe in those first couple paragraphs 1 through 3 that go with finding something ","student find "
7337,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what do you say again can you say again ","yes i was going to say investigate "
7340,210.4,Oliver,,"student what do you think they used to investigate if you go back and look at the text ","well i guess i'm not sure if it's not the microscope might take me a moment "
7342,120.3,Oliver,,"that's okay look back through those first couple paragraphs ","i'm not sure "
7344,120.4,Chris,,"you're not sure okay we'll keep looking student what what can i help you with what do you think you know the answer ","well yeah i was gonna say i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and that's not in the reading but i know that they use you know "
7351,130.1,Jazmin,,"that's not entirely true but they did find water in some of those places ","lunar orbiter "
7356,420.2,Oliver,,"Instead of just agreeing with Farrah, maybe think about why do I agree with Farrah. What is it that she picked that I agree with. So you could still say I agree with Farrah, but then tell me that reason why you agree with her. Does that make sense. ","oh yeah i could tell you "
7359,410.2,Farrah,,"Okay, Farrah you learned and you saw that you were looking for a piece of machinery. You just picked the wrong one. Right. ","yeah i can see that unfortunately we have to go to lunch thank you so much "
7362,410.2,Luis,,,"um i just wanted to remind class that my dad is an astronaut that's pretty cool "
7367,420.3,Chris,,"so look back on your article and look for that word valuable do you see it anywhere in there maybe look for the word in one of the headings or sub headings ","oh yeah i saw it i's a subheading at the top it's water is a valuable resource "
7369,210.4,Chris,,"perfect alright so do you think that might be where we look for our answers class ","yeah "
7375,210.4,Jazmin,,"yep okay perfect so let's go down to that section ","you can say it's expensive "
7379,210.2,Luis,,"it's expensive okay so something that's expensive is considered valuable good okay ","i'm like something you can use or something that you need like valuable is you know like yeah like something that that you want "
7381,120.4,Farrah,,"Farrah, what is valuable mean to you. ","i was gonna say the same stuff "
7383,120.4,Farrah,,,"mostly the same stuff "
7386,110.1,Farrah,,"mostly the same stuff all right good ","yeah yeah actually yes it "
7388,210.4,Farrah,,"did what did it say valuable meant ","it says water on the moon valuable are very important resource "
7391,210.4,Farrah,,"let's underline very important ","no it's okay i was just gonna say yeah very important and then in the next line it says useful "
7402,210.4,Oliver,,"so make sure you're using the the text to look for answers too okay ","yeah we had a chance to look at and have the conversation "
7406,120.4,Chris,,"you did okay perfect alright so let's start with jazmin's class what are some of the things that it said make water a valuable resource from the moon student ","yeah okay so one thing is that water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and oxygen and it says that in the reading you said to look at the at the beauty and it says you could do that and that i think that would you really use "
7409,130.2,Jazmin,,"class can answer ","for example future astronauts could drink this water you can drink it and do other stuff right "
7413,210.4,Luis,,"astronauts could breathe the oxygen right so they could use the water to be broken down and to make oxygen so that's one way that the water is helpful or valuable right ","yeah yeah my dad would totally need that "
7420,130.2,Farrah,,"how about student and student show us another way that water could be useful and tell me the paragraph that you're in and start read the sentence that it comes from as well okay ","so unfortunately we have to go to our next class we go to our next class i just wanted to share with you how awesome it was to have you with us today and in particular you like really helped us to remember to use evidence in our reading and in our in our answers like so that didn't just say stuff without using evidence and like even more like you help us understand the meaning of words also they helped us to think about like how did we get to the answer so it was really cool because we were able to explain like what we were thinking about and i feel that you are really this student student just says stuff sometimes so we thank you so much it was really fun to work with you "
7422,130.2,Farrah,,,"bye "
7424,130.2,Farrah,,,"doing good it's good to see you "
7435,220.1,Jazmin,,"it's good to see you too um so i have seen your responses to our discussion question and i wanted to talk to you about how you came to know those answers yes student ","um yeah so like here's something that's kind of on my mind like i know like a lot about space and um i don't really think i need to be at this class you know Um, well, okay, so equipment and scientists and um water and moon yeah um student okay so basically and another word that i saw was discovered it's like when you find something or when you when you when you find something "
7438,230.2,Jazmin,,"good okay so you talked about nasa sending a small machine if we look back at the text what did it send the small machine to do ","okay so in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
7440,420.3,Jazmin,,"good so we could underline that sentence to support this discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right because investigate is something you do to discover something right ","right okay so i underlined it "
7446,230.1,Chris,,"or how did you come to that conclusion ","um so i kind of was like um let's see uh well is like in paragraph one i think no no no was it paragraph one yep scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um well i guess i'm not sure "
7448,210.4,Chris,,"so let's look back at the text so you've all read this once through right ","um well okay so there's a couple places on paragraph two they said on the lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and then paragraph paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
7450,230.1,Oliver,,"good okay now student you said you circled the same response as student can you explain what you mean by that ","um yeah so basically student and i both thought that that the microscope was the thing that they used to discover the water "
7454,230.1,Oliver,,"okay how would they be able to use a microscope to discover water in your opinion ","um um well they would use the microscope to look at it and it said that in the in the reading it said that the water they found is microscopic so it's like really small like you couldn't see it you had to look in the microscope um yeah i guess so "
7456,210.4,Farrah,,"so what tool in here does it say they use to find it ","oh oh oh so i just this really "
7462,110.1,Farrah,,"savanahh hold on let student finish but that's okay ","um well i guess i guess i'm not sure because like you have you have like the microscope but you would study it and then you have like student said the lunar orbiter and so you would use maybe both of them yeah so i was just going to ask like although i'm not sure now but it seemed like maybe the microscope wasn't the answer so i was just wondering why it was the lunar orbiter and not the microscope it's like finding something "
7468,420.2,Jazmin,,"and if you need help getting started you could say the equipment and the scientists used to discover water was the what and then write out your response ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just before we went to lunch i wanted to just thank you for working with us and especially i just wanted to thank you for you were really careful about making sure that like we all had a chance to speak and sometimes that doesn't happen in the class and so it was just really nice because we all had a chance to speak and we all had a chance to share our thoughts and also you were really patient even though we weren't like totally sure like what each piece was so i just wanted to thank you for doing that "
7471,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh it was delicious we had some noodles but then we had a chocolate chip cookie for desert that was mm mm mmmm "
7474,120.4,Luis,,"yes student did you have a question ","teacher yes yeah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
7479,230.1,Farrah,,"why do you think that ","okay well in the last paragraph it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so it sounds like that they don't have the money and it'll take a long time "
7482,230.1,Farrah,,"but if they could get to it and after a while with the water evaluable once they were able to get to it what do you think ","i mean all yeah cuz water it's definitely important so i guess if they could get to it it would be yeah "
7485,230.1,Jazmin,,"student you mentioned that that the astronauts would need water to drink and to stay hydrated right and why do you think that why is that true ","okay because well you know like we need water to drink um and i feel like i read it in my book i read it in the story where they talked about that they need water to drink "
7487,110.1,Jazmin,,"yeah so it's it's certainly mentioned that ","oh yeah yeah yeah i see it okay it's in the beginning it says future astronauts could drink this water "
7489,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah and so that would make it valuable right ","yeah yeah cuz you need to drink "
7493,230.1,Chris,,"why do you think it would be valuable if they can get water on the moon rather than taking it with them ","how could it be soluble if they could take water on the arm instead of waters okay so i said it was heavy oh well because okay so i know about when when the rockets take off that they they it's already heavy right because they have all this fuel and so then maybe you would burn less fuel if if it was less if they didn't have to carry as much water "
7496,230.3,Jazmin,,"very good so that's a very good observation on your part student and then if they didn't have to carry all the water with and they had room to carry other things whether that's fuel or other equipment or more people so that's very useful ","i was just thinking um you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
7501,120.4,Oliver,,"what else do you think would make water valuable student what are your thoughts on that ","well i had read the same thing that student was talking about in the last paragraph machine to you someone want ours to come up with a plan for extracting are getting out of the poor yeah i mean not i was like arm they need to study the moon's surface and sounds like it will be really hard because i need to study the moons surgace build new equipment i mean it's not valuable because it's too expensive "
7504,230.1,Oliver,,"say that we do have enough money and we do have enough time to get the water from the moon would then it be valuable ","i mean yeah cuz cuz you know water is valuable yeah okay water is valuable "
7506,120.4,Chris,,"ok so student what's another way that water could be valuable what's another thing they could use water for ","excuse me mr teacher i just thought about something from the story "
7508,120.4,Chris,,"okay student go ahead ","water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7510,130.2,Luis,,"very good that's a claim that student said right student ","yeah that's what i was gonna say that was that was the answer that i sent for the question "
7513,120.4,Luis,,"what are some things you can use oxygen for what do you think student ","to breathe "
7518,210.4,Luis,,"what do you see there that that hydrogen can be used for ","rocket fuel "
7520,110.1,Farrah,,"rocket fuel that's right ","rocket fuel "
7523,120.3,Farrah,,"it says rocket fuel ","i don't i don't see what you're seeing "
7525,120.3,Farrah,,"the part of the paragraph the article the second part where waters valuable resource it's paragraph number five starts off moon water can use one other ways ","okay yeah yeah oh i see that i see "
7530,210.4,Oliver,,"okay so i mean like rocket fuel and the moon i would that be by valuable ","well i was just gonna say i was looking at the clock out it's time for the next class um but i did want to say thank you so much mr teacher for helping us think about like what what we needed to find an ma ma ma ma ma story cuz i thought that you know i had read the story pretty well but then because you kept on asking us to think about it and to look at the story i i feel like i kind of maybe get it a little bit more baby "
7533,210.4,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
7536,210.4,Jazmin,,,"hi hello how are you "
7538,210.4,Jazmin,,,"we're doing well thank you "
7540,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah it's a question but it's well so here's the thing i know a lot about space so i don't think i really have to be in this class because i already know all this stuff "
7542,110.3,Luis,,"that's great that you know that stuff but what i'd like you to do you can help other students learn more to would you like to do that ","yeah that sounds like fun yeah "
7546,120.4,Farrah,,"student what do you think ","um so i think that the um the equipment was the microscope like in the reading it says you need a microscope you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7548,210.4,Farrah,,"okay and so when you look at that word let's look at that word again where it says that it says the water they found is microscopic and so do you think microscope and microscopic are the same thing ","um well it's like i think if it's microscopic like it's small and that's how like you see small stuff with like a microscope "
7552,210.4,Farrah,,"they were simply describing the size of the water as being microscopic that makes sense ","oh yeah that doesn't make sense so they didn't actually have a microscope on the moon "
7557,120.4,Chris,,"so student what do you think they used to determine the water was on the moon what did what did the reading tell you ","well so here's the thing like i kind of thought that like um well i've been to nasa with my dad and like we really like we had a really good time like walking around and like we saw all these like exhibits and stuff so i guess my guess is kind of like luis's like i think that they must have used like spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that "
7560,210.4,Jazmin,,"But if we look at the the information that was actually provided. Let's go back to that for just a minute and take a look at it where it talks about water on the moon. So everyone look look at it together. And the first statement that it says there. ","yeah so i was just wondering if like if the answer was what well i was just a little bit confused like why my answer might not be right "
7562,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i'm sorry it cut out for just a second i'm sorry "
7564,210.4,Jazmin,,,"so basically i was saying that um i was just wondering like why my answer maybe wasn't right like because i think we were just saying that the the the machine was gonna like see everything so i'm just trying to find out like like why my answer might not be right "
7567,210.4,Jazmin,,"see how it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate student what do you think a lunar orbiter would be ","it's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things "
7569,210.4,Jazmin,,"that's correct because if you look at the name lunar orbiter and look at what each of those words mean lunar refers to what do you know ","the moon "
7571,210.4,Jazmin,,"that's right lunar means something dealing with the moon and so what would an orbiter be what does orbit orbit mean ","orbit's like when something's like flying around something or like circling something so like like i guess like maybe like the spaceships like flying around the moon "
7579,210.4,Jazmin,,"for example student do you now understand with what microscopic means and they didn't have a microscope but they actually had a spaceship that orbited around the moon does that make sense ","yeah i think it does make sense that they like might study the water with a microscope but they they might find it with something else with the machine i "
7583,210.4,Jazmin,,"that's right that's very good and if they were able to get a sample of that water then they could certainly look at it with a microscope but in this case they haven't actually landed on the moon they're simply using the lunar orbiter to study the moon from a distance so so student ","i'm so sorry we have to go to lunch now but before we did i just wanted to thank you for working with us and specifically i wanted to thank you for being so patient sometimes we our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so thoughtful and very patient and also like even though our answers were kind of muddled at first like you helped us be very clear about what we were trying to say so thank you so much "
7586,210.4,Bennett,,,"okay let's bring up the student "
7590,150.1,Luis,,"together because i just want to go over a few of the things that we read in the article ","oh excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
7593,120.3,Chris,,"i've got your answers that you that you wrote down and so student could you read the first question that we were supposed to answer ","uh huh it says what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
7598,230.3,Chris,,"you didn't find where the water is located and you said it found craters with the water ","what equipment they used to find it i don't remember "
7601,130.2,Jazmin,,"well let me let me ask student a question student you mentioned that nasa sent a small machine what kind of machine did nasa send maybe you can help student with that one ","okay let me look i don't remember that's a small machine called a lunar orbiter that's the small machine it's the lunar orbiter student "
7603,210.4,Chris,,"exactly they sent a lunar orbiter have up there and so student do you know what a lunar orbiter is ","oh no i mean i've been a nasa and i saw the mars rover but i don't know what a lunar orbiter is "
7605,130.2,Luis,,"okay so student you know a lot about space can you tell us what the lunar orbiter is ","okay well so i know a lot about like what astronauts wear and what they use and i know that there isn't gravity but i actually never heard of a lunar orbiter before so this is news to me "
7610,210.4,Jazmin,,"and so that's why it's called a lunar orbiter lunar means moon and so lunar orbiter means something orbits around goes around the moon that makes sense ","but mr teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
7614,150.1,Jazmin,,"i'm just clarifying what kind of machine that they sent and the machine that they sent is called a lunar orbiter atoms okay does that make sense ","yeah yeah i thought we were all here because all of our answers are wrong "
7618,150.1,Jazmin,,"we just want to understand better exactly what you're trying to say and when you said a small machine we were able to clarify that that's the lunar orbiter we're going to get into more information that makes sense okay ","yeah yeah "
7622,120.4,Luis,,"any ideas about how they might detect water on from the orbiter ","hmm okay now that i've seen a picture of it um i think that let's see how would they detect the water um i feel like maybe maybe the camera just kind of look for it and if they see some puddles of water and then that's how they find it "
7625,230.1,Farrah,,"so student what what did you mention in terms of the ability to find the water you mentioned you would use a scientific tool called a microscope why would they need to use a microscope ","well what i mean cuz it said that in the story that was like the last sentence of the stories you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7630,210.4,Chris,,"certainly if you saw a water puddle you know that was water on the moon the water is much smaller so it's very hard to see in fact if you had a sample from there you wouldn't be able to see it without a microscope yes yes ","i was just gonna say since we're talking about the scientific tools that um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits that stuff "
7636,120.4,Farrah,,"student go ahead what do you think student go ahead ","well i was just i was thinking that you know if i'm if if if the astronauts got like you know thirsty or something then they could just like drill a hole in the moon maybe and then they could drink the water like that maybe "
7639,120.4,Oliver,,"so student what do you have ","well i was just looking at the clock and i i see about it's time for us to go to lunch so i just wanted to let you know before we call "
7642,120.4,All,,,"hi "
7647,150.1,Luis,,"and so i just wanted to kind of get your input and let you class share with me your responses on the question ","excuse me a teacher i hadn't been on this class i already know all about space "
7650,110.3,Farrah,,"right student so you'll be able to share some information with us and maybe you can learn from your friends to okay ","off okay okay student and so do you mind to share with us what your response was "
7652,110.3,Farrah,,,"sure i sit on that scientists could use the microscope to find the water "
7655,130.2,,,"that's great so do you class think that you can use a microscope to find water on the moon ","i have a same thing "
7659,210.4,Oliver,,"okay student or sabina what do you class use a microscope for ","us to look at small stuff that's right so um have you used a microscope in your other science classes yeah yeah well you're stomping mr smith's clash "
7664,130.1,All,,"what tool they this the scientists used so you can use a microscope ","um "
7666,130.1,,,,"yeah "
7668,120.3,Chris,,"teacher student can we go to paragraph two ","yeah "
7670,120.3,Chris,,"very first in its ","nasa send a small machine on the lunar orbiter to investigate "
7673,120.1,Farrah,,"oh so oliveron student what was the tool that they used on the moon ","and lunar orbiter "
7677,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense to you all ","um well i guess i didn't know because you had student read it "
7684,130.2,Jazmin,,"student what did the scientists fine ","i don't understand what why is my answer wrong "
7686,120.4,Jazmin,,"so student what did what did you say ","i said that i used to small machine "
7689,210.4,Jazmin,,"and you're right so they did use a small machine do you know what the name of that machine was ","i think it was the one you had student read a lunar orbiter "
7692,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you know they were trying to find ","ice deposits "
7697,150.1,Jazmin,,"Does that make sense. ","i think so "
7700,120.3,Luis,,"student can you read the second sentence and paragraph two ","i'm sure okay this loan or what oh well land damone south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
7702,210.4,Jazmin,,"good job so what did the lunar orbiter do student ","look for ice deposits "
7706,210.4,Jazmin,,"so i'll read this in it for said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in about 32 ounces of water ","water "
7709,210.4,Chris,,"water so by using the lunar orbiter to decide to investigate the ice deposits those ice deposit sores what was holding the water ","um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
7711,110.3,Luis,,"your right and so student said the same thing right student what was something that you said that scientists use ","i said oxygen tanks too and spacesuit "
7715,110.2,Chris,,"right so they those are different types of equipment that scientists use so you class are right and that they use oxygen tanks and space suits do do those equipment does that equipment help them discover water ","um well i guess i guess not i mean it and helps them breathe on on the mon "
7719,210.3,Luis,,"right so what does the oxygen tank do student ","and helps them breathe Lunar Orbiter. "
7723,230.1,Oliver,,"so what made you think that that was the type of equipment that they used ","i'm teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch thanks for taking my time to work with us "
7730,120.2,Farrah,,"we're gonna follow up with the question of is there convincing evidence that water on the name could be valuable ","oh it means that like you got to say it so that i believe you "
7735,210.2,Oliver,,"what does convincing mean ","convince me that you gotta know more than me "
7737,230.3,Oliver,,"so there has to be more knowledge they have to provide more knowledge than what you have ","yeah yeah "
7739,210.2,Chris,,"okay student what does convincing mean ","if if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it and they like the try to get you to do with a big that's convincing "
7741,230.3,Jazmin,,"okay so they're making statements to make you believe something ","well i guess like when i am trying to advocate for our environment and i go out and i i pass out leaflets to try to tell people what they can do i try to convince them "
7745,210.2,Luis,,"student what is convincing for you ","i'm well i convince class that i'm like i'm the best at minecraft ever i just want to remind you all saw that my dad is actually an astronaut "
7748,140.1,Luis,,"how do you convince people that you're the best at minecraft what do you say ","i beat them and i say ah you can't do it as well as me and then i play the game and i get the most points and and i say you're a loser "
7750,140.1,Luis,,"well you actually show them by beating them in the game right so you're using actions instead of words to convince them ","yeah "
7753,120.4,Jazmin,,"that water on the moon could be valuable it can be of use for the astronauts so student you stated that there was not convincing evidence is that correct ","well i just i mean i do think there's convincing evidence because like they could drink the water and they could stay hydrated and you need water so that seems to be convincing the have water "
7757,210.3,Jazmin,,"astronauts could do what with the water ","we can drink it "
7761,230.1,Oliver,,"right right student and you say that there wasn't enough convincing evidence what makes you believe that there's not enough convincing evidence ","um well i i know that um i know that the mo0ns not ready to live on so i don't think that i'm convinced that arm but we could we could get water from there because we can't live there "
7764,210.4,Oliver,,"what else what else do we mean student besides water ","air "
7768,210.3,Oliver,,"but if there was water on the moon but that help us ","yeah because then you can like take a bath on your card arm drink it like like what "
7772,110.4,Chris,,"student you did a good job for answering and you say to that water can be valuable because it's so heavy and then astronauts wouldn't have to carry it anymore correct ","i have yeah "
7774,120.4,Jazmin,,"and then student what did you say astronauts could do ","i said they could drink it "
7778,210.4,Chris,,"they can drink it can we survive without water ","what else must miss paul i also saw in this mo story that i'm water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7780,110.2,Luis,,"you're right you did a great job with with understanding what water is even how can it be valuable for us on the moon ","because we can while we can drink it and we can take a bath and i'm "
7782,110.2,Luis,,,"okay "
7786,110.2,Oliver,,"yeah we can use it to drink we can use it to bake those are great job class thank you ","hi it's good to see you hi "
7790,220.1,Luis,,"so i wanted to go over the discussion question that you all answer yes student ","um yeah so i had kind of this question like i already know like all about space i know all this stuff so i was kind of wondering like i don't think i should be in this class "
7793,110.3,Luis,,"okay well i'm so glad that you know a lot about space ","okay um the discussion question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
7795,120.4,Luis,,"teacher alright student so without looking at the text do you know the answer to that question ","um well i think that they use like oxygen tanks and that they use like space suits and stuff like that "
7797,210.1,Luis,,"okay they do use that in space but i think the question is asking what did they use to discover water so do you know what specific tool they use to discover water ","oh i didn't really read that closely because i thought i kind of knew this stuff "
7799,420.3,Luis,,"okay so how about we go back in the text and look a little bit more closely so that we can learn more information about space okay ","okay "
7801,120.4,Farrah,,"all right student and what was your answer to the discussion question ","so my answer was that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
7804,230.2,Farrah,,"and but let's can you find that in the text is there any way you can go back in the text and see where you found that ","yeah absolutely um okay so in paragraph paragraph three "
7806,230.2,Farrah,,,"you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely after it talks about the water "
7809,120.4,Chris,,"student ","yeah okay so i think like discover is like how you you find something or you kind of like um like you you like find something "
7815,150.1,Farrah,,"okay does that make sense ","yeah i think so so like my answer wasn't quite right but it was like that they they have to use something else to discover the water "
7819,120.4,Jazmin,,"alright student you kind of want to explain your answer for us ","sure so basically what i said was that that nasa used a small machine and that's like the machine that they sent to the moon "
7823,130.2,Chris,,"okay yeah and so what did that small machine do student can you look in paragraph two and tell us what this small machine did ","yeah okay so small machine um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
7826,230.2,Luis,,"and what does that lunar orbiter do ","um so like the lunar orbiter i guess like okay so it flies around the moon and maybe it lands on the moon and and it might do things like "
7830,130.2,Chris,,"okay so student can you help him out and tell us what the lunar orbiter does ","Yeah, so I could do that. But I like first. I just wanted to ask, like, um, i went to nasa so like with my dad and we saw that like the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so like i guess i'm a little confused like is student wrong or like i'm not quite sure "
7833,210.4,Chris,,"so my question was can you tell us what the lunar orbiter does so i want you to read the second sentence in paragraph two ","the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for the ice deposits and a large pool crater "
7838,120.4,Jazmin,,"what is it student ","so they used the lunar orbiter to investigate "
7841,120.4,Farrah,,"student what did they discover ","they found lots of um well they found water they found amounts of water "
7848,120.4,Jazmin,,"student ","so they used the lunar orbiter to discover water and so we have to go in just a moment but before we went i just wanted to thank you for teaching the class and i especially wanted to thank you for like really spending time with us too and being really patient with our different answers like sometimes we give our science teacher he says we gave him stress hives and i'm really really patient and also like i think that you really helped us to like work as a class to something like don't get along and you really helped us to work strongly as a class so thank you so much "
7854,130.1,Luis,,"those are all tools that scientists use but just make sure you're reading the question of what specific equipment did they used to discover water on the moon okay ","yeah so here's the thing um i don't really need to be in this class because i know all about space so i don't think i really need to be here "
7856,150.1,Luis,,"well perhaps you can help us all learn more about space as we continue going forward in a class ","okay yeah i can do that "
7859,150.1,Farrah,,,"so we were just talking about our answers to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you can ask us anything you like "
7862,230.3,Farrah,,"student you believe that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely when you are trying to look at water on the moon ","right "
7868,130.2,Chris,,"yes does class else have another aspect what they may have also sent with the astronauts ","i think that what they must have sent was um like oxygen tanks and masks and like suits and stuff like that because um they they have to like breathe in space like my dad took me to nasa and we saw like that they had to use all this equipment and everything so like they had to use it if they were going to space "
7876,120.1,Oliver,,"does class have an idea ","yeah so basically um i think i had the same answer is student and we thought that it was the microscope that they had to send to basically like look at the water and see the water so um i guess what i'm trying to understand is like did is like um why my answer is wrong like efforts because we're all working together to get a better answer like maybe why is my answer wrong "
7882,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","um yeah um so they it was the they sent like a microscope and something else "
7887,120.1,Jazmin,,"perhaps um does it talk about anything else within the paragraphs ","um let's see i guess um well they talk about so i think they sent a small machine "
7890,130.3,Jazmin,,"okay yes within the second paragraph it talks about nasa would send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","so is that just what i was missing was just the name of it "
7892,110.2,Jazmin,,"i mean it is a small machine it you're you're still correct ","so yeah i think it was a small machine the lunar orbiter is what they sent because it was sent up and then they would like fly around the moon and then i guess it lands on the moon and then it would discover the water i think "
7897,150.1,Jazmin,,"does class does class have any questions ","i just want to thank you we have to go to lunch now but i just take the moment you for working with us and for being so positive i think sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were very patient with us and you really took the time to listen to our answers and i just wanted to thank you for that "
7902,150.1,Luis,,,"hi yeah okay so basically what i was gonna say is that um you know i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
7905,150.1,Luis,,"and that may be the case student but it is always best to you know sort of definitely challenge our preconceptions of of science and how we can further our learning ","yeah i could do that "
7913,120.4,Jazmin,,"i would like to at least in the beginning let's let's let student and chrise let us know what they got for the first question ","okay um so for me i said that scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon to me i say that nasa sent a small machine okay i was kind of curious like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong "
7918,120.2,Jazmin,,"where did you get the question is what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon ","it says that the small machine this machine is the lunar orbiter "
7920,150.1,Jazmin,,"ok so the lunar orbiter good job so for the most part that so that is the small machine the exact same thing is the lunar orbiter ","it says in the reading that you need nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so the lunar orbiter must be this small machine "
7927,130.1,Chris,,"and student you are you are you know you were correct to you you're able to find out where they were able to find the water ","Well, okay. So I went to nasa with my dad and when we went there I saw that scientists, a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like I i was thinking maybe that was something that that you know what I mean, that's the tools that they're using "
7932,420.3,Chris,,"but if you were to look through the sort of the article a little bit more you know sort of try to pick out some keywords ","that's a good question i guess you might need other equipment yeah you couldn't just like use the suit and be like oh yeah here here's like the water you can use other stuff that's a great question "
7935,420.3,Farrah,,,"unfortunately we have to go on to our next class but we wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
7938,420.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut which is pretty cool "
7940,140.1,Luis,,"do you know the name of the facility that your dad works at ","i yeah he works at that that's dennis space center i'm in mississippi and he kind of like commute so we don't get to see him as often as you know we like "
7942,140.1,Luis,,"well that's that's unfortunate but does he uh are you able to speak to him on a regular basis perhaps or some online activity or is hearing stories ","yeah yeah we talk on skype all the time "
7944,110.3,Luis,,"well that's that's that's really cool you know sort of idea that you have that sort of special inroads you know you're a you know first hand knowledge of some of this might actually come you know sort of in handy and help somebody goes to kind of understand this material ","awesome "
7948,120.4,Oliver,,"and student what was your answer to that question ","um ok so my answer was no you know i'm because i don't think it's ready yet "
7953,210.3,Oliver,,"but let's say for example the do you need do you need water to live on earth ","oh yeah you're totally need it and like i i could see that like maybe it would be maybe valuable but i don't think it's like that convincing the evidence because it seems like it would cost a lot of money and take a lot of time to like we don't even really have spaceship that go to the moon very often "
7957,210.3,Jazmin,,"but if one day we are able to you know perhaps expand our you know space traveling capabilities to be able to actually use the water on the moon might be a little bit more inexpensive inexpensive than actually having to transport it to me ","and will and i was thinking like what you could do with all the water is like grow a garden all over the moon like you could make this moon garden "
7961,110.2,Jazmin,,"but it would definitely you know perhaps provide sort of you know sort of some greenhouses that we might be able to construct on the moon so that perhaps the scientists could even perhaps grow vegetables and have something to that that they can grow to eat on the moon ","yeah that's really cool "
7965,210.3,Farrah,,"this can class does he might know of another reason that it might actually sort of be beneficial to have water on the moon they might actually help out astronauts ","actually i was asking because i my opinion is that it's actually not very convincing evidence that kind of agree with with student so i don't know if you wanted someone who thought it was convincing is because i kind of think it's like not but i think that it will be valuable but not for a long time "
7967,230.3,Farrah,,"yes yes it's so you are correct currently like like you said as for right now is you know not very valuable just because we don't really have class there but ","yeah "
7969,210.3,Farrah,,"but do you think perhaps like you said perhaps in the future is there enough evidence you know you know at least going forward if it were to have some type of you know human habitation there on the surface of the moon with the water become more valuable than for those who live there ","oh yeah i think in like sure it could be very valued it just seems like people you know like it would be hard to build it and yeah i i could see and i just think it will be valuable you know long time "
7971,110.1,Luis,,"fair enough yes student ","um yeah so actually um so what i was thinking is that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know stuff like that um and then also like you know water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
7977,210.4,Chris,,"and perhaps hydrogen can be used for rocket fuel for maybe traveling back to earth from the moon ","yeah i was just gonna say that so water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and we like you know that in the reading it says that "
7986,210.4,Luis,,"and that would provide ample reasoning for us to be able to use that water even if it is barely sparsely spread out to enhance those astronauts and scientists labs there on the moon ","um so we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and so like in particular i really wanted to thank you for asking me so much about my dad and it was really fun to talk in this class and share with class about like some of my life and and it was really cool like you helped us to understand like that we needed to evidence from the text step we were eating and that that was really important and you really asked us to explain ideas like why we thought that something was you know valuable or not valuable and like student and deb have different ideas then like student and i and you really i'm like listen to our opinions so i i feel like really good about class and i'm really excited to like learn some more from you so thank you so much "
7989,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah i just was i just wanted to say i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all there is to know about space "
7993,120.3,Jazmin,,"student can i get you to read the question ","reach every reader okay the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8001,420.1,Oliver,,"so what i want you to do for just a couple minutes look back at that question and i want you to take your pencil and circle or highlight some important words that you feel that are important to you or something that stands out to you ","i think we're good "
8005,420.1,Oliver,,,"um in the question or in the whole text Yeah. Um, okay. So what are the things that I circled in the question was basically you know I circled equipment and I'm water. "
8007,230.1,Oliver,,"equipment water okay why did you circle equipment ","um i circled equipment because they're asking in the question they're saying what equipment did the scientists used to discover the water so it seems like the answer would have to be some kind of equipment "
8013,310.1,Farrah,,"very good job looking deep into your question and circling the keywords ","yes so what i did was i said equipment and discover "
8015,230.1,Farrah,,"discover all right and why did you circle discover ","discover because they were asking like you know what i mean like what they found the water like discovers like something that you like found the first time and asking like what equipment found the water "
8019,150.1,Farrah,,"and student the same thing discovers like a verb we're looking deep into it and you're trying to find out what they discovered ","i just i just was wondering like i didn't i wasn't quite sure why my answer was wrong "
8022,130.1,Farrah,,"it's not that it was the wrong answer it could have been a better choice and we're going to get talk about more about that when we're talking just like you brought up discover before when you look at the question did you look at discover ","i'm i'm mostly focused well i guess yeah i thought about discover just like student i circled equipment and water "
8027,140.1,Chris,,"now we're not scientist and we're not astronauts and there's some things that we do know but right now you every one of your student at school right so what's an equipment you have right now thats helping you with your work student ","oh oh well that's a good question but i was gonna say first just real quick because i went to nasa i know that scientists use like lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i saw that they weren't in the in the reading but if your question about like what do we like we use tablets and we use pencils and paper "
8035,120.2,Jazmin,,"and we talked about equipment we have like you said the tablets and pencils but what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","in the in the question "
8037,120.2,Jazmin,,,"i circled equipment and discover "
8040,150.1,Jazmin,,"when you're looking at a question you will get where they're asking for and that's key points every one of you said equipment and they discovered and then a lot yes event student sorry ","it's time for the next class so thank you so much for working with us "
8042,150.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut "
8049,120.3,Oliver,,"all right can i get student to read the question for us please ","sure okay so it says um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon would be valuable "
8054,420.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what we're going to do right now we're going to use the same strategy that we've been taught before about how important it is to make these connections and find out what the question's asking and help us to go back to the text so first what i want you to do is get your pencil or highlighter and look back over and find an important word or words that you feel you don't understand okay ","i think i know the word but i just wanted to check evidence what does it mean "
8059,210.2,Farrah,,"What do you think evidence would be, what do you think evidence would be Farrah. ","evidence is like in detective stories like it's like how they proove something so it's like proof "
8062,210.2,Jazmin,,"and we're going to discover evidence and proof very good alright so student she's exactly right like we're looking for proof but proof of what exactly ","we're looking to see if the if the like okay so is there like good proof i guess they're like strong like convincing proof that the water it's valuable and i think it is and i think you could even grow a garden on the moon "
8065,230.1,Jazmin,,"oh so what makes you think you could grow a garden on the moon ","because they talk about the water and they said like the astronauts could be able to drink the water eventually and and be hydrated and you can't survive without water water to grow plants "
8067,110.2,Jazmin,,"great and that's a good connection so i loved your response about the word you used use the word hydrate did you use hydrate student you said it again ","you can stay hydrated "
8070,230.3,Jazmin,,"did you tell me that our plants need water to survive is that correct ","yes so if there was water you could make a garden you could grow it using the water "
8073,310.1,Chris,,"i love that so you went back into the text when you said you didn't understand that word ","Oh yeah, it was mostly the same word evidence. And I was thinking that, like, basically. Well, I think the evidence is good because water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen plus water so heavy. They don't have to carry it in ships anymore. "
8076,110.2,Chris,,"i thought that was a great idea to be you look at that i'm glad you looked at that detail about hearing the shoes because it's heavy ","oh well cuz okay so i actually knew already because um well i guess they said it in the reading but they but like i knew that because i visited nasa and i know all about nasa and i could tell you that water is like one of the heaviest things they have to carry on a spaceship "
8079,110.1,Luis,,"all right so great connections i love this ","yeah yeah true very true very good "
8084,120.2,Farrah,,"okay so we're looking at again is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable yes student ","i'm so i'm so sorry but unfortunately we do have to go to watch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for that in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us use evidence from the text in our answers and you also helped us declare hi hi "
8087,120.2,Farrah,,,"we're doing well thank you how are you "
8091,140.1,Luis,,"so did you enjoy reading the passage ","you know i think we did um yeah i enjoyed it but i just have a question i don't really think that i should be in this class because i already know like all about space "
8093,230.1,Luis,,"what is it you know about space ","oh man i know all this stuff like rocket launches and like equipment and like all this stuff that like people would would use to go into space and like you know what i mean like all kinds of stuff "
8098,110.3,Farrah,,"that's great student you know what you gave me a great idea i want each one of you to get a little piece of paper ","we can work super fast okay so we actually just finished "
8103,120.4,Farrah,,"student what's something that you learn new from your partners ","so pearson was talking about how he went to nasa and he like got to go and visit with his dad and so he was talking about how like in like rocket launches how like the like um like it looks like smoke but it's actually steam comes out of the rocket when it flies up which is pretty cool "
8107,110.2,Farrah,,"great and there's a lot dealing with article because that's like equipment right like you read about equipment in the passage that we had ","i was wondering can i ask you a quick question "
8110,110.2,Farrah,,,"um so i just wanted to ask you um so it seems like my answers like not quite correct what i said about like the microscope i'm just trying to understand why "
8112,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so your answer was will you refresh my memory and tell me what your answer was ","sure my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8118,120.3,Oliver,,"alright student read that the number one ","um yeah i can read it okay so um let's see our scientists have known for a long time that the moon is a desert are we reading paragraph one "
8121,120.3,Oliver,,,"you're right that was a different page sorry yeah you're right scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
8125,120.3,Chris,,"okay let's let student will you read number two ","um yeah okay so um so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
8130,120.4,Luis,,"yes student ","okay so i think that they probably had to use stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits and and like stuff like that you know "
8133,120.4,Jazmin,,"student ","i think they use the small machine machine and it's called a lunar orbiter i think that's what they used to discover the water "
8138,120.3,Jazmin,,"alright student can i get you to read number three ","sure okay number three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8140,120.4,Farrah,,"okay and student isn't that what you mentioned you'd need a scientific tool called a what ","a microscope "
8142,230.2,Farrah,,"mm hmm and why we use that for to look at what to look at things ","to look closely like to see something close "
8144,140.1,Farrah,,"okay what's something that we use today or you've ever used if we want to look at something very close it's really small what's something that we could use ","um like different than a microscope "
8146,140.1,Farrah,,,"um the like a magnifying glass "
8150,140.1,Chris,,"all right so student where did you see a microscope at ","um so i saw a microscope like in science class um like i've seen it in a couple places but i think we've all seen it in science class and also we've like you know we've seen it in movies and stuff like that "
8154,120.4,Farrah,,"okay all right student ","um yeah so i just unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we went to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially wanted to thank you for really asking us like to think about what we already know about space and like how that like really gets us excited to like work together and talk about it with each other and sometimes our science teacher says we give him stress hives and you were so patient and very very very thoughtful and how you asked us questions i just wanted to thank you "
8156,120.4,Farrah,,,"thank you "
8159,120.4,Oliver,,,"yeah we can you yeah we can hear you hello "
8162,120.4,Farrah,,"student i it seems like you and student here we're kind of on the same path student can you read your response for me please ","i'm sure i can i think student has his hand raised "
8164,120.4,Luis,,,"oh no problem i just um i don't think i should be in this class because i already know like all about space so i don't really have like a lot more to cover "
8166,140.1,Luis,,"oh you already know a lot about space good what do you want me to tell me about space student ","um well there's like i know all about like rocket launches and i know about like you have to where spacesuits and oxygen tanks and like you know like i know that like space is a vacuum like all that kind of stuff "
8168,110.3,Luis,,"okay so you do have some some of a good foundation on space so when we cover more about space it seems like you'll be able to help some of your classmates right ","yeah that sounds pretty good "
8170,110.3,Luis,,"okay so maybe maybe we go forward maybe i'll have you been one of our class leaders okay ","all right "
8173,230.1,Farrah,,"okay so that sounds good thank you student but let's let's go back to our question about the equipment used on the moon so let's go back and look at our responses here now i did notice student and student had the same response so which one of you would like to explain your response ","yes so basically i said that um that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess what i mean is that like in paragraph three it talks about how you have to be able to use the microscope to even see the water "
8175,230.2,Oliver,,"okay and so that's very good student and student is that where you found your evidence as well ","um yeah so i pretty much have the same place and the same idea um i think adding to farrahs answer like i think that you have to use the microscope to see it you can't like find it i guess unless you can see it "
8179,130.1,Oliver,,"so you both are on the right track here in the equipment they're using a microscope to see the water ","Um, yeah. So should I go back and read? "
8183,120.4,Jazmin,,"and then while you're doing that can i hear from some of the people that haven't talked about what about student or student and when you tell me what what you read ","basically what i learned was that that they sent a small machine up to the moon "
8185,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay they sent a small machine and where did you see that at ","it's in paragraph two and actually i have a question about that so i knew that we're all working together to try to improve our answers and i'm wondering like what might be wrong about my answer "
8188,210.3,Jazmin,,"so you how do you think if we took your answer they send a small machine which your correctly did what else how could we make that a little more clear for somebody if they had no idea what you're talking about ","like if we could say what the machine is that's like being used "
8190,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay so we could say what machine is and what what was the machine here that was being used ","machine was the lunar orbiter "
8192,110.4,Chris,,"ok so the machine was the lunar orbiter so why don't you go ahead and circle that and then i'm going to come back to you in just a moment let me hear from student student what were you gonna say ","okay so basically i was gonna say kind of like i guess kind of like what student said before like i went to nasa with my dad and like i know that scientists have to use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits and all that kind of stuff so like i guess i'm wondering like is that i guess that's not the answer but didn't they have to use that stuff to find the water "
8196,110.3,Chris,,"so i think that means you probably have a lot you could share with the rest of the class about some of your experience with nasa and maybe we could talk about that here in a little bit and you could tell us some more interesting facts ","okay yeah that sounds great "
8198,110.3,Luis,,"okay so maybe you and student could be our two leaders when it comes to some of the having a little more knowledge about space okay ","yeah awesome "
8200,110.3,Oliver,,,"on yeah we get that we checked and kind of read through everything "
8202,110.3,Farrah,,,"yeah "
8205,120.4,Farrah,,"okay and what what did you find what what do you like to share together as a class ","well i guess we were listening to as you were saying this stuff with with student so i guess the the difference is like what's the best answer and like i guess you like you said you have to you have to find the water before you can use the microscope to see the water so they couldn't have used the microscope to discover the water unless they unless they knew it was there "
8208,130.2,Oliver,,"okay so and student did you agree with student ","um yeah no i agree and i think that makes sense to me "
8213,420.1,Jazmin,,"by throwing in a little something that could be the answer but you got to be clever and make sure you watch out and make sure you're looking for what could be the best answer you can give now student what's your question ","so actually we have to go to lunch here in just a moment but i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you so much for really having us work with each other and having a sort of think through our answers ourselves sometimes our science teacher says that we give him stress hives and you were so patient with us and also sometimes we don't necessarily get along as a class but you really encourage us to like work with each other and listen to each other's answers and then come to like a better answer ourselves so it just to thank you for doing that "
8215,420.1,Jazmin,,,"reach every reader sounds good okay "
8219,420.1,Luis,,,"um well it's actually more like a comment i i already know all about space so i don't think i have to be in this class "
8221,230.1,Luis,,"okay so i student so you think are you know a lot about space so what makes you think that you wouldn't want to be part of this class though ","well cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer um so you wanted to talk to us so i feel like i kind of know everything "
8223,110.3,Luis,,"if you think you have a you know if you know a lot about space don't you think that would make it even better for you to be in this class to help the rest of us and maybe we could learn from each other ","that's a good point okay i'll stick around "
8226,120.4,Farrah,,"so that sounds very good so would class like to open up with what they thought as far as their response to the first discussion question ","okay so basically my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
8230,120.1,Farrah,,"Do you think if we went back to the text, could we find anything else that scientists might have used when they were discovering wonder on the moon? Any other equipment. ","yeah because we could okay so we should look for i should look for more equipment "
8232,420.2,Farrah,,"i think if we go back into the text and we look for any mention of equipment that scientists have used and we underline that that we could then build on your answer we'd have a complete full answer to that question ","okay i'll take a look "
8235,420.2,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so basically what i was thinking is like that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
8238,120.3,Chris,,"teacher and then also i would like you we need to relook at the question and we need to reevaluate that question so can you read back the question for me ","yeah okay what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
8243,420.1,Chris,,"It might be great to build our knowledge and answer questions that might not even be asked but when it comes to being a successful student, especially on any other tests that you might have from other teachers. We want to make sure that we're looking at the question that's being asked and that we're addressing just that in our response. Does that make sense. ","so yeah so like the equipment not the not about so what should be the answer right "
8245,420.2,Chris,,"usually it's best when we answer a question if we just stick to that question and we can save the extra information for discussions like when we're having right now ","cool okay "
8249,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay so thank thank you very much student for sharing so thank you thank you for contributing ","i said that nasa sent a small machine and but i was wondering like why my answer was wrong because it seems like the right answer "
8252,420.2,Jazmin,,"how do you think we could be a little bit more specific in our response because there are lots of small machines in the world right ","yeah "
8255,420.2,Jazmin,,"if we go back into the text we can see the type of small machine that they sent and so we can give that a name so that when we respond to the question we're being specific with our answer ","I think I know I think I was just, I know what this machine was so is the answer. The Lunar Orbiter. "
8258,210.4,Jazmin,,"and then do you remember from the text what the lunar orbiter what it was doing ","when i looked at it i sadi it investigated because it's small machine that's what discovered it because it was investigating "
8262,510.1,Chris,,"you built off your answer i appreciate how you build your answer we got more specific we narrowed down to that core of knowledge we're looking for and then we said okay this is this is what that machine was and this is what it was doing ","yeah i just i did check on the the text and what i saw was you know when i was looking at it i guess i was wondering like but i've been the nasa so i know that like your scientists and astronauts use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits i guess i was wondering like why that's not the answer "
8267,210.1,Chris,,"to address student question i would just like to clarify so when we talk about nasa here were first of all two things you know we're talking specifically about the scientists here so not just not just astronauts that might be actually exploring space physically but also the scientist on the ground ","Yeah okay so what equipment that scientists use to discover, oh! what equipment is scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8270,210.2,Chris,,"so we're looking for specific equipment and equipment is doing what harrion ","that equipment is discovering the water on the moon "
8279,110.4,Farrah,,"exactly it's discovering water on the moon ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i circled the same thing as student scientists found craters full of water on the moon nasa sent a small machine scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and all kinds of other stuff hi how are you doing today "
8282,110.4,Luis,,,"we're doing well we're trying to figure out the answer to this question yeah and i i have a question i'm just wondering i already know all about space like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't need any help with anything "
8284,220.1,Luis,,"so the reason why we're looking back over your answers and i want to have help you have a better understanding of space and exactly why there is water on the moon ","okay well that sounds okay i guess i can hang around for that "
8291,210.4,Jazmin,,"when we look back over the text in paragraph two um what what did it say we're looking for what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um i can answer well basically in paragraph two it says nasa send to small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
8293,210.4,Jazmin,,,"do you want me to read anymore "
8297,230.2,Jazmin,,"that's one type of equipment what else did they do with the equipment what did it do ","well they used it to like go and look for ice deposits in the polar craters and that's where they found them "
8300,110.1,Farrah,,"good job student ","yes so i was kind of wondering like why my answer is is really right or my it might be wrong i don't really understand "
8302,110.2,Farrah,,"so your your answer is not wrong i'm in paragraph three it talks about that the water they found us microscopic meaning that you wouldn't be able to see it so i think that's where you were thinking that you would need a tool walk a microscope to see those types of things on the moon does that help you understand more ","i think so like do i need to i need them they need the microscope to see the water or can they see it in another way "
8304,120.3,Farrah,,"they they use the small machine the lunar orbiter to investigate ","okay "
8308,120.3,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so like basically i think luis's thing about like well like he said before like um scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like i i've been to nasa with my dad and like it was definitely um they had like all that equipment they have like the shuttle they had the boots and like the oxygen tanks and all this stuff like um do you think that like i guess i'm wondering like why that might not be right "
8310,150.1,Chris,,"why it might not be right for what we're talking about right now ","yeah like why that's not like the answer "
8312,130.1,Chris,,"so you are correct nasa does use all types of equipment that these boots they have special special articles of clothing that they were but some some things like the the oxygen tanks those on they use for different things so those things they might use like when they're exploring space around space missions but for this they're talking about a machine that they use to find out about to find out about the ice deposits ","okay that makes sense "
8315,130.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so actually we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today it was really nice to meet you and it was also really nice like you're very patient with each of us and you really listen to what we had to say and really like made us feel like we were being heard when you are talking to us so we really appreciate it thank you so much "
8319,130.1,Luis,,,"i'm good i'm good i'm scares me i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
8322,150.1,Luis,,"some ideas with us about the article ","okay "
8331,120.2,Luis,,"okay so our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um it's asking what equipment do they use to discover water on the moon "
8333,210.2,Farrah,,"okay that's the question and so does class here know what the word equipment means ","okay oh yeah because we will use equipment in pe class "
8335,130.2,Jazmin,,"okay that's one type of equipment class else know about another type of equipment ","we also use it in science class to "
8338,210.2,Chris,,"correct those are all types of equipment and so what about the word discover do we all know what the word discover means ","i think discover is like when you find something "
8348,210.4,Farrah,,"different objects and then there's the word microscopic and microscopic just means that it's something that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking right at it yes so student ","i use the microscope and my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong so no one's answer is wrong it's just that some answers are "
8351,210.3,Oliver,,"that we need to expand upon some of the answers ","well i was gonna say about the microscope and i'm so when i thought i thought was the right answer because they talk about the microscope and the water in that paragraph "
8354,210.4,Oliver,,"the ice it's a form of the microscopic ice ","okay "
8361,120.3,Jazmin,,"and then in paragraph three it says that means the moon is still drier than the dress desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","okay well i got my answer from paragraph to i don't know what's wrong with mine "
8368,420.2,Jazmin,,"and give more details what top of small machine was it ","i'm looking "
8370,420.2,Chris,,,"you know what a teacher i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
8372,140.1,Chris,,"you are correct i went to nasa as well when i was younger two different times and they use all kinds of really cool equipment ","yeah it's really cool there i had a great time with my dad "
8374,140.1,Jazmin,,"i had a great time there as well ","ok i see it says that nasa scientists small machine called a lunar orbiter "
8378,110.4,Jazmin,,"excellent so nasa see the machine and it's called a winner orbiter ","investigated "
8381,210.4,Luis,,"so we know the lunar orbiter investigated what did it investigate ","i'm all right there says and i was looking for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
8383,110.4,Luis,,"okay so it looked for ice deposits in a large ","crater "
8388,210.4,Oliver,,"what details that it gave about they asked deposits ","oh it set of eyes deposits were really small "
8394,210.4,Oliver,,"investigate and they found asked deposits that were really small ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch well "
8396,210.4,Oliver,,,"i was just gonna say thanks for taking my time to work with us and we'll have to see you next time "
8399,210.4,All,,,"okay bye "
8405,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm good okay i think i got this all figured out so i got it i understand now "
8410,120.4,Luis,,"so anything would you like to share ","yeah yeah okay so um we were reading that up first the sentence in a second paragraph and so now i think the answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposit "
8420,110.1,Luis,,"faster gate to investigate ","asked about because that's what it says on a story okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbit to investigate and then i added ice deposits from the next sentence you see how i thought "
8428,420.3,Jazmin,,"so i would like for you to read the third paragraph and see if we can expand upon luis's answer that he gave us ","to confuse the lunar orbiter the right answer because they don't talk about the learner or pioneer in the third paragraph "
8436,150.1,Farrah,,"i want to talk about like i want to challenge you to look and read about the size of the us deposits ","okay this is kind of like with this is where i got my answer from "
8439,110.1,Farrah,,"that they use a scientific tool called a microscope ","oh "
8445,210.3,Farrah,,"and they did use a scientific tool called a microscope but the microscope what did it show us ","all it showed us the water they found is microscopic being you want people to see if you were looking straight at okay so you can't see it you need a scientific tool called microscope to look through the closely so you need it to look at the water okay so you need the microscope to look at the water and we know that the water is what oh microscopic "
8447,210.4,Farrah,,"microscopic so what does microscopic mean what does it tell us ","that is really really really really really really really really really really small "
8454,210.4,Oliver,,"was used does class remember what it was used to do ","to investigate ice "
8459,210.4,Chris,,"and it was in what form ","it was in the form of ice you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 yeah okay "
8465,120.2,Jazmin,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah yeah i'm trying to think i'm still kind of confused "
8469,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what's confusing you student let's see ","okay well i'm trying to put all of the words from paragraph to paragraph three together and i i'm confused i don't know how to do that "
8474,210.4,Jazmin,,"we know that nasa sent the small machine what was it called ","the lunar "
8476,210.4,Luis,,"okay the lunar orbiter and what's the lunar orbiter going to do ","investigate ice deposits "
8484,210.4,Oliver,,"we know that the water they found it was what ","i was microscopic "
8490,130.3,Oliver,,"the lunar orbiter what does it do was ","orbiter was arm ah the lunar orbiter was investigating "
8494,210.4,Oliver,,"what type of ice ","microscopic "
8497,210.4,Chris,,"microscopic us and where was the microscopic us at ","me on the moon so we're going to try to put all of our pieces together now to answer our question "
8502,210.4,Jazmin,,"and it was what did it do ","it investigated "
8504,110.1,Luis,,"ok so the lunar orbiter investigated ","microscopic ice on the moon "
8508,110.4,Oliver,,"yes the lunar orbiter investigated microscopic us on the moon that is excellent ","oh wow okay teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but wow i really really appreciate how you you help us understand all the words in the question and to use all the evidence from that story and our answer and you you made me me feel really valued and and when i had an idea to share and you listen to it and you told me how how my idea was good or maybe not good but still yeah this was for working with us "
8511,110.4,Farrah,,,"hi "
8514,230.1,Jazmin,,"um can you expand on maybe your answer of a small machine ","okay so basically it's like the thing that they sent up to the moon to go in and like to find the water "
8516,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what is what is that thing what is it called ","it's called the lunar orbiter "
8519,120.4,Luis,,"yes that is what it's called so did any of you class student student student student did any of you class see any other information about the lunar orbiter ","um yeah this is student i just wanted to say um i don't think that i have to be in this class because i kind of know like all this stuff about space already i don't really think i needed this stuff "
8522,110.3,Luis,,"um you know so much about space let's let's maybe see if you can share some of that with your classmates ","so okay yeah "
8524,230.1,Luis,,"what do you know about microscopes ","um so microscopes are like these things that you use to like study something closely like if if something's really small then you like look at it that way "
8527,230.1,Luis,,"how is it used on the moon ","um well i guess i don't really know exactly how it's used on the moon but i'm kind of imagining like you know like maybe people look through it "
8529,130.2,Farrah,,"yes maybe student do you think you can help out student ","um sure um i actually was thinking that the microscope is is probably the the tool that they use to discover water on the moon but it seems like that answers not right i'm a little confused about why "
8532,120.3,Farrah,,"so let's look back at the text so what is the question we're trying to answer ","the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8535,230.3,Jazmin,,"perfect perfect so we've talked about a couple things we talked about a microscope and we've talked about a small machine ","it's called a lunar orbiter "
8537,210.4,Farrah,,"perfect so how so we've identified the equipment so i guess back to farrahs question how do they use this equipment to look and discover water so which one do you want to focus on first the microscope or the lunar orbiter ","i'm interested in the microscope "
8539,120.3,Farrah,,"okay so if we go back and we look in the text okay do you can you class see the text ","yeah we all have it on our tablets "
8542,120.3,Oliver,,"let's look at the third paragraph does class want to read that for me ","yeah i can do it "
8545,120.3,,,,"i'm student that okay the third paragraph "
8547,120.3,Oliver,,,"okay um third paragraph that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it even if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8549,210.4,Farrah,,"good job student good job so what in that paragraph student what is that telling us about the microscope ","like that the microscope um i guess that it's something that like you would use to study something up close "
8552,210.4,Farrah,,"and if you need a microscope to see the water on the moon what does that tell you about the water ","it's really small "
8555,210.4,Farrah,,"is there a lot of it ","no i guess not a lot cuz it um yeah i guess there's not a lot because there's just a little bit to see "
8557,150.1,Chris,,"perfect okay so what other does class have any questions about the microscope because that's one of our equipment ","oh yeah it's student i don't really have a question about the microscope but i have another question um should i save it "
8559,230.1,Chris,,"well does it pertain to our article ","yeah definitely "
8563,120.4,Chris,,"well then yes go ahead and ask it ","okay so i was just wondering like okay so i went to nasa with my dad and we went and looked at like all the spacesuits and like all this stuff and like i definitely saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that like student was saying so like do you think they use those things "
8566,140.1,Chris,,"the question asked about the equipment but the article is talking about how the moon is like a desert did you see anything about the moon being like a desert when you were with your dad ","i'm not really like that wasn't really what was in the exhibit that was that was from like reading i didn't know that before today "
8571,140.1,Oliver,,"oh well that's great it seems like you learned something today did class else know that the moon is like a desert ","um yeah i sort of knew but actually i just had to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to tell you that it was really cool like having you here because you really listened to our answers and you help us listen to each other's answers and and that was really cool because sometimes we don't listen to each other very well and it was awesome that we were able to do that today so thank you so much "
8574,140.1,All,,,"hi good "
8577,150.1,Luis,,"that's good that's good so we all we all just read water on the moon and you class answered in your journal some questions ","yeah i can't "
8579,120.4,Luis,,"even you can go ahead and start ","um yeah well i was gonna say like i already kind of know all about ease so i don't think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this "
8581,140.1,Luis,,"isn't tell me what you know about space ","oh man i know all sorts of stuff i know that space is like like huge and like unimaginably huge and like it has stars and like when you go into space it's a vacuum so you have to use oxygen tanks at masks and i know that like "
8584,140.1,Luis,,"there's all this interesting stuff with like gravity and all those others ","oh yeah "
8586,120.3,Luis,,"okay well you mentioned how you know about oxygen tanks and about masks and all that good stuff so can you read to me please the second paragraph under the moon is a desert ","yeah okay um let's see so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to invest "
8590,120.3,Luis,,"can you read that yeah read the next sentence ","yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look ice deposits in a large polar crater "
8592,210.4,Luis,,"So, um, do you know anything about a lunar orbiter. ","um i know that it's something that like basically goes up to the moon and i'm like it flies around the moon orbits and and it studies the moon from from or is "
8600,120.4,Farrah,,"what do you know about equipment used in space ","well i don't really know very much about like this is the first time i like learning about it "
8603,120.3,Farrah,,"um what do you think it does according to paragraph two what does it do again what's the second sentence say ","lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar "
8605,210.4,Farrah,,"do you know what a polar crater is ","it's like i think it's like a big hole like on the moon "
8608,210.4,Farrah,,"the lunar orbiter landing at the moon south pole and basically looking around for this water on the moon ","yeah i can imagine i guess i'm still kind of use like by my answer is wrong because like i think that the lunar orbiter had to use the microscope to be able to see the water find "
8611,130.2,Oliver,,"but let's see what the point of a microscope is according to the article so do you know what paragraph or can class help student find the paragraph that a microscope is mentioned in student ","um yeah ok so the paragraph let's see they say in the last paragraph paragraph three and they say that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a my first go to look really closely "
8616,210.4,Oliver,,"based on what you just read what do you think about the what is the point of the microscope ","um well it looks like the microscope is there to study the water um and like look at it really closely i guess i kind of think the same thing i student like how could they find the water if they can't see it "
8620,120.4,Chris,,"so what are you thinking student i haven't heard much from you ","okay i have been to nasa with my dad so i know that like scientists use up like equipment like masks and suits like stuff like even said so "
8622,120.4,Chris,,,"what i'm thinking about "
8624,230.2,Chris,,"are masks and suits mentioned anywhere in the article ","no that's just what i kind of knew "
8635,120.4,Jazmin,,"what are you thinking for number two ","number two which is which one do you mean number "
8637,120.2,,,"is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","oh we can possibly answer that but unfortunately we have to go to my next thank you so much for working with it thank you "
8642,150.1,Luis,,"so we are going to start talking about is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable and i saw your previous journal entry and i want to start ","yeah "
8645,150.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i think i got this all figured out now so i think all good "
8648,120.4,Luis,,"i'm glad you haven't figured out student so can you remind the class of your answer ","i yeah okay so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
8651,120.3,Luis,,"will you reread the question for me. ","yeah okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon "
8656,110.1,Jazmin,,"could be valuable yeah so let's see what student thanks ","yeah so to me with the question means is it's asking like to testing our opinion and we have to say like yes or no the answer is the asking is the evidence convincing and and so i said that yes the evidence is convincing and that's because astronauts wanna and they can stay hydrated and and you can't survive without water "
8662,430.2,Luis,,"And Luis What you gave us is a good fact, but it's the fact that water is split into oxygen and hydrogen. So instead, let's focus on your opinion. So is there. Do you think there's evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. ","um um yeah i mean i think so cuz you can take the water and you can like what i was saying you can split it into oxygen and hydrogen like you know what i mean like you can do like some really cool stuff with it so yeah i think it's definitely value "
8666,230.3,Chris,,"you can do some cool stuff with it and student actually wrote about some cool stuff or another cool benefit of it ","yeah so i said that water is heavy so it's really good that they don't have to carry it in the ship's it "
8668,210.4,Chris,,"okay so that could be a benefit of having water so let's talk more about that who's the they that you're talking about ","the astronaut and like the spaceship "
8672,230.3,Chris,,"or it's very cumbersome for astronauts ","um well i guess i just kind of know that you know what i mean like that that waters really heavy and it it's really hard to set it in a spaceship because humans need water and it makes spaceships really "
8674,210.4,Chris,,"i'm glad you know that but it's also in the text could you read the first two sentences at the fourth paragraph for me ","oh yeah okay um water on the moon would be a valuable was very important we suppress it could be useful in lots of ways "
8676,120.3,Chris,,"and it can you continue for the next two sentences ","oh yeah yeah for example future astronauts drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft "
8684,130.2,Oliver,,"so what do you think about this student ","um okay so basically my thinking is that like i don't think it's it's very like convincing evidence that it's valuable because the water is not ready yet and we don't have like the like you know the equipment to like take the ice and make it into water like i think it would be maybe like in the future but it's not like useful now "
8687,310.1,Jazmin,,"i really think that you did a really good job identifying and separating the idea of what is valuable now versus later ","and it's just another piece about like i guess like the when student was saying this stuff about the water play you know what i mean like this this this do we need like evidence from the text when we're seeing our like our our speech like rp "
8689,420.2,Chris,,"So you don't want to have an opinion. Most of the time that is just something that you you make up because it's not necessarily true. Yes, Chris. ","i i was i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
8691,420.2,Chris,,,"oh it's okay i read that there could be a piece on them like 2020 or "
8696,140.1,Chris,,"like a i don't know if it's necessarily possible but if you read it that's super cool where do you read it up ","oh some some article in a magazine yeah i don't know if it's true either because it seems like that would be really hard to do but i think if they had a face they could use the water to survive in the base "
8706,140.1,Farrah,,"possibly so i mean at this point in time and this year anything could happen honestly i wouldn't be surprised if next year they did something crazy with everything happening yes ","so i just would surely we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that you use evidence in our answers because sometimes we just kind of like say our answers but from what we think that we don't use evidence and you really make sure that we were using the evidence but like beyond that like you really asked us about like how we got to our answers and you listen to us as we explained our ideas and i think that class here for leave value and like even beyond that like you like we're really clear with us like what we needed to work on and like let us know like you know you need to do this and think about this with your answer i think that was really helpful because i think sometimes we get confused about what we should be answering like from the text or like from our background knowledge so it was so much fun working with thank you so much "
8708,140.1,Luis,,,"i have a question um i already kind of know a lot about space already so i think i need to be in this class i don't need help with any of this stuff "
8714,410.2,Luis,,"But it doesn't make sense as far as the question goes. So let's look at the question again. I'm going to read it again what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon. So your answer doesn't really relate to that question. Do you understand that. ","yeah i think so i think so "
8716,410.2,Luis,,"so what do you think may be a better answer as far as because again your answer pretty solid as far as a comprehension of space but as far as discovering water oxygen tanks don't really have anything to do with that ","wow i guess i didn't really read it that well closely so maybe i didn't i didn't i didn't really read it "
8718,420.3,Luis,,"so maybe you should go back and just read it and look for some specifics on how scientists or what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay "
8729,420.3,Chris,,"so if you'll just go back in the text and try to find some specifics on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay yeah i can do that sounds good yeah "
8732,420.2,Oliver,,"and talk about yourself not another student ","okay "
8734,110.1,Farrah,,"and student you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","yeah "
8738,110.2,Farrah,,"so right now your answer seems pretty solid ","i'm wondering though because we had to work on it together is my answer is my answer wrong "
8740,110.2,Farrah,,,"no it's student um i was just wondering like if if my answer is wrong like why it might be wrong "
8742,110.2,Farrah,,"so student your answer's i don't think your answer is incorrect your answer's your answer is correct ","oh okay great "
8746,420.2,Farrah,,"that way if i had no clue if i've never read the text i'll read your question i know exactly what you're talking about when we answer ","okay yeah "
8750,420.2,Chris,,,"um okay so this is the thing that i'm kind of wondering about like basically i'm wondering like when i went to nasa with my dad like we went and we saw like all these space suits and all that stuff like the oxygen tanks that student was talking about so like did they have to use like this space suits and like the oxygen tanks to like go and like study the water like i'm just a little confused "
8756,210.4,Chris,,"for an organized sport you're probably going to need a jersey right to play ","yeah that makes sense "
8759,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense student ","yeah it does "
8762,150.1,Oliver,,,"um so we have to go to lunch now but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for a second for for working with us especially like you were very patient with our answers and you really listened to our answers and also we were able to listen to each other better because you were really listening to our answers and i just really appreciate it and wanted to make sure you knew that thanks "
8766,150.1,Luis,,,"hi excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
8771,110.3,Luis,,"and that obviously shows your understanding of space that's really cool ","uh huh "
8773,210.2,Luis,,"we look at that question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon what are we really looking for ","um okay the equipment they use to discover the water "
8775,110.4,Luis,,"absolutely equipment they used to discover the water ","i'm okay it's like when you got a space you know and and or when you're looking for the telescope and then you see a new a new planet or no star and you're like oh wow you know like i discovered her new star i discovered a new planet like that "
8778,210.2,Luis,,"that's true so it's new to you it's new to whoever finds it that's absolutely true ","yeah no no no no you're right yeah oxygen tanks we don't we don't discover water with the tanks we just we don't need them to breathe on the moon "
8782,110.1,Jazmin,,"and that's cool you know that so now i'm going to help another student ","i don't understand why my answers wrong "
8791,430.2,Jazmin,,"what i would like you to do though is instead of just saying nasa sent a small machine we need to make that answer specific by using the name of the machine ","If they just said, okay, a small machine. I mean, I guess, I guess no. Um, okay. So if you wanted to know the small, um, I guess, to tell you something about it. "
8793,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah tell me something about it and what else what identifies that machine ","um what it looks like or what it size "
8795,210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah and then also um so when i'm talking to you i'm gonna say student ","yeah my name "
8798,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah your name so probably the machines name as well ","yeah yeah "
8801,130.1,Jazmin,,"all right but you're definitely on the right ","okay so i just have to add more at the name and stuff to it "
8804,430.2,Jazmin,,"yes just make it more specific and tie in the question so instead just go in and answer what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon ","Okay. "
8806,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah i think i got it "
8809,150.1,Chris,,,"yeah i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits "
8816,110.2,Chris,,"Okay, so I'm glad you you've noticed that. ","like you said to student the name of the equipment the name of the equipment that they used oh yeah i didn't write the name of the equipment "
8822,310.1,Chris,,"You do a great job of talking about the question. So you obviously understand the question. As far as that goes. . ","OK, OK, OK, I can do that. "
8824,310.1,Oliver,,,"hey mr martin i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um but i did when i say thanks for taking time to work with us what we'll have to see you after lunch "
8826,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
8831,310.1,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
8833,110.1,Luis,,"so water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen that's what you said yeah ","i think i got it this time "
8841,430.2,Luis,,"so right now you have some evidence water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen but i would like you to restate the question and then answer the question because we need to put whether it is convincing or it is not convincing evidence that the water on the moon could be valuable ","Okay. okay so i gotta say yes or no um and then i write then i so i gotta put a couple a sentence before before i write before my answer so i just got to like add a couple more sentences first that says yes or no "
8844,230.3,Luis,,"from your evidence it sounds like you think yes is that true ","yeah i "
8849,420.2,Luis,,"then you would say in the text what it says water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and then you would explain why that's important ","i gotta write all of that stuff that's a lot "
8851,150.1,Luis,,"but then your answer is gonna be awesome you can do it i believe you can do it ","okay "
8857,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay does that make sense ","yeah yeah okay okay yeah cuz i did say yes "
8860,420.2,Jazmin,,"right if you could say there is enough evidence that water on the moon can you class and then you're off you're saying yes you're just also bringing the question into it ","okay okay all right "
8862,420.2,Farrah,,,"mr teacher i'm still confused "
8869,210.4,Oliver,,"but if we're just going completely off what the text says if you will read number four that might change your answer just go back and reread number four ","Okay, I'll read it, but I guess that's why I was confused because I felt like you know I did better this time. And I did, I did read it, I got mine from I'm from from I think from paragraph number six. yeah me too i mean i did read it this time and and and and and number six is how that it'll take a lot of time and money so that sounds to me like you know it's not right so that means no "
8874,120.1,Oliver,,"So on there, you can make that on so again. ","your said to student that he has to restate the question and an answer the question and give evidence okay so i guess i can restate the question but i feel like i answered the question "
8877,420.2,Farrah,,"found the evidence from number six that's perfect just provide that evidence and then explain ","okay okay so so i'm not wrong my answer is not wrong "
8880,210.3,Chris,,"no it's not it's you just need to support it ","okay okay um okay yeah mr teacher i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
8889,420.2,Chris,,"yeah so that that's a good train of thought so now if we'll just restate the question answer the question ","Okay so you can't tell that I need more evidence or I have enough evidence right cuz I pulled it from the story. "
8891,420.2,Chris,,,"but i "
8893,420.2,Chris,,"i would say that you do need more evidence your evidence does say that bringing water on the moon is hard but i would also talk about how the water on the moon would be good ","okay ok "
8900,420.2,Oliver,,,"ok ok ok ok i think i'm thinking about it i on i just have to add more to my story um but i i also just looked at the clock and it's it's time for the next class um but i do want to appreciate that i feel like you did you you made me feel valued in and how i was thinking about the question and i think i do understand that i just need more specifically to add more evidence um yeah i think are sorry student and i was just i felt kind of good to cuz i feel like i know that what i need to work on as to add more evidence to and to i guess um i'll say more about the question itself as aren't right "
8903,420.2,,,,"okay great oh thanks mr teacher this was really good okay we'll see you next time bye thank you bye "
8905,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i know like all about space so like i don't think i need any help like i don't think i need to be in this class "
8910,130.1,Jazmin,,"student and oliveron you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at the water on the moon and you class are both on the right track you class are really thinking and i like where you're headed ","let's see okay the question is what equipment do you use to discover water on the moon "
8913,420.1,Farrah,,"okay great thank you so does class have any keywords that would help us to look back in the text and determine what exactly are we looking for ","um i just wanted to check what what is a keyword "
8915,420.1,Farrah,,"a keyword is an important word that is going to give us a clue as to what we're going to be looking for to answer our question ","oh okay gotcha "
8918,510.1,Farrah,,"so for example i might say the equipment that the scientist used to discover on the moon would be and then leave that answer blank and then we could go back in the text to determine what exactly what equipment ","um so okay so that's really interesting so like the arm so like the key the keyword would be like what what like equipment like equipment is that a keyword "
8921,210.2,Oliver,,"well first of all can class tell me what equipment means can class give me another word for equipment ","yeah um i would say like like a tool or like yeah like like a tool "
8925,420.3,Chris,,"a tool absolutely that is perfect so if you class could take a second to look back in the texts and find different equipment or tools what equipment or tools do you see mentioned in the text ","So I actually had kind of a question. I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA. And when we went. We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that. So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools? but i was wondering but do you think they they use them but did they did they not use them to to measure things with the microscope like the astronauts i'm like i guess it's not in the in the reading and i was wondering about that "
8929,420.3,Jazmin,,"helmets and all the other equipment are absolutely things that would be used to go to the moon but let's link equipment and or tools to discover water on the moon do you see any tools that could be used to discover water on the moon let's look back in the text and see if we see any tools oh we've already get some ideas student what do you see what do you think ","what i think is so it's like what i said was like the small machine and then when i was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine it's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one two that you would have to use right like to get there "
8933,210.4,Oliver,,"nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate there you go that's our keyword student so a lunar orbiter to investigate can someone else continue reading for me to see what this lunar orbiter does ","um yeah i can do it this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
8935,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so what exactly do the lunar orbiters do based on our reading student can you tell us what do you think ","so it sounds like rhey look for the ice deposits but they they go searching for it like they're the thing that finds it right "
8937,210.3,Farrah,,"yes absolutely so i see that we have let's look at back at some of our answers so i see that we looked at our question what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon so i see we have our answers are a microscope a small machine and then we have some other equipment which answer makes the most sense as to what would be found on the moon student ","i'm actually i'm so sorry because we're really enjoying this but we have to go to lunch so before we go though i just wanted to thank you like this was really interesting for us the way that you let this class like we were really able to like think through really clearly like what we were studying and and like able to sort of like understand better and i think like you really led us through that process and it was really interesting like thank you so much "
8944,220.1,Luis,,"you class put some really great work in and had some good answer choices but i don't feel that we have a complete understanding of what the question is asking so firstly what i want to do is ","me "
8946,220.1,Luis,,,"just shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
8949,150.1,Luis,,"you already know all about space alright well how about you stick with us for a little bit and see if we can teach you something new okay ","sure okay it says oh what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
8953,210.2,Farrah,,"what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon first of all i want to make sure that we know what the word equipment means so can class give me a synonym for the word equipment ","a tool "
8956,140.1,Oliver,,"a tool so give me some examples of tools debbie had your hand raised can you give me an example of a tool ","yeah so um one on are playing a video game when i use my xbox controller and that's equipment about are you so that's like a tool "
8962,140.1,Luis,,"yeah absolutely that's absolutely right is there class else that wanted to share a tool ","okay well i was gonna say that to death so um ok ok so when we go to pe sometimes it's not a tool but sometimes a pe teacher when we're playing basketball you'll be like okay class go get the equipment and we have to go get the basketballs "
8965,210.4,Jazmin,,"in the texts that are going to talk about equipment so first of all we know we're looking for equipment that was used to find what student ","find water "
8971,210.3,Jazmin,,"now that you've had time to look back what equipment do we see in this passage ","circled to but the one i circled i think is right so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
8974,210.3,Jazmin,,"so student that you said that nasa sent a small machine so what two words did you find what two words or what two pieces of equipment did you find ","the small machine and the scientific tool "
8978,230.2,Jazmin,,"let's look at the sentence where you found a small machine go ahead and read that whole sentence where small machine is included ","okay this isn't a small machine coated lunar orbiter to investigate "
8983,210.4,Jazmin,,"about that small machine what was that called ","the lunar orbiter "
8989,210.3,Farrah,,"in why microscope wasn't the best choice ","it makes sense but they still use the microscope to look at the water so why why i don't know why that's not the best choice because they're both they're both equipped "
8993,210.4,Farrah,,"found types of equipment then we want to look and see which one's the best so let's look in the area where it talked about the microscope so we are on the first page in paragraph number three so student would you go ahead and read that paragraph to us please ","yeah it says that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
8999,210.4,Chris,,"out of water they found is microscopic meaning you want to be able to look straight at it and that you would need a tool but is it saying that they've already used a microscope to look at it ","oh um you need you need all okay okay you need a scientific tall to look really closely on yeah also student i think i think i guess we didn't read that fully i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
9011,420.3,Oliver,,"Be able to better answer text and another thing rereading the text, maybe will help get a deeper understanding of the text. ","um no i'm sorry to interrupt but if i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we got a gold "
9013,420.3,All,,,"thanks okay see you later "
9016,150.1,Luis,,"i think you class have somewhat of an understanding to what the question is asking but i don't think we are fully there yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in that spot i already know all about space "
9022,120.3,Jazmin,,"i want to look back at the question so student would you go ahead and read the question for us ","okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
9028,210.2,Jazmin,,"asking what are those important words go ahead ","okay i think it's saying like i'm like um what what kind of things did the astronauts use to find water on the moon "
9035,210.2,Jazmin,,"Mean ","okay well there's another word story it's a tool a scientific tool so that's how i know the microscope is right cuz that equipment but but i think it's machine because that's what i had and that's equivalent to so i don't know what my answer is wrong "
9045,130.2,Chris,,"equipment ","i wasn't in my answer but i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
9053,230.2,Luis,,"in the text where you found small machine and microscope and i want you class to tell me what paragraph in the text is a small machine in the microscope ","okay i'm not a lot of different equipment "
9066,230.2,Oliver,,"So So Deb. Let's look at microscope. Did you find where we can find microscope and and there ","girl yeah it's in paragraph three it's that one is the last one the last one and this is where i got my answer me too "
9068,120.3,Oliver,,"okay so go ahead and read that last sentence for us ","okay so it says on your needle scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
9070,210.4,Oliver,,"okay so did it say that they used a microscope ","um "
9073,210.4,Farrah,,"a scientific tool ","oh yeah okay okay yeah we did learn about that you would need doesn't mean that you you are using it means like me yeah "
9078,210.4,Jazmin,,"a lunar ","orbiter i have a day yeah that was my answer "
9088,150.1,Chris,,"so does that make sense student i saw your hand go up so does that make sense as to why ","no no i was just i was thinking okay i was on a piece of equipment he said the microscope and then student said a different one the small machine and since it says you want me you would need the microscope but not that you do need oh "
9093,130.1,Chris,,"was not with that microscope ","okay okay um this is this is this is hard to kind of figure out cuz cuz i like i can hear both of their ideas and i think i feel like the keyword is like you would need which says that they they didn't use it "
9099,130.1,Chris,,,"okay okay okay that was good thanks miss pickett it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say that i appreciate it how you you really like asked class questions about their answers so we got we got to kind of think about why we made our answers um and and like how you ask student to like find his answer in the story and um yeah i think i think i'm thinking about now looking at the story and really trying to find more of the words just looking at more of the words in the story to see if that if that will work for the question "
9102,110.1,All,,"Well you guys did awesome today. Thank you so much and I will see you later. ","Bye bye. "
9104,110.1,Oliver,,,"we're doing well glad to see you "
9106,110.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so basically um here's the thing i know like a lot about space and i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff about space "
9109,120.3,Luis,,"well that's fantastic how about you be the one to read paragraph two for us again because it seems like we're a little confused on the correct answer here and i want to see if we can hone in on it ","okay um paragraph two nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
9115,120.4,Jazmin,,"are you finished ","no i'm ready to answer "
9119,120.4,Farrah,,"10 more seconds 987654321 all right let's actually start with student and we'll move our way around the circle to student so what word did you circle student ","so with that i circled was ice ice deposits and and i circled it because you know you had one because they say in there that the ice deposits are very small and so like you have to you have to use the microscope to see the ice deposits and ice water "
9122,230.3,Oliver,,"very true so so we know that ice is the water we know that the water that we find is very small okay so that's very good we're going to keep that in the back of our brains ","um so i circled the part that says very small kind of for the same reason but like the fact that you have to use a microscope to look at the ice deposits "
9125,230.3,Chris,,"okay very good so where we're thinking about how small the water is ","um yeah so i kind of went in i was looking at like um i guess lunar orbiter "
9128,230.1,Chris,,"okay can you tell me why you chose lunar orbiter ","well it just kind of looked like the you know man like it just kind of looked like the other like the machine you know they said like what equipment i just i don't know it seemed like the most machine or equipment looking word "
9132,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what did you put ","i circled the same thing small machine i'm talking about the lunar orbiter "
9136,120.4,Luis,,"and student what did you put ","well okay so i didn't really read it that closely "
9139,230.1,Luis,,"and what do you know have you heard the word lunar orbiter before do you know that phrase ","yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah so i just didn't really know what to like what to circle i just figured yeah but i know in the lunar orbiter is "
9141,230.1,Luis,,"okay do you know what a microscope is ","yeah yeah it's like what you look in like a like a like a magnifying glass but it's like you look at smaller things "
9144,120.4,Jazmin,,"but what did student and student tell us about how the microscope got up there ","it said that "
9146,120.4,Jazmin,,"class want to ","yeah we said that basically that it was the lunar orbiter and it something that went to the moon and it was something like like that was the craft or the spaceship that like went up to the moon and landed and like found the water "
9150,130.2,Farrah,,"okay class student what do you think do you agree with student or no ","well i agree with student i'm because i'm not really sure like well student had a question about it yeah so my question was like how do you like i'm not quite sure why it sounds like maybe the lunar orbiter is the answer but i'm not really sure why the microscopes not the answer you know "
9152,120.3,Farrah,,"sure so student why don't you go ahead and read our discussion question to us ","um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
9155,210.2,Farrah,,"very good and student what do you think the most important word in that question is ","equipment "
9160,120.4,Luis,,"seems to be where we're at student do you have something to share ","okay yes i think that the most important word is discover because like finding it okay and student you had your hand up what would you like to add yeah i agree with student i i think i'm around now to thinking that the lunar orbiter is the thing that discovered the water "
9167,210.3,Farrah,,"right so the microscope does help us see the water but what's the thing that helps us get to the water in the first place ","um well it's basically it's the lunar orbiter i think i think that's a lot more clear now we actually have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and especially i wanted to thank you for really like working patiently with each of us and like drawing out the answers kind of piece by piece and letting us do our own kind of like thinking as we went along and then like connecting with each other's thinking was really cool since because we don't always get along as a class so that was pretty cool thank you so much "
9170,210.3,Luis,,,"um thanks teacher "
9173,120.4,Luis,,"so looking over your responses and it seems like class has read the article yes you had a question ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
9175,210.4,Luis,,"yeah and what is one thing that you know about space that can help us ","okay so i know that astronauts can't breathe and space so they need to wear oxygen mask so that they can walk around and stuff "
9179,230.3,Luis,,"hold your thought we're going to get to your your comment because you talked about suit scientists using a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and oxygen masks in space ","Mm hmm. Um, maybe they use like I'm a shovel to dig it up. "
9186,120.4,Farrah,,"so that we can answer yes ma'am ","okay i think the most important word is equipment "
9188,230.1,Farrah,,"why do you think equipment is the most important word ","um because it's like the first noun in the question "
9191,120.4,Chris,,"but let's hold that yes you have your hand raised what do you think the most important word is ","Yeah okay, I'm Chris. I think the most important word is water. "
9193,230.1,Chris,,"water now student why do you think water is the most important question or word ","the whole the whole story is called water on the moon so "
9197,230.3,Oliver,,"and i think you're absolutely right that we need to look at our title so we have water we have equipment ","okay i can do that it's me student okay so um so like there's water on the moon they're looking for the water and then they find some water on but it's not a lot of water so then they have to use a microscope to see the water "
9201,120.4,Jazmin,,"when you have that tool identified or that piece of equipment go ahead and raise your hand ","teacher "
9203,120.4,Jazmin,,,"i thought i did that so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9205,210.3,Jazmin,,"so you did point out that nasa a small machine but a microscope is a small machine right ","yeah "
9208,420.2,Chris,,"see if you can find it ","if it's jazmin's i saw that one the name of its lunar orbiter "
9212,210.4,Chris,,"and we have found out that the lunar orbiter helps us find the water which in turn we use the microscope because we know that there's not a lot of water on the moon ","you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
9216,120.2,Oliver,,"let's recap question one what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what did we decide ","okay well you said that it was what student and student said but i i don't understand why me and student are wrong "
9219,230.3,Farrah,,"why the microscope is not the answer ","cuz that looks like it's still the answer to me "
9221,210.2,Oliver,,"In this question, lets you know that we're looking for a specific piece of equipment. ","i thought it was something that would find some water but i feel like that's not it now "
9225,210.2,Oliver,,"so what we need to look at in our article is what was the first piece of equipment that was used because discover is like when you find it for the first time right ","oh oh ok ok so the lunar orbiter comes before the microscope in the story "
9228,110.1,Oliver,,"you are correct very good ","okay um yeah it's cause it's cards it comes first in the story "
9230,230.3,Oliver,,"very good so it comes first in the story and then we use the microscope to identify the water ","okay okay well it's time for us to go um so i want to take thanks for coming to work with us and we'll see you next time "
9232,230.3,Oliver,,,"bye bye "
9236,230.3,Luis,,"hey kiddos so looking at question two i'm seeing everybody's responses and it looks like we are split between water being valuable and if there's evidence for and water not being valuable ","think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
9238,230.1,Luis,,"all right and what do you have figured out ","okay so i read the story and i looked for the evidence and i pulled something right out of the story and not out of my big massive brain "
9242,210.3,Luis,,"my question for you would be how do you know that water is valuable even if it can be split what can we use those two parts for would be my question to you ","okay wow i mean i know that we can use oxygen to breathe i don't remember what what you can use hydrogen for "
9244,210.4,Jazmin,,"so you're absolutely right we can use oxygen to breathe and that is one of the neat things about being able to find water in space is that we can use water on its own which we use for what ","we use it for drinking that was my answer "
9251,120.1,Jazmin,,"raise your hand when you find find an answer ","okay so i see the thing that i said about how you could drink it um but then in the paragraph five that you said there was a thing about how you can make fuel so the spacecraft can move "
9256,210.4,Jazmin,,"now how student do you can you tell me how we can use water as a rocket fuel because we can't just pour water in a rocket and make it go ","no okay it says oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel um that's what it says "
9259,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you think we use the water plain water as rocket fuel or do we have to split the water and use those two separate parts ","i guess it would be like how student said where you do split it "
9261,110.4,Jazmin,,"very good ","good split it in two parts "
9263,110.4,Farrah,,,"oh yeah so i see what you're saying but i'm still kind of confused "
9266,230.1,Farrah,,"what are you confused about ","well cuz i found a different answer and so if if they're right that it could be valuable but what the story says that i'm okay so i said no not for a long time because then the next paragraph it says that it will take a lot of time and energy so it it sounds like they don't actually have the time or the money to do it "
9270,120.3,Farrah,,"but read the question to me one more time ","okay um is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
9273,210.2,Oliver,,"Do you think it is worth trying to get the water out of the moon. ","okay okay okay well i have that same answer as student because i read that class para i i think i think yeah yeah "
9275,230.1,Oliver,,"why do you think it is a valuable resource student ","okay cause on the thing that student said about drinking it i mean like class needs to drink water and then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space "
9278,110.4,Farrah,,"right so we have water we have rocket fuel ","okay um so i was thinking about what class said and i'm oh yeah i would say the thing about us breathing the oxygen to "
9280,230.3,Farrah,,"right so we can use it to breathe as well and i think breathing and staying alive in space is very important ","yeah i think so too "
9282,210.3,Farrah,,"oh student would you change your answer or do you want to keep it the same as what you've already put down ","no no i would change it because now we can see that there's a bunch of stuff that that does say that waters valuable in the in the story "
9284,210.3,Chris,,,"and well i read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
9287,230.1,Chris,,"that would be crazy if there's a moon base on the moon then that means what what do you think that would mean ","that they could use the fuel to like fill up the rocket and then to go back home "
9292,230.1,Chris,,"if we can refill up on the moon what do you think that would mean ","um if we call refill on the moon people wouldn't get stranded on the moon "
9294,140.1,Chris,,"they wouldn't get stranded you are right think about like a gas station so if you drive very far and you need to fill up on a gas station at a gas station what does it allow you to do if you have a way to fill up your car halfway through a trip ","we wouldn't run out of gas "
9296,140.1,Jazmin,,"you won't run out of gas and it lets you like you're not gonna if we're going to the beach and we run out of gas halfway and there's a gas station we're not gonna turn back around right ","no we'll just get more gas "
9301,230.3,Oliver,,"so i think i think you class have it i think we are understanding that water is valuable because it allows us to do all these different things especially if we can put a moon base on the moon ","yeah yeah okay thanks so much mr teacher i'm a class i do feel like you helped me i'm looking keep looking up a question more cuz me and student had a good answer but i think we missed some of the other evidence and the story to build our answer so um thanks for helping us think about reading my question and all the words in a question and i'm looking for all of the best story "
9303,230.3,Oliver,,,"thanks mr teacher we'll see you next time "
9307,230.3,Luis,,,"um don't excuse me but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
9309,220.1,Luis,,"yeah well that's good that you corrected your answer and we are going to look at it again and we're going to see if we can dig deeper together and figure out a more precise answer something with a little bit more evidence okay ","okay yeah i can stick around for that right "
9314,420.1,Oliver,,"but what i want to do before we start is take a minute and look back at question number one you class are going to be looking for keywords in the question important words that you could look for back in your text that way we can answer the question ","okay so i found the keyword i thought equipment was really important "
9317,130.2,Chris,,"did class find a different word than equipment in question one ","um yeah i i thought water was the important word "
9322,130.2,Jazmin,,"somebody help student out what is another word that is maybe only said once or twice that we could look for in the text what's another keyword somebody else found ","so for me i thought discover was maybe the most important keywords and so i thought is like you think the equipment that then you're like discovering using the equipment so i thought discover "
9328,210.4,Farrah,,"but let's go back and look at where it talks about the microscope so that is in question or paragraph number two or a paragraph number three is where they talk about using the microscope ","oh yeah i was just gonna say i had changed my answer "
9330,220.1,Farrah,,"yes i noticed that you changed your answer and we're going to hang out i do like that you what you changed your answer to and so we are going to use some of what you thought and how you got to your answer we're going to help other people in this class use that same thought process okay ","thank you "
9334,420.3,Chris,,"okay so if we are looking in paragraph number three look and reread that real quick and remember we are looking for the words equipment and discover let me know if you find either of those words in that paragraph ","they said that the waters microscopic and so i thought like if that was a keyword than that but you said that will actually okay you said that that wasn't like all over the text so actually what i was looking at is that they said you need the water they found that was it the water they found because i was thinking discover like that keyword and and i thought found was the word "
9338,210.4,Farrah,,"now student in your answer in your response you named a type of machine what was that machine ","in my in my revised response yeah so i said the lunar orbiter was how they discovered the little bits of water "
9340,230.2,Farrah,,"yeah and student where did you find your answer for lunar orbiter were in the text did you find that ","so i saw it in paragraph two and that was yeah that was right "
9342,230.2,Chris,,,"yeah i just wanted to check actually that okay is my new answer okay it's the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic "
9346,420.1,Chris,,"and your answer is closer to a correct answer but what were what was the keywords in number one what were the keywords ","um okay it wasn't water it was equipment and discover right Oh. No, it doesn't. So that actually makes sense. So I didn't really answer the question, I just was I did. I understand. Oh, that's exciting. I really understand "
9348,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah say student said that she found her answer in paragraph two student what do you have to say ","um i just wanted to say unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with thank you so much "
9350,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah hi so i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm all good "
9352,150.1,Luis,,"well let's double check our answers that way we know for sure that we have answered the question the way that it's asking us to ok ","ok "
9357,210.2,Farrah,,"so we are going to use the same strategy the same technique and take about 30 seconds and find any keywords in that question okay keywords are something important to help us find the answer back in the text ","i thought was like my keyword was convincing and then valuable "
9360,130.2,Chris,,"yeah so convincing is an important word and i do like valuable valuable is a good one also convincing what is it convincing convincing what what are we being convinced of does class have a word to go along with savannas word convincing ","um well i said evidence as as well so like i guess it goes together like convincing evidence "
9364,120.1,Jazmin,,"student what is the second heading ","water is a valuable resource "
9367,210.2,Jazmin,,"excellent so what keyword from our question have we already found from this heading ","well actually i was just saying i'm still kind of confused "
9372,420.2,Jazmin,,"so the best place to start is the keywords in the question and then going back to those headings to try and see if we can look underneath that heading for an answer ","did i give like convincing evidence in my answer "
9374,110.2,Jazmin,,"you did um ","yeah cuz i said that yes that there's convincing evidence and i said astronaut drink the water and stay hydrated and that you can't survive without water "
9381,230.2,Luis,,"no where else has somebody found something that's convincing evidence ","um yeah so for me like okay so i was looking at the text this time because you were saying we should do that like we should read it closely and i thought that like convincing evidence is like the fact that i even it's all the paragraphs like it says in paragraph four water on the moon could be valuable useful in lots of ways could be astronauts could drink it and then also in paragraph five it says moon water could be useful in other ways it can be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen "
9387,230.2,Oliver,,"What what they what those parts are going to be used for how are they going to use oxygen. How are they going to use the hydrogen? ","um yeah so i was just gonna say that i read that there was that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
9392,420.2,Oliver,,"okay um i have not heard that but let's think about this text though okay so you and student and student student did you have a question your hand was up just a second ago ","i was actually no i think i forgot what i was gonna say So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I really just wanted to thank you and like specifically i wanted to thank you for a couple things like you help us understand like how to look for keywords and how to make sure that we were like "
9395,120.3,Luis,,"so let's go back up the text has one two and three so in looking at the one two and three they're short little sentences ","excuse me "
9397,120.3,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
9401,120.2,Luis,,"and i think that's super cool but the question was what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ","yeah definitely because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks "
9405,210.3,Luis,,"did people go up on the moon in this article what we just read did it say anything about people being on the moon in this article ","um let me see "
9415,120.2,Jazmin,,"let's do student what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong, cuz I did pull from that I said a small machine. And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know? "
9417,210.3,Jazmin,,"that is true is there a title of that machine is there a name of that machine in number two ","the lunar orbiter "
9420,130.3,Jazmin,,"and that is the name it's not capitalized like your name jazmin's capitalized student is not is capitalized but lunar orbiter is not but when it says called a lunar orbiter that's the title and that would be the answer they're looking for ","thank you "
9424,230.3,Chris,,"you are welcome and student you looked at found craters full of water on the moon right ","yeah yeah cuz i found that in the in the story like it was really cool that they have all these craters and like and and they thought the moon was a desert but then the craters like it's got all this water in it "
9427,120.3,Chris,,"so reading back through and what student had just talked about with this small machine ","want me to read read where i got my answer from or you want me to read where student got her answer from "
9430,230.2,Chris,,"where did you get your answer from student ","my answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says scientists have evidence the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters so that's that's where i got my part but i do hear what you said about like why what did they use to find the polar craters i guess "
9432,210.3,Chris,,"yeah and after number one where you got your answer did you read the rest of the response the rest of the article ","yeah yeah i read the whole thing and and i wanted to tell you when you were talking student about you know the oxygen tanks that i went to nasa with my dad and so i know also that like scientists use a lot of different equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
9434,110.3,Chris,,"yeah and this lunar orbiter like we are talking about that's super cool ","so yeah i think i might have seen that at nasa i just realized that cool "
9437,230.2,Farrah,,"where did you find your answer ","it was in paragraph three when it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
9439,210.3,Oliver,,"yeah so they did talk about using a microscope and that is equipment but is that what they used on the moon was there a microscope up there on the moon that they use to look at it or do they need them something else before they could use the microscope ","well i have the same answer as student and i remember when i was looking in the story it was saying the water they found is microscopic i'm told me that they found the water and and and it says you need a microscope so i figure they must have brought a microscope to to see the water "
9442,110.1,Oliver,,"that's true but that is true so with the microscope ","i'm sorry i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and and we just met but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch so i want to say thank you i really appreciate how you gave like all of us like a chance to kind of talk you know and to share our ideas so that was that was pretty cool okay bye "
9445,110.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
9447,110.1,Luis,,,"excuse me and i shouldn't be and this class um i already know all about space "
9449,140.1,Luis,,"do you ","mhmm "
9453,230.1,Luis,,"can you tell me some facts from the story that we read ","yeah sure okay so like astronauts go to space cuz are looking for water on the moon and they they have to wear as spacesuits because they can't breathe on the moon and they go up in their space shuttle that's how you get from you know like from from the earth to the moon those are some facts about space that i know "
9455,230.1,Luis,,"do you know what people are called when they go to space like what is their job title ","yeah they're astronauts "
9458,130.2,Oliver,,"exactly so in that reading piece astronauts went to space and the company called nasa sent a piece of equipment up to space does class remember the name of that piece of equipment ","i think the equipment was a microscope i had a microscope too "
9460,210.3,Oliver,,"they used a microscope but what was the name of the machine that they needed to use in space do you remember ","well a microscope is a machine "
9462,130.3,Jazmin,,"nope so in the text it said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ","that's close to my idea cuz i said in my answer i said that nasa since the small machine but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9466,120.4,Farrah,,"and then student can you explain your answer ","yeah sure okay like in the third paragraph they were talking about finding the water and it said the water they found is microscopic and then it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i was thinking you know like a scientific tool is kind of same thing you know as equipment so that's how i came up with that answer "
9469,230.1,Oliver,,"good job student what made you come up with your answer choice ","well i know that the question was asking for water and i know that we have to find equipment so i was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it you need to have a tool called a microscope so kind of like what student was saying about how microscope is a tool i was thinking you know like how you said um like is equipment and the paragraph says that they found the water and that was what the question was asking about finding water yeah that's what i have "
9472,230.1,Chris,,"student when you talk about scientists found craters will have water on the moon how did you come up with that answer ","yeah sure cuz question was asking you know them finding the water like like how student said so i was looking at the text okay where do they find the water and it says in paragraph one that at first they didn't think that there was any water and they realized that they were wrong and they found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater so like that's where i found my answer "
9474,210.4,Chris,,"okay so if we go back and we look at this reading passage does class know any reading skills we could have used to have answered these questions what key pieces could we have highlighted in the passage to help us answer this question ","i highlighted the part in the question that says discovery water but i didn't see discovering there so i just i found that found and water and so that's how i use that you know i also want to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
9476,210.2,Chris,,"exactly student when you hear the word equipment what similar words come to mind ","like those oxygen tanks so that they breathe and like there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death you know "
9482,210.4,Chris,,"so as you're reading what physical objects came in the passage to your mind ","like in paragraph two nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter lunar orbiter okay that's the one that student said i think and they say that's like four glasses glasses is is an object but that's not that's not so i mean it's the same one that student said right the small machine called the lunar orbiter right "
9487,420.2,Oliver,,"and then to be more specific in our answer we could have put the name and what is that machine called ","i definitely well i i know it's called a lunar orbiter cuz i'm student just set it and student said it too and you said it but i'm sorry to interrupt you i know it's it's it's time first of all to lunch i know this was really short and i really appreciate how you really took some time to help us really kind of think about the words in the question and and look for other words and the story too bye "
9491,150.1,Luis,,"hi class so today we are going to talk about our answers to the question that you class needed to answer and i want to first say thank you for answering the question so what i want us to first start with is i want us to all look back to the ","um yeah basically i was just gonna say like i kind of know all ready all about space so i don't think i need to be in this room "
9494,110.3,Luis,,"and if you i would like you to use your knowledge that you already know to share with the other students in the class okay so ","yeah i can do that "
9506,210.3,Luis,,"do you underline ","yeah so i underlined let's see when i looked at it i underlined equipment and i'm um i underlined equipment that was the main word that i underline ok "
9509,210.3,Farrah,,"ok so now that you've had time to share with the person beside you i would like for one person in each class to share their answers with the class so student and deb you want to view give me what words you class underlying the question ","yeah absolutely okay so what we underlined when we were looking at it we underlined and discover and i was just gonna say like i was kind of wondering if i was to kind of use like what my answer was wrong "
9513,210.2,Chris,,"okay and good i like how you underline the equipment and discover because those are the two keywords to help us answer this question student and student what words did you class underline ","so we actually had a kind of a decision about my so i underlined up with ben and water and student underlying discovery "
9516,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay justin why did you underline discover ","and so basically i repeat visits as he like the question say like what did they use to define the water or like discovered the water so it seems like that would be an important thing to look for "
9523,420.2,Luis,,"so student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks how could you be more specific to the passage ","um you mean like to the reading "
9527,410.1,Luis,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon oxygen tanks are pieces of equipment but they don't really go with the water on the moon ","so so i "
9533,410.1,Luis,,,"guess more specific well i guess like i guess i'm not totally sure like what what to look for because i thought like the equipment was anything that they you know anything that they use to like find the water so like if they were on the moon they'd have to use like suits and masks and stuff um but like you know what i mean like i'm not quite sure like what else like to say "
9537,210.4,Luis,,"and in the text it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate can you show me where it says that in the text can you point to it ","yeah it was um in paragraph two it's in the first sentence "
9546,210.3,Farrah,,"yeah okay so do you know why your answer could have wasn't the best answer ","well i guess i guess i'm still because like oh you know like i think that the microscope was what they use like it feels like i guess i don't know does it seem like that was what they used to find the water because they said in the in the writing that you couldn't see the water unless you use the microscope so i was thinking like that's what they used to discover and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much okay "
9558,210.3,Luis,,"student what keywords could we underline in this question to help us answer with the best answer ","so i put in for my answer i underlined equipment "
9560,210.3,Luis,,"okay i like how you underlined equipment that is a good word to underline you are correct is there another word in that question to help us under to help us answer the question ","um well maybe discover "
9564,210.3,Farrah,,"that may not in depth can one of you tell me what words you class underline ","oh yeah okay so the underlying reach every reader equipment and discover "
9571,210.3,Jazmin,,"student how could you be more specific and answering your and your answer yes student ","well i guess i was just gonna ask if if if we should all answer but it sounds like we should actually under sure like which is why my answers wrong and i realized that should be more specific but like you said totally sure like how i should be more specific "
9577,310.1,Jazmin,,"Answer and asking why ","it makes sense so he needs to say like like he might be more specific about like what it is "
9582,210.3,Farrah,,"student how could you be more specific in your answer ","i'm i'm not totally sure i think i feel like our answer is right each "
9587,210.3,Farrah,,"to find that answer ","well i guess when i think about discovering the pot i think like they used the microscope because they they say in the in the meeting that they can't see the water unless they look through my school so i thought like that's how they discuss "
9591,210.3,Chris,,"Chris. Did you notice how anything that you could be more specific and your answer. ","well i i went to nasa with my dad and i know that um you know scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks asks and so i guess like should i should i add that to my answer "
9595,420.2,,,"that is when you would want to look back into the text to find your answer because you already know they use various tools like you said a mask ","So is the tool. I guess I'm wondering, like, is it like we're still or it sounds like the other one that just was still "
9601,510.1,Oliver,,"so that is why it's very important to highlight those keywords so you can give the best answer ","um yeah unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and i especially want to do that like that thank you for helping us really focus on the word discover and like really focusing on like how important that word is and like also like you really encouraged us to use evidence from the text and like make sure that we were on that like we were looking at the text for what we were saying um i really appreciate that was really fun working with so thank you so much "
9603,510.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just thinking and i wanted to share that basically like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't really think i need to be in this class i don't need any help "
9609,110.3,Luis,,"for me response you do know quite a lot so maybe you can actually help me teach the other students here ","know to do that yeah "
9613,230.1,Oliver,,"so i saw responses and student my question for you just you said that you sort of the same thing is student so can you explain how you also got the same answer for me ","um yeah so basically what i was thinking about was that um you know like that the microscope was was the tool and the reason why i thought that and i think it's like pretty pretty important is like so like is it's in the text because it says like you know we use a microscope or you couldn't see the water "
9619,120.3,Jazmin,,"but how about first we go back to the question itself oh yes student ","well i was just when you say i wasn't sure why why my answer was bob do you mean like i just wasn't quite sure "
9629,120.1,Farrah,,"what did you get out of the question ","i underlined it "
9636,210.4,,,"what does that mean that the water is microscopic ","um it's like really small "
9638,210.4,Oliver,,"yes and so from the passage student what do you need to see the water ","and you need a microscope to see the water "
9646,120.4,Chris,,"what equipment or do you see mentioned in there ","and i see and i guess like well okay so i that's a question i have and i think that student had the same question yeah i was wondering like that okay so here's what i thought like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and suits and stuff like that like luis's answer so i was thinking that like i'm wondering why that wasn't the answer "
9653,120.4,Jazmin,,"jimmy do you want to repeat that for me what your response was to the question ","yeah i was this i said yes nasa sent a small machine "
9655,210.4,Jazmin,,"and what was that small machine called ","yeah it was just or big "
9663,210.4,Luis,,"and student why was the lunar orbiter sent to the moon ","the next class has to come in but i just wanted to thank you so much for being with us before we have to be to thank you so much for everything um yeah i just wanted to remind class that my dad is actually an astronaut i just wanted class didn't know that "
9666,110.3,Luis,,"hopefully one day kevin unless i'm tell us a little bit about his experience there as well ","yeah "
9673,230.2,Luis,,"so from the passage itself because you had mentioned oxygen tanks and and other things from the passage what were some specific pieces of equipment that you see in the passage ","oh so like i gotta do like from not my like knowledge but like from the passage um well yeah i saw you that i knew were kind of cool like i saw that i'm like there was the lunar orbiter which is a really cool spacecraft and then there was also like a talked about microscopes but i don't think microscopes are the answer "
9676,230.1,Luis,,"what do you say that ","um yeah well actually it's a really good question i think that why like here's my thinking on this like i think that they asking the question they're like what equipment it scientists use discover water on the moon and i'm thinking well maybe they studied the water with the microscope but they discovered it right with the learner or so that's what i was thinking like as we as we look "
9682,210.4,Oliver,,"how was the water described in the passage ","um so they said the water was like they said microscopic which is crazy small "
9684,230.3,Chris,,"yeah and so so we know the water the water is there right i mean student you even said yourself that they found craters full of water on the moon ","yeah "
9686,210.3,Chris,,"yeah so i guess student also soften your answer so if the water is microscopic student can we just see it from let's say a lunar orbiter above the above the moon or do we have to see it with a special kind of equipment ","well i guess i'm not sure like which equipment exactly because you could do a scanner or like something like that you know what i mean like i'm assuming they're like probes stuff like that so maybe you didn't need the microscope i'm not sure "
9694,120.3,Jazmin,,"would you be okay to read the final sentence there oh yes yes student ","i will i will just be about like i was wondering if this was maybe the answer is nasa use a small machine to get to the water this is that a good answer Like you have to say what it is, so that not just small machine, you have to say they like to say like what equipment so like the lunar orbiter like nasa use the lunar orbiter to get to the one "
9701,120.3,Chris,,"what's that say ","so in part three it says which part that means the moon is still drier than the dry desert on earth "
9704,120.3,Chris,,"yeah the one starts with that the final sentence there my apologies oh ","gotcha you need a scientific microscope to look really close "
9708,210.4,Chris,,"so according to that passage student what is the passage saying that scientists had to use to see the water ","oh well i guess like the passage is saying like you have to use the microscope i guess is that right "
9715,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah i'm so sorry but unfortunately that's the end of our time but before we go we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular we really wanted to thank you are like making sure that we use like the stuff from the text and we didn't just make up like our own thoughts on what was happening and you also really helped us to clarify like you asked us a couple times like what we were thinking and it was really interesting to like think about like why did we come to dance you know and then when you did that it really helped us to understand like okay like that's what you're looking for us to teach this and there's like you know what i mean like it's hard to know like what the teacher wants us to do and i feel like it was really clear so thank you so much "
9717,210.4,All,,,"bye "
9719,210.4,Bennett,,,"um well my my answer came from the same from paragraph three where i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look closely "
9721,210.4,Luis,,,"excuse me "
9724,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm sorry i shouldn't be in this class i know a lot about space "
9726,220.1,Luis,,"we're all going to be in the class to learn together and discuss what we read ","okay "
9729,230.2,Farrah,,"student they used the microscope to look closely at it but what did they send to the moon ","um a space shuttle "
9731,120.3,Farrah,,"can you look back in the text and see ","reads text to herself quickly nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
9735,120.2,Chris,,"so student they you what did they use to find the water on the moon in the craters ","what student said "
9737,120.2,Chris,,,"oh whoa whoa to find the water the craters i figured they use their eyes cuz it said there was a lot of water there "
9744,120.3,Jazmin,,"so let's look back and can you reread paragraph three for me ","yeah but my answer is in paragraph one it's not in paragraph three Okay. okay reads paragraph three to himself in a whisper okay but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
9747,220.1,Jazmin,,"we're just having a class discussion now that we've read ","oh oh okay "
9749,210.3,Chris,,"so student after after reading paragraph three do you think that they were able to see the water with their eyes ","rereads to himself oh no it says the water they found was microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you're looking straight at it oh okay "
9752,130.2,Chris,,"so student your answer was that nasa send a small machine so student do you think that they use that machine to look at it because we couldn't see with our eyes ","the machine the microscope "
9754,130.2,Chris,,,"well yeah i think i think if it if you can see with your eyes and then chapter three or the part three yeah that's you got to you got to use a microscope "
9757,230.2,Luis,,"student you said that the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen and tanks what are they using that for ","they use that to breathe because you can't breathe in space because there isn't any oxygen there "
9760,120.1,Luis,,"what did you use to discover the water on the moon though ","um is it the microscope i'm not sure "
9765,120.3,Luis,,"can you read paragraph two for me ","okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits ina large polar crater ah oh yeah so that's what's going to find the water in the craters you know i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suit and stuff ok the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposit in the polar craters "
9771,130.3,Oliver,,"but however they use the small machine to find the ice deposits correct ","yeah yeah well i guess i mean i hear what they're saying but i guess i don't know why i don't know how how we got this answer about the small machine to find the ice deposits i was looking for the keywords and the question "
9778,120.2,Oliver,,"so the question is what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter investigate this is the one that student just read right that's lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small scientists think about one ton of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold on total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one person might drink in a day I thought it was equipment and discovering water. "
9784,120.4,Oliver,,"exactly very good so what equipment did they use to discover the water ","well i mean i guess i guess they use the lunar orbiter to go to the south pole and then they found more water on once they got to the south pole so um yeah i guess that that will be it oh i'm looking at the clock and it that it's time for us to go to lunch i know we just met um and it was a really short time but i do really appreciate how you you you kept asking us questions and asking us to read back the paragraphs to to help to help us understand the text "
9786,120.4,Oliver,,,"thank you okay okay bye class say bye bye "
9790,120.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like i don't think i even need to be in this class because i already know like all about space already "
9792,150.1,Luis,,"well that's okay it doesn't hurt to learn a little more right ","yeah i guess so "
9794,150.1,Farrah,,,"we're doing well we're excited to work with you "
9800,210.3,Farrah,,"does class want to share what they circled ","yeah okay so what i circled in the question was i said let's see i said equipment and discover "
9802,210.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah so basically i circled the same thing as student "
9804,120.4,Oliver,,"what was that ","i said equipment and discover "
9808,120.4,Chris,,,"Yes, so for me I circle. let's see i circled scientists and water "
9812,210.2,Jazmin,,"i like that you circled water because that's the key point of that question we're trying to find out how they found the water on the moon very well done ","yes so basically i circled i kind of circled much the same thing i circled discover and equipment i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong "
9814,110.2,Jazmin,,"i didn't say it was wrong your answer isn't wrong ","oh okay "
9816,110.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so for me i circled on equipment and scientists "
9821,210.3,Farrah,,"okay student did you find anything that helps you to change your answer by circling the keyword in the question ","so i when i went to circle the keywords i basically ended up with the same answer and that's because i was thinking about what equipment was used to discover the water and i still think it's the microscope so i thought extra hard about it but i still have the same answer "
9824,110.1,Oliver,,"well done student ","um yeah basically the same as student and for me like i was thinking about science equipment and discover and so i also think that like it has to do especially with the microscope "
9827,130.1,Oliver,,"Yes, I know what you mean. They use the microscope to look closely at the water. ","um yeah i could try to see like i'm not quite sure "
9831,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class know ","yeah i was gonna say they use the small machine to get to the moon and they use the small machine to find the water "
9834,210.4,Chris,,"can class go back into the text and find out what the name of that small machine was called ","oh well i was just gonna say that okay so i went to nasa with my dad and when he and i went to nasa together we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks so i was kind of wondering about that "
9837,230.1,Chris,,"wondering about that in what way ","well like it wasn't in the in the meeting but i was thinking like they had to use it you know so like i was thinking maybe that's the answer with the equipment "
9840,130.1,Jazmin,,"They did have to use that equipment, while they were in the on the moon and stuff like that. ","so i was gonna say us with the machine was and i was gonna say the machine is the lunar orbiter "
9843,230.2,Jazmin,,"very good i'm so how did you find that answer did you look back in the text using your keywords ","yeah because you said look for this specific machine and so when i went back and look for the specific machine that was the equipment itself lunar orbiter and unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go to our next class i just wanted to thank you for working with us it's really fun to work with so thank you so much "
9846,230.2,Jazmin,,,"we're doing good "
9848,230.2,Luis,,,"up yeah i was just excited i wanted to tell class make sure class knew that actually my dad is an astronaut "
9850,110.1,Luis,,"is he really we'll have to talk to him after school about all this stuff that you're learning about ","oh yeah i totally well "
9855,120.4,Farrah,,"student what was your answer ","ok so my answer was basically no like i don't think it's very convincing but not for a long time "
9862,230.2,Oliver,,"okay student where did you find in the text to support your answer ","okay so i had basically i said that know that it's not ready yet and i was looking in paragraph it's paragraph under the water is a valuable resource and it basically was saying that like in paragraph six it says like um that scientists need to come up with a plan for getting the water and then making this plan will take a lot of time and money and i guess i was just thinking that like basically it's not ready yet to get the water from them like you'd have to do a lot of other stuff to get the water "
9867,310.1,Jazmin,,"yes that is true i like that you went back in the text and had some support to support your answer and i do agree with you ","yes okay see i said that yes that the water would be valuable and the reason that i said that so astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and so what i was looking at basically i wasn't a paragraph four and they were saying that basically the astronauts could read the water you know what i mean and also was gonna say like something that i thought was really cool is that you could use the water and you could grow a garden and you can have all these plants and things like that with the water that's up there "
9870,110.1,Luis,,"that's a great idea i wonder if that could happen we'll have to do some more research about that another time student ","um yeah okay so for me basically what i said i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and the part where i got that from was let's see where did i oh oh okay in paragraph five purify water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket "
9878,230.3,Chris,,"so the water can be used for two different things for the astronauts to drink and as the fuel if they break it into two parts so that was two of the ways that they could use it ","oh i was just going to share my answer okay so water is heavy so it's good they don't you know have to carry it in the ships anymore and i think for me like where i i saw it like what is it it says in paragraph or the waters happy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft and that would be a big deal to have that and then i also said like student water can be broken down into two parts into hydrogen and also into oxygen and you can use both of those things Thank you. "
9881,210.3,Farrah,,"student did you student and student were you able to find in the in the paragraph where they were talking about the air answers and why it is a yes ","yeah we saw the answers i think that well do you have any thoughts um yeah i mean basically my thinking is that it's not that it will be useful like in the future but i think there's just so many problems on the way costs too much money and like we don't right now like how much like to do in space like i don't know i guess i'm still kind of wondering you know what i mean "
9889,130.3,Jazmin,,"and based off the paragraphs as student said we're able to see that they can use the water for two different reasons ","Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. But before we go to lunch. I just wanted to thank you for working with us and, like, in particular. i wanted to really thank you for like taking the time to make sure that we were circling keywords and making sure that we were like using our keywords you know me and like you're even more than that that we were like that we were using evidence like that's a really big deal because sometimes we don't always like base our answers on the text that you really like wanted to make sure that we were using evidence so i think class went back and and like really closely with you'd like everything they needed to do you know we take the quiz this was really cool so like thank you so much for working with us and it was really cool that just like you were really made us feel valued and i guess thank you so much "
9893,150.1,Luis,,"alright friends thank you for sharing your answers with me about what equipment did scientists use from our text so now i want to dig a little bit deeper into your answers okay ","um yeah so i was just gonna say i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
9896,120.2,Farrah,,"okay alright so thank you again for sharing all your answers okay so our question said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon okay do you have the text in front of you ","yes we do "
9900,420.3,Oliver,,"i want you to think about what equipment was used and if you see any equipment mentioned if you can use your pencil and underline it okay so i'm going to give you a few seconds to do that ","paragraph five is that the one from the second reading about waters of valuable resource "
9903,420.3,Oliver,,,"gotcha just wanted to check "
9908,420.3,Chris,,,"um okay so i underlined um let's see machine lunar orbiter i guess glasses but i don't think they mean it that way those things "
9911,110.1,Farrah,,"awesome job thank you for sharing all right miss student what did you underline and paragraph two ","i said the same thing like small machine and lunar orbit just in paragraph two i'm still confused like why are my answers wrong "
9914,110.2,Luis,,"okay well we're going to get to that in one second all right student and it's not wrong we're just going to see if there was a different way to answer it okay all right student can you share what you underlined in paragraph two ","um yeah so imperative to well i underline the same thing like small machine i underlined lunar orbiter because i figured that was something that you know that's that's i know about that crap um yeah that's what i put but i also like wrote down like some other stuff because there's lots of other equipment that they used "
9918,230.2,Farrah,,"okay and so student why did you underline that in paragraph two ","it was the only equipment in paragraph two "
9920,230.2,Oliver,,"okay student why did you underline that i'm paragraph two ","um yeah basically that was on the same because it was all the equipment that i could see "
9923,120.1,Farrah,,"good okay so does that help us answer our question of what equipment was used to find water on the moon ","still confused because i i i guess why the microscope is it you know what i mean is it an answer too because it says what equipment is used to discover water like they said that you have to use the microscope to see so how did they discover what if they couldn't see "
9925,130.1,Farrah,,"well that's very good so the microscope would be part of the answer and lunar orbiter would also be part of the answer right student ","okay yeah so so microscope and lunar orbiter "
9930,230.1,Farrah,,"Hello. So I saw your responses to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. Um, Farrah, how did you come up with your answer. ","okay so i got my answer from paragraph three and i basically was thinking like you have to use the microscope to see the water if you were going to like discover it how could you discover it without without seeing "
9934,230.2,Luis,,"student where did you come up with your answer ","ah yeah okay so i got my answer from like i know about like space and stuff so i already kind of knew the answer to this question i don't think i really need to be in this class because i don't really need help with this stuff you know "
9938,220.1,Chris,,"okay well we're all put in this class to help each other learn um ","um well i mean i guess i don't i don't know i don't really have anything to say about it like i think it was like i think in the in the in the text it talks about like how the craters have a bunch of water um and like that made me think like that's you know what i mean like that was what they had to find "
9940,210.3,Chris,,"do you think that your answer answers the question student ","i'm not sure "
9942,120.2,Chris,,"let's read the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh okay yeah i guess not "
9945,120.1,Chris,,"okay do you have another answer at this time do you think ","um yeah okay so i actually was kind of agreeing with student like my dad took me to nasa and we went like all over the place and like looked at different stuff and like saw that like astronauts had to have like um like boots and oxygen tanks and all the stuff you know what i mean like they needed all that stuff to go up into space so i guess like i kind of thought maybe that was missing "
9949,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay student do you have anything to add to what student said ","well i guess well i guess what i thought was that it was this small machine that they sent was how they discovered the water i'm not really sure about chris's answer but um like student and oliver's like is my answer wrong was it not the small machine that discovered the water "
9954,210.3,Oliver,,"so student do you think there's another part to your answer other than the small microscope ","um yeah i guess actually okay so when when we talk about it together like i guess you need the lunar orbiter but um i guess it kind of still think it's like i kind of still think it's the it's the microscope because like student was saying like you have to see the water to know that it's there so like maybe the microscope was on the lunar orbiter "
9959,130.2,Farrah,,"does class agree or disagree with student ","um yeah okay so i agree i think that um like i think that that probably that's true that like the microscope was maybe attached to the lunar orbiter or something cuz they had to discover the water but they say that the water is um that it's basically like they like to use the word microscopic like it's so small that you can't even see it "
9963,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay student what do you think do you agree with student and student ","well i guess i'm not totally sure i mean i guess maybe maybe that's the case like maybe the lunar orbiter could have like a microscope attached i think that could be possible "
9967,120.4,Luis,,"okay um student what are you thinking ","well i guess like i'm kind of thinking i don't know like i mean i guess yeah i see that they could probably use the the lunar orbiter to go up there um i guess it's not really it doesn't really say if they're astronauts are not like if they're astronauts up there then that would be one thing but i don't really think there are "
9972,230.1,Chris,,"student what are you thinking ","um so like i'm kind of just i'm kind of thinking i mean i guess i'm kind of thinking that if it was a like an unmanned craft like like a like a probe that they sent up with the lunar orbiter was like didn't have any astronauts then then i guess they don't need the the gloves and the stuff so yeah they could use the microscope like on the orbiter and like control it with a computer or a robot "
9981,120.4,Oliver,,"mm hmm and then what did we use to go back and find our answer ","um i'm not quite sure what wait when you say what did we use like what did we use in class Um, well, actually, um, I would say that what seemed to help us find our answer was all like listening to each other. um and actually we have to we have to actually go to lunch but before we go i did want to thank you for that specifically because i think that we all did like have a chance like to work with each other and to like really like listen to each other carefully and closely and really hear what we were saying to each other so that was pretty cool and i really really appreciate that you did that because we don't always get to listen to each other and kind of learn from each other's like thinking so thank you so much "
9984,230.1,Farrah,,"okay i'm going to start with student student you said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to really look closely what made you say a microscope student ","so i was thinking about like what equipment like i know about microscopes from like science class and so i was thinking like you know if you want to see like the water and it's really small that you could only find it with a microscope you know what i mean "
9986,110.1,Luis,,"yeah yes i can see are you can you say that yes student do you have a question ","um wow it's kind of more of a statement um i think i should be in this class because i know like all this stuff about space like i practically know everything about space "
9991,230.1,Luis,,"so could you tell me what made you say the oxygen tanks ","um yeah yeah so i was seeking about oxygen tanks because like well okay so i was seeing whenever i see like movies with astronauts or whenever i think about like like watching a moon launch or whatever i think like the astronauts would have to have you know what i mean like if they were going up into space you have to have that "
9995,110.1,Jazmin,,"mm hmm yes that's correct i could see how you could come up with that answer ","okay so when i look and small machine she basically i was looking in paragraph two and i was in the first sentence it seemed like that's what they sent they sent a small machine to go look at the water so that's why "
9999,230.1,Chris,,"student let's look at yours you said a scientist found craters full of water on the moon could you explain a little bit more to me about how you came up with that answer ","i was thinking that when they were saying in the reading like they were saying okay so there's ice deposits in the polar crater and i was thinking that like ice is is basically frozen water and i like i kind of know that i'm from science class and um it made me think like well that's where the water it you know "
10003,230.1,Oliver,,"student let's look at yours that you told me that you circled the same as student so could you explain to me where you come up with your answer ","um yeah so what i was thinking was when i was looking through the reading i was seeing like so in the in the question in the question it says what equipment did scientists use and it made me think like look for equipment so then i went i looked for equipment i saw microscopes and i totally know about microscopes "
10005,110.1,Farrah,,"okay fair enough student you have a question ","um yeah i guess i'm still wondering like cuz you know we're in the small class to try to help our answers like i guess i'm wondering like why my answer's wrong "
10015,120.3,Chris,,"or the south pole and look for ask deposits in a large polar crater vast deposits are very small ","um yeah so i guess my my question was so like i went to nasa with my dad and i guess kind of like what he was saying like you know like scientists use all this other equipment like oxygen tanks and mass and suits i guess i was wondering like on the lunar orbiter like why that ones the answer and not like other "
10023,210.4,Oliver,,"to be able to see it because those deposits were so small you couldn't see it with your naked eye you needed the microscope to be able to really zoom in and see it so they did use other pieces of equipment to help them but the one that helped them find it and investigate it was the lunar orbiter ","thank you so much for working with us it's time for the next class so we have to go "
10026,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay so student you said nasa sent a small machine you know the name of that machine they sent ","i think but i think student has his hand up should you call on him first or i guess student "
10028,210.4,Jazmin,,"why don't you look back at the text and paragraph two and can you tell me the name of the machine that nasa sent ","okay let's see so paragraph two the name of small machine was the lunar orbiter "
10030,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah it's kind of more of like a comment i guess than anything like i don't think i need to be in this class like i know all about space already and like i feel like i kind of know all this stuff so i don't really need any help "
10034,210.4,Luis,,"however student do you see in paragraph two where it talks about the machine that they sent ","um yeah i guess so i guess so i guess i just like i kind of know all this stuff you know "
10038,150.1,Luis,,"Luis are you looking at, paragraph two, there ","um yeah i'm looking right now did you want me to give the answer "
10041,150.1,Luis,,,"okay um i guess in paragraph two um let's see i guess it could be the lunar orbiter "
10047,430.3,Chris,,"i just want to make sure we understand can you look at paragraph three and see if they found craters that were full of water or maybe not so full water can you go ahead and look there and give me a response ","okay um the water they found is the water the found is microscopic like so i guess so was the water like are they talking about the water molecules are like the water i'm kind of confused "
10050,120.3,Chris,,"so the water they found is microscopic and it says meaning that you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it ","microscopic's kind of like really small "
10053,210.4,Chris,,"so the water they found was microscopic you couldn't really see if you're looking straight at it so it was really small there's a small amount of it so the scientists would need a microscope to look at it very closely ","so like a small amount of water "
10056,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","oh "
10058,150.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i have a question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer might might not be right like in terms of the question "
10062,130.3,Farrah,,"the small machine that they sent was caught a lunar orbiter and that was to help them investigate ","gotcha so did they discover it with the microscope "
10064,130.3,Farrah,,"what does it just says that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look at it really closely it doesn't tell us that they did use the microscope ","okay so you just needed to see "
10066,210.4,Farrah,,"if they were going to really and truly look at it and try to see it then they would need the microscope to look at it because it is such a small amount ","okay "
10068,210.4,Chris,,,"um yeah okay so um i was just went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so did they use that stuff to find to discover the water "
10070,130.3,Chris,,"well again it says that nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate so i do not believe that they sent any astronauts up there to look at it at this time that they just as they sent their small machine ","gotcha okay so so was like like they may be need that stuff but they didn't like use it necessarily this time "
10072,110.4,Chris,,"right ","okay okay "
10075,120.4,Oliver,,"student you said that you circled the same as student so can you tell me what equipment the scientists use to discover the water on the moon ","um yeah so it looks like um student and i circled at the beginning we circled the microscope because that seemed like the equipment that was probably used to see the water that was so small but um i'm guessing that they probably used other stuff as well it sounds like they they used this on the lunar orbiter to go also and like discover the water "
10078,210.4,Oliver,,"so they did send the lunar orbiter up to investigate and then if they were to really look at the water very closely they would need the microscope ","so um we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go i just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us today and also to really thank you for like getting us to try to listen to each other's opinions and also really listening to our responses and to making sure that each of us had time to work with you today that was a big deal that we each had time to have a chance to work with you thank you so much "
10082,210.4,Luis,,,"yeah okay so here's the thing i kind of know all about space so i don't really know like i don't think i have to be in this class i don't really need any help "
10089,120.3,Farrah,,"all right student let's have you read the first paragraph right where it says one ","okay um let's see the moon is a desert scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
10092,120.3,Oliver,,"student saw your hand first let's go with you ","um okay um second paragraph and number two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
10097,120.3,Farrah,,"hi student i saw your hand first let's go ","so let's see paragraph three that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific to call the microscope to look really closely Yes. So, okay. I was just wondering, as we were reading it through like because I know we're in this group for for help. Like, I was wondering why my answer about the microscope might not be right or what was wrong. "
10101,120.4,Jazmin,,"Alright, Jazmin, I see your hand. What did you find? ","basically i wasn't quite sure about microscopic i think i know what it means but i wasn't totally sure "
10103,230.1,Jazmin,,"what do you believe it means ","it means something that is small "
10106,130.1,Jazmin,,"yes small but it's actually smaller than small microscopic is a really big word that means very very small small enough to where we can't actually see it without a special tool ","It's the microscope. That was Farrah's answer. "
10111,120.4,Chris,,"yes does class else yes student what did you find ","you yeah i didn't actually so i didn't really see anything in here but i kind of i did have a question that came up from reading and it was like i went to nasa with my dad and there was like like we we saw all these spacesuits and like oxygen tanks and all the stuff that the astronauts had to use like did they not have to did they not need those things is that whether or not in the reading "
10117,120.4,Farrah,,"class have any ideas ","okay so to me i thought that um well i think it's to paragraph three because they're talking about the water that they found and they're talking about how you'd be able to see it like how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it "
10122,130.2,Jazmin,,"well we are absolutely on the right track student what do you have to add ","okay so like i don't really think that it's the microscope i think that it's the machine the lunar orbiter and the reason that i think that is that it it talks about like using that to investigate and that sounds like the like the thing that the question like discover what it does "
10132,130.3,Jazmin,,"I don't really think they could have. It's that small, I don't think really we could see it with that that special tool that scientists created for us to actually use. So now what I want you to do, you guys know what elbow partners are? ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really like helping us kind of work together as a class and really focusing on like having us explorer answers together as a class and like not sort of just like giving us the answers like sometimes teachers just kind of give us the answer and we don't really we don't really think about like what we're supposed to be thinking about and we did a lot of thinking today i just wanted to thank you because that was pretty cool "
10135,130.3,Farrah,,,"we're excited to work with you "
10145,150.1,Farrah,,"if you don't come to the correct conclusion on the first trouble work together does that make sense ","oh yeah that sounds great and i think that we all feel really confident now that you said that thank you so much alright "
10148,120.2,Luis,,"so i'm going to reread the question for all of us so that we can hear it again the question is what equipment did scientists ","oh no that's okay i was more of a comment really i was just gonna say like i don't think i have to be on this class cuz like i kind of already know all about space "
10150,110.3,Luis,,"so you're very enthusiastic about space you enjoy it ","yeah "
10155,120.2,Farrah,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","sure no problem ok so my answer was you need to see typical color microscope to look really close "
10159,230.2,Farrah,,"student have you found it ","yeah i have a good idea "
10162,230.2,Farrah,,"to go ahead and read me where it is in the passage ","good okay so when i look at the reading the thing that connected was a paragraph and it says the water they found is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope really close "
10164,210.4,Farrah,,"exactly microscopic that's one of the words that pops out to me what does that mean student do you know ","it means really small "
10170,110.1,Oliver,,"let's move on let's move on to the name is tiny student i believe i'm reading your name right is that right ","yeah that's right my name is student "
10172,110.1,Farrah,,"absolutely not see you said you circled the same thign as student ","go ahead i was just gonna student and i have the same answer i think that we were still little bit about why he was wrong "
10182,150.1,Jazmin,,"is the answer in there or is that just a partial answer in there what do you class believe what do you think student and student ","so when i was looking i realized that i think the answer is the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer to me "
10189,110.2,Oliver,,"so in essence kind of both of them are correct ","um so i think that i understand that the equipment like the answer to the question is the lunar orbiter but i think i'm still not quite sure why and i'm unfortunately we have to go to our next class but thank you so much for working with us we really enjoyed working with thank you "
10192,110.1,Chris,,"allright class just to recap for my own sake i believe we went over student and student and student you hopped back in believe student you just had a question student hold on just one moment ","yeah so i was just say um let's see i think it was talking about like the before lunch i was talking about like craters well so my answer was that the craters were full of water on the moon and that that was like you know what i mean like they found all this water "
10197,110.1,Chris,,"so let's go back student put your hand up for just a minute we'll get to you in just a moment your next up ","okay so when i was reading i thought that okay so one of the keywords in the question was what so i said okay so you have to find quiet and you both do the bidding and then when i was looking at the meeting i saw that there was all this water that it was mostly located in the craters so i thought yeah that's where they'll find it "
10201,230.2,Chris,,"Sure, if I were to so do me a favor, which paragraph. Did you find the information about the crater. ","um let's paragraph one "
10205,120.3,Chris,,"yeah i see i see in the last minute so would you mind student would you mind reading paragraphs one and two for the class please ","yeah okay scientists have known for a long time that the moon is it desert because it has no opposite like we have however a usable that there was no water on and we can imagine that i read the rest it so you have plenty of time yeah "
10213,120.3,Chris,,"I'm going to read that for all of us, scientists said that one time of the top layer of the moon's surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water. And if we continue that's that's only about four glasses of water ","um no i guess it's not "
10216,210.3,Chris,,"is that completely accurate ","no because they're not as there's just a little bit of water like not a lot of water "
10223,150.1,Luis,,"we just need to take it a little bit further ","yeah i i think i've got this all figured out so i think i'm good i was just gonna say i think i can go back to my seat "
10234,230.2,Jazmin,,"so would you mind going back in the text and finding that for me while you're looking ","i was just gonna say that i was still a little bit confused about some of the stuff like i think they understand like so in this being the right answer and i understand that like the nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to discover the water like that that seems like the right answer right so i understand that but i think what i was confused by was that there were like i guess i'm wondering like why like why that was the right answer and like student and oliver's the answer was like about the microscope like is the or even like this stuff about like the spacesuits and the masks that is it just the lunar orbiter part of the answer or should you answer like with all the thing "
10242,210.2,Jazmin,,"however if we read the question itself specifically what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon that's our buzzword right there discover the water ","Makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So does that make sense in that makes sense to me but like i think that yeah okay so it's the orbiter was like that thing actually found the water and then they studied the water later but first you have to find is that right "
10247,110.1,Luis,,"student let's move back over here real quick before we hop over to student i see your hand you can put it down ","so i think it was a trick question because i did not find it and i think that was the thing right like it wasn't there i think i just brought that in from outside you know what i mean like it wasn't in the text there was nothing about like face masks and stuff like that like i think pretty much like i got that from like what i already know yeah "
10259,430.3,Farrah,,"but not necessarily applicable to this specific text so maybe in the future use that information but just make sure that you take it maybe a little bit slower find all the information there and and then apply that ","i'm sure thing so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us to really make sure that we were using evidence from the text in our answers and you really asked us like about our thinking and you really like had us kind of like prove what we were saying by also like explaining what we were thinking and let us take time you like really let us take time to explain our ideas like sometimes we interrupt each other but like you're really made sure that class was listened to and like i think class thought really value and like finally you really explain what we needed to work and you gave us ideas about what what we needed to do to like improve our answers so i think like every single one of us even if we're not like totally on the answer or totally understanding class knows like what we need to work on to get to the right answer and like that's really cool because that doesn't happen all the time so just wanted to say thank you bye bye hi how are you today "
10261,430.3,Farrah,,,"we're doing well "
10263,430.3,Luis,,,"oh um so i have a question i have a question "
10265,430.3,Luis,,,"yeah okay so i already know like all about space so like i don't really think i need any help i don't think i need to be in this class "
10267,110.3,Luis,,"well i definitely think it would help if you stuck around and maybe you can help encourage your classmates to learn a little bit more and even learn a little more yourself ","okay yeah i can do that "
10271,150.1,Oliver,,"okay does class else have any questions so far ","um yeah i have a quick question um so we were we were just discussing the text and looking at the question how did scientists or what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and we each had our answers um what would you like us to do do you want us to keep discussing our answers um what would you like "
10273,130.2,Oliver,,"okay so i think right now what we can do is discuss with your neighbor or even the class and kind of talk about where you class got your answers from and what you'd like to know more about ","okay we can do that "
10275,130.2,Farrah,,,"okay so my my question was when i was looking at the text again and we were when we were talking about it um i still think my answer is right like i think that my answer about the microscope is right so i really don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10277,420.2,Farrah,,"we just want to dig a little bit deeper into the text and maybe help your fellow students figure out some more details about what nasa did to find water on the moon ","okay "
10281,120.4,Jazmin,,"go ahead ","who would you like to go it's student and then student have their hand raised "
10284,120.4,Jazmin,,"um student go ahead ","okay so basically what what we were discussing we didn't agree but i thought that the answer was the small machine which when i was looking was saying that was a was the lunar orbiter um yeah was the lunar orbiter and so with the small machine i think that's what they used to discover the one and that's the answer but i think that student and student thought something else "
10287,130.2,Chris,,"okay well let's see what student and student thought as well ","okay so i'm like here's the thing i basically like my dad took me to nasa and when we went to nasa we went and saw like all of this like um like all of these like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that like student was talking about so like i was just thinking like i think that's missing from the text like i think that's important to have those things you know like how could they go up there without oxygen tanks they had to use that to discover the water "
10293,120.4,Oliver,,"student you have a question ","oh yeah um well actually at the end maybe i'm thinking a little differently um like i was thinking so you'll have to use all the things to discover the water is that the idea "
10297,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah so in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and basically look for these ice deposits and since the water was so small we then have to use a microscope to see it ","okay gotcha um well we have to go to lunch unfortunately but before we go her just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i wanted to thank you for being so patient with each of our answers and for making sure that you were able to listen to each of our answers because sometimes we don't always each like get called on in class and it's really nice that we each had a chance to talk this time so thank you so much for working with us "
10300,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i kind of know like all this stuff about space so i don't think i need to be in this class "
10303,110.3,Luis,,"and maybe if you do understand everything you can help out some of your classmates ","yeah i could do that that sounds cool "
10309,420.3,Farrah,,"and while each of you had really good thought processes i want you to take another look at the article and i want you to either underline or circle words that are similar to the question or words that you think would be really important ","okay so in in the text i picked out the word microscope microscopic and let's see what else yeah microscope and microscopic "
10311,230.1,Farrah,,"okay great so what made you choose those two words ","um well i chose them because i think that that's the equipment that the scientists you use and i think that that tells us why it's the equipment because it says that the waters microscopic and then you can't see it without the microscope so i'm thinking like you know you can't find it if you can't see it "
10313,130.2,Jazmin,,"okay that's a really good thought student i want to hear from your classmates and then we're going to come back together and see what class thinks about your key terms okay student would you like to go next ","i was trying to figure out why my answer was wrong and when i looked at it so the word that i circled i circled keywords in the question i circled equipment and then discover then i looked at the text i also circled in paragraph two investigate "
10317,230.3,Luis,,"okay that's a good job student so it looks like so far student and student you class have both talked about equipment ","yeah yeah yeah absolutely i always like to talk so i basically um yeah so what i was looking at when i was looking at the reading was i basically was saying like i said equipment too and then i said like what else did i put on yeah but i basically circled equipment and that was it "
10321,210.2,Chris,,"student you also said that discover and investigate were really similar so maybe we can use a combination of equipment and see what equipment helped us discover water ","Yeah I okay so I went to NASA with like that. And when we were there. We saw that scientists like use oxygen masks and two and things like that. So I was wondering, like, is that part of you know what I mean is that part of how they found the found the water? "
10326,420.2,Farrah,,"i want you to help each other understand the text and so now that we know the keywords that class thinks i want you class to reconstruct your answer to give us a little bit more detail about the equipment that specifically helped us discover water ","so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you "
10329,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i kind of i think i got this all figured out so um yeah i think i'm all good "
10337,120.4,Oliver,,"student would you like to share first ","um yeah so i was thinking when you said like more detailed like that we need to use like a complete sentence and like like draw from the from the text right like from the things that we circled or underlined and like say this is why i think that's right so if i was gonna say my answer like i guess well i guess can i still say microscope or i guess it's the lunar orbiter isn't "
10339,310.1,Oliver,,"And now that you've chosen to answer that gives us more detail, instead of just circling the same as Farrah. Your thought process is a lot deeper as well. ","yeah i'm trying to think like how to explain it in my own words you know "
10342,130.2,Chris,,"sure well i know that a couple of you class had your hand raised but student would you like to share how your it's your may have been reconstructed and maybe that will help student with his words since you class may have similar answers ","i wasn't really answering the question so i ok so my answer now would be like that scientists are found craters full of water on the moon by using the lunar orbiter "
10345,120.4,Jazmin,,"Let's hear from your partner Jazmin and see what she has to say. ","okay so basically the first thing i was gonna say is that i'm still a little bit confused and i think what i'm confused about is how like how we can make sure that our answers are complete i think i understand what student did but i'm not quite sure how to make my answer more complete i said nasa sent a small machine then i could add lunar orbiter but i'm not sure how to do more than that "
10349,420.2,Jazmin,,"one thing that may help you in the future is to answer the question as if you were teaching about the question so if somebody was new to reading this passage just like you class were how would you best explain it to them so that they would get a full picture of what you class are reading ","oh that's really interesting i just want to make sure that they they answered the question so that whatever they said like i would want to make sure that it was like it answered the question about equipment and discovering water "
10352,420.2,Oliver,,"sure so you can also remind them if you were teaching or even from your perspective as a student if you can answer the question and then give us a little bit more detail as to why that your answer that will help you with a with a more concrete answer ","um so i was just gonna share and i thought this was kind of interesting based on what we're talking about that i read somewhere that there could possibly be a base on the moon like a settlement by by 2024 like that's what nasa was trying to do "
10358,120.4,Farrah,,"student would you like to go first ","yeah i don't think it's actually i guess i guess i don't really have a question because i understand why it's the lunar orbiter because it's not it didn't say those tricky in the in the reading it didn't say that they discovered it using the microscope they studied using a microscope so is that right is that the right way to look at it "
10368,120.4,Farrah,,"student would you like to add anything to that ","yeah we have to go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were using the words from the question like the word discover in what we were looking at and not just that but like you have this use evidence in our interests and you also like you asked us a lot about like you help us to clarify what we were trying to say because you asked us like why did we say this or what were we thinking even me and so i think we all really valued in a minute we all you know like like you really were listening to us and it was pretty cool and so thank you so much for coming and you also like beginning explain like what we needed to work on and like how we could improve our answer so i think we learned a lot thank you so much how are you doing "
10370,120.4,Luis,,,"i have a question i already know like all this stuff about space already um like i don't think i need to be in this class i don't really need any help "
10373,120.2,Farrah,,"and turning our attention to that question and you all have read what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","we can go one at a time and give you our answers again "
10377,120.2,Chris,,,"okay so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and yeah i circled the same thing as student um so scientists foudn craters full of water on the moon "
10384,110.1,Farrah,,"they said that scientists need a microscope to find water in the craters on the moon ","I agree. i think so I would say okay so in paragraph three it talks about how you need the microscope. You wouldn't be able to see the water without the microscope. "
10387,110.2,Farrah,,"good job student is exactly right you look at paragraph three you will in fact see that it says you need a microscope ","but i know that we're here in the class to sort of help with our answers but i am not really sure why my answer is wrong it seems it is the microscope "
10391,110.2,Oliver,,"in fact it is the microscope and part of the answers is right it is the microscope ","Um okay, so you have to look really closely because you can't see it with just your eye. You have to see it through the microscope. "
10393,210.4,Oliver,,"What is it about water. ","because it's so small like the the particles of water are so are so tiny "
10397,120.1,Jazmin,,"what other instruments do we we determined that we need an instrument called a microscope we know what the microscope does and why we need it is there any other equipment that we need ","yeah i think that we would need the small machine that they sent up into space and i think i guess i'm confused like why is my answer wrong "
10400,230.2,Jazmin,,"and go ahead and refer to the text and see if you can find textual evidence that supports the fact that they need a small machine ","well i guess what i'm trying to find it says that in paragraph two that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10406,110.4,Chris,,"exactly exactly so you're right they do need a small machine and ","yeah so i went to nasa with my dad and we saw like all like spacesuits and and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff that people had to use so i guess i'm kind of confused like did they not have to use those things like was that like did they not not need them "
10417,410.3,Oliver,,"but specifically this paragraph addresses just a small part of that process and that is actually investigating the craters on the moon so that is right student they do need a lot of equipment to get there you know a lot of equipment to land and they need equipment to examine the craters but this article that we have here is examining just one little part of that whole process ","um yeah so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to um i just wanted to thank you for a second for working with us today you were very patient with us and you were very positive the whole way through and we i think we really feel like you were very positive listening to our answers and talking to us today and it's really nice when a teacher listens so thank you so much "
10420,410.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say like um i think i have to be in this room because i already like all out space oh "
10424,120.4,Luis,,"what was your answer to that question ","so i said that scientists use a lot of it like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
10429,230.1,Luis,,"and what made you say that answer in relation to the question that was asked and the text that you read ","so i thought well in terms of the question i was thinking like what did they use to discover the water and i was like well i know that they use like they have to have oxygen tanks and they have to have that kind of stuff in order to breathe so i was like oh yeah okay so that was something that happened to us like even if it's in the reading or not i was like oh yeah well that's gotta be part of the answer "
10432,420.3,Luis,,"so student if you would right now go to the text and find some equipment that is specifically mentioned in the text and see if your answer is there if you see oxygen tanks mentioned and if you don't what is mentioned ","okay yeah i guess they don't really talk about like oxygen tanks they talk about lunar orbiter and microscopes "
10441,110.1,Farrah,,"and you said that they use the microscope so student i'd like to turn to you and student you keep on looking for that information i'll turn to student student ","so i was i'm still i'm still a little confused about why my answer is wrong but i can't tell you what i was thinking so basically when i looked at the text like i saw i think it's in paragraph three they were talking about how it's like microscope and he said you couldn't even see it unless you would look through the mircoscope so i was thinking like you know how did they find the microscope if they decide how could they find the water if they if they couldn't even see you know what i mean oh ok so the microscope has to be the answer "
10449,210.3,Farrah,,"were their scientists on the moon to use that microscope to see the water deposits ","interesting um i'm not sure i have to look at again okay so it looks like well i don't see anything about scientists so i'm guessing no so my question like how did they find it if they didn't use the microscope "
10460,420.3,Chris,,"So I want you to look for that Farrah look to see if there's a piece of equipment that was on the moon. ","yeah i was i was actually gonna say i'm thinking about what student was saying that like i went to nasa with my dad and we saw that like scientists use a lot of like masks at suits like student was saying and so i guess i was wondering like i guess that doesn't if i'm remembering from what you said to student it's not in the reading so it's not in the answer but it seems like that was an important thing to have thing to have like an even if it's not masters i guess i'm confused yeah "
10467,420.2,Chris,,"because we must always refer to the text ","no i didn't find equipment what i i was looking at was the water so i said that scientists breeders full of water "
10470,210.4,Oliver,,"so i would like you to do student is go back to the text what equipment does it say they sent into the craters to find that water that's on the moon ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us thank you "
10473,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i think that like i got everything pretty much figured out so i think i'm all good "
10476,150.1,Luis,,"okay and you did read the text right which was water is a valuable resource ","yeah i read it carefully this time "
10478,120.4,Luis,,"okay and you did answer the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable what was your answer to that question ","i said on water can be split into two parts oxygen and hydrogen "
10483,230.1,Luis,,"why does that make water valuable ","i was thinking looking at the meeting because i made sure to look this up and i said like they said i'm that like you can well you could do all the steps of oxygen can like astronauts can breathe it and like hydrogen and oxygen can be used to make rocket fuel you know what i mean like that would seem very valuable to me "
10487,420.2,Luis,,"so that second part that you just gave me that's why it's valuable so that's a great answer ","oh thank you "
10489,120.4,Jazmin,,"and student what was what was your answer to that question ","i said yes and i said the astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
10493,230.1,Jazmin,,"and why does that make it valuable what's your thinking there ","okay let's really see cuz i'm like i was still use like maybe why my answer wasn't quite right but actually that makes a lot of sense "
10497,110.2,Jazmin,,"i will say student and your answer is right ","What he said you could you could, but it's super heavy so it takes it takes up all this room like a rocket ship. exactly it seems like it would be really good to have it with your phone right beacuse then you wouldn't have to take as much with you "
10505,120.4,Chris,,"Chris what was your answer? ","OK, so my answer was that water is heavy. So it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships. "
10514,230.3,Chris,,"they don't have to put that water on the rocket ","as well so i read somewhere that they were maybe going to try to put in a moon base by 2020 or like some kind of base and i guess if that was true then like it would be really important to have like not only water but like the other stuff so like what he was saying like with the rocket fuel so i'm thinking like the oxygen and hydrogen on that you can make from water like that would be useful as well "
10520,120.4,Oliver,,"student what was your answer to that question ","so my answer was i said no because it's not ready yet "
10523,230.1,Oliver,,"okay and and what exactly do you mean when you say it's not ready yet ","like the water first off like the water is ice so you know what i mean like you'd have to make it into something that you could bring and then like they said in the writing they said like later on in it they talked about how that the it would take a lot of time and money to like make it happen and so i thought like you know like maybe someday it might be valuable but like it doesn't seem like it's very convincing right now that there's very good "
10532,210.3,Oliver,,"and but let's let's consider this hypothetical situation where we do have yes student ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch again we have to watch this but um i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today and like in particular there was all these things that you were doing with us that i think really helped us along as like students so like not only did you make sure that we used evidence from the text but you also really asked us lots of questions about like our thinking and you listen like really closely as we explained how we got to our answer you took all this time for us to explain our ideas and like i don't think class ever felt rushed like you know class like yeah i think class felt like they had time to do everything and like not only that but like we also felt really value so we all got to really feel like you know like like like i think like we all had good ideas even if we weren't right and then finally you like helped us to explain what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas on like how we could improve our answers but then you let us improve the answers so it was pretty cool working with thank you so much for being here today "
10536,150.1,Luis,,"alright so class you did really well with your response and i'm with the text but i have a couple questions when to help us further our knowledge and understanding of the texts are you class ready ","excuse me teacher "
10538,150.1,Luis,,,"um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
10540,110.3,Luis,,"whoo that's fabulous maybe you can help us understand even more about space so stay with this class you might be able to help us ","okay "
10543,120.2,Jazmin,,"all right so here's my first question what tools and equipment did you see that the astronauts were using in space ","i saw that they used to small machine "
10545,230.1,Jazmin,,"do you remember what that machine was ","no "
10548,120.2,Farrah,,"miss student i saw that your hand was raised what what kind of toll or equipment did they use ","have i said that they use the microscope "
10550,230.1,Farrah,,"awesome what is the microscope d ","is when you can look at things that are like really really small "
10552,140.1,Farrah,,"so like an ant ","yeah yeah just like an aunt or something like that "
10554,140.1,Farrah,,"can i look at something that's smaller than and because i didn't see an am with my eyes ","i'm walking yeah yeah like in science class we look at like these little bitty um oh i don't remember the names of it but we look at things that are like little bitty teeny teeny thing "
10556,140.1,Oliver,,"oh like organisms ","yeah like an amoeba also have an hour with a cold amoeba "
10560,120.4,,,"oh they can ask you this ","um i i mean i guess i can see it on the microscope we "
10564,120.2,Jazmin,,"okay so was there any other equipment that we used ","excuse me i see i see more words in the sentence but i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10567,430.2,Jazmin,,"you're answer isn't specific enough about what the details of the small machine so there was a small machine used but what exactly was that small machine used for ","yeah is they said he was caught the lunar orbiter "
10570,210.4,Jazmin,,"what did it say that we did with it ","they said it lands at the south pole and looks for ice to pass it and a large polar crater "
10576,210.4,Chris,,,"yeah i see what you're saying um i guess we wouldn't look for a big pond of water with a microscope because we can see that When I read it. i sort of put the craters were full of water "
10579,130.1,Chris,,"mm hmm but what miss student just read and what's advantages told us it makes me think that there might not be full of water that we can see what do you class think ","i don't know you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks shoots "
10582,210.3,Jazmin,,"But the water. When you think about water on the moon, are you thinking about oceans or are you thinking about those small those craters filled up with small amounts of water. ","oh well definitely thinking about the craters i'm student i don't remember what did you say about the craters oh "
10585,120.3,All,,"well let's look at paragraph three reading ","No. "
10590,110.1,Luis,,"so you class are completely right about the winner equipment and the microscope ","face masks they use masks true to green "
10593,230.1,Luis,,"why do you think that they have to use mass to breathe on the moon ","cash because there isn't the same kind of air that we breathe here so we can't breathe that era there "
10599,140.1,Oliver,,"so on the periodic element table there is owed to that stands for oxygen water is h two o mr oliveron ","yeah i'm sorry to interrupt you miss i burnt i think i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch so thanks for working with us "
10601,140.1,All,,,"okay bye "
10605,120.4,Luis,,"alright class so where we left off we were talking about and the periodic element table and mr student in your response to this second question do you remember what you said about the water ","um let me see but i did want you to i just want to remind you my dad is an astronaut okay let's see what i said water can be split into two parts "
10607,230.1,Luis,,"what were those two parts that you said ","hydrogen and oxygen "
10614,130.2,Luis,,"so mm hmm if you can split water up into two elements like you said how can you and mr student that said that they had to use oxygen tanks come up with what the astronauts could use water on the main for ","um okay so f fair water is h2o all you're saying hydrogen and oxygen mm hmm and you said that student said oxygen tank okay "
10622,130.2,Luis,,"by using what you and mr student and mr student you can talk to student and see how good your response and student just wanted to work together to help astronauts ","okay so so i was talking about the meeting debrief and you said that to student and you're talking about them needing to drink on okay so i mean that makes me think you know like water is important to breathe them to drink wait but that's we don't we don't breathe water um okay um no we don't breathe water but we do breathe oxygen okay okay so if water gets like split up into on hydrogen and oxygen then okay help me out student okay so we can drink the water and we can break the water okay so then that's as that the answer was ms abernathy "
10629,120.4,Jazmin,,"miss student what do you think ","well i was thinking about the water can use you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
10631,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay well what do we know that the moon doesn't have ","of plants "
10634,210.3,Jazmin,,"right what are we trying to make by student tanks and luis's two elements oh ","it doesn't have enough water to grow things "
10639,210.4,Jazmin,,"Breathe in. ","Oxygen. It doesn't have oxygen. "
10641,210.3,Jazmin,,"so is it going to have a moon garden ","no that could be something valuable "
10650,120.1,Chris,,"student i want you to think about the microscope again because i really loved how you were able to tell me that a microscope is used for something i can't see ","Okay, yeah, I remember where that was cuz i encircled it before okay so miss abernathy i was thinking and okay so water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen the oxygen a brief um what what do we use the hydrogen for "
10653,130.2,Farrah,,"oh i think it takes can someone find it ","okay um so in paragraph three is where it talked about this the microscope and "
10658,110.1,Farrah,,"macroscopic right ","No, no. "
10660,210.4,Farrah,,"cuz it's right but think about when you go to the grocery store and you buy two gallons of water is that heavy ","yeah yeah my mom always makes me carry the groceries inside and my arms are always like hurting so much "
10662,210.3,Farrah,,"so hmm is this patient very large ","ah i think it's got to be pretty big yeah maybe "
10664,210.3,Farrah,,"maybe but do you think they had to have a lot of equipment on there ","um yeah to go to space i figure you got to have a lot of stuff "
10668,210.3,Farrah,,"i would tell you so do you think that they would have enough space for gallons and gallons of heavy water or do you think we could use something on the moon ","okay okay thinking about that they wouldn't might not have enough space because i got a bunch of stuff "
10672,120.3,Oliver,,"do me a favor i want you to look at paragraph five ","okay one word or can be useful and other ways okay um water can be broken down into parts hydrogen and oxygen and i swear i swear i'm password student said astronauts could breathe oxygen can we say that one already the oxygen "
10674,130.2,Oliver,,"now now you class have not but you class were so close so have mr student and history student out death ","okay so so it sounds that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and and that it says that i should not breathe oxygen and that's important "
10679,120.4,Oliver,,"all right miss some vana have you figured out ","i'm sorry to interrupt miss abernathy but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for helping us keep thinking more and more and more about the thinking and really making us have to keep on talking to each other and thinking about our ideas "
10683,120.4,Farrah,,,"how are you "
10686,120.4,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so here's the thing i know all about space like i don't think i really need any help i don't really need to be in this class "
10688,150.1,Luis,,"okay but um and i appreciate that you know so much about this but at the same time we can always learn more so why don't you stick with us and we'll see what we can discover together ","okay yeah i can stick around "
10692,150.1,Oliver,,"that work ","that sounds great "
10694,230.1,Farrah,,"okay so um miss student you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely what do you know about a microscope ","so a microscope is like something that you like you use to see something that's really small "
10697,140.1,Farrah,,"yes yes you do do you know anywhere else that they might use a microscope ","like well we use it in like science class yeah like to like look at samples of stuff "
10703,230.2,Chris,,"can you tell me where in our texts that it said that there was craters full of water on the moon ","um yeah i can do that um okay let's see so um i guess in the i guess in paragraph one it says that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters um and then like in paragraph two it it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
10706,210.4,Chris,,"okay so let me ask you to close your eyes and think and draw a picture in your mind of what you think a crater looks like is it small is it big how are you picturing it ","um i guess it could be a couple like it could be any size because depending on like how how big it is like it could be bigger or it could be small "
10713,230.3,Jazmin,,"You need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. ","so i guess what i saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there i guess that's kind of what i saw "
10717,210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah i like that student do you still feel like it would be craters full of water on there do you think it's gonna be a little bit less than what you said ","well because it sounds like i guess it sounds like there's a little less water but there's not that much water but there's just a little bit of water Actually, I have a question. So if it sounds like then that we needed to use the microscope, but so is my answer wrong. Like, did they not use the small machine? "
10721,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay so we're going to i was coming to you miss student and you said that they sent a small machine they did send a small machine but can you find in that paragraph why they sent that small machine and what it was used for ","so in paragraph two it says that nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this machine and it was like the lunar orbiter was looking for ice "
10726,110.2,Chris,,"hmm i suppose it's in a large polar crater right okay now your answer is correct they did use that equipment to see if there was ice deposit ","i guess not i guess they must have used all of them like different like the microscop and the lunar orbiter Um, yeah. I have a question, like so. My dad took me to NASA. And we saw that like astronauts have to use like space suits and like oxygen tanks and all that stuff like, um, do they, do they like, do they have to use that stuff, didn't they have to use that to discover the water? "
10728,210.3,Chris,,"they will if as if an astronaut went to the moon they definitely would have to but when we look at this this text do we have evidence that an astronaut or a person went to the moon or was it machines ","oh okay yeah i guess they don't really i guess they don't really say "
10731,410.2,Oliver,,"mr student talks about how they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in our texts but it doesn't say anything about oxygen tanks do they do use them yes but not in this text ","um yeah so um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us today and i really wanted to thank you for hor having us listen to each other's answers closely because we don't always really like have a chance to listen to each other really closely and it was really nice the way that you like had us listen to each other and try to learn from each other so just like thank you so much because that doesn't always happen thank you "
10734,410.2,Farrah,,,"thank you yeah we can hear you "
10738,410.2,Luis,,,"yeah yeah um but i have a quick question "
10740,410.2,Luis,,,"okay so i can know like all about space and um i don't think i really need help like i don't think i really need to be in this class "
10743,110.1,Luis,,"you don't well i'm again this is a more of a discussion based exercise so maybe you have something you can contribute to this class ","yeah okay i see that "
10745,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so real quick back to the last question student can you repeat the answer in that you came up with for this ","oh yeah okay so basically you just need a scientific a tool called a microscope to look really closely "
10750,120.1,Jazmin,,"you might want to take another guess at the tool used to get that to get those microscopic images ","so i think that it was the small machine that they sent that's what they used "
10753,120.3,Jazmin,,"if you class have your text handy i would use it ","the lunar orbiter in paragraph twol "
10757,150.1,Farrah,,"does class agree with this ","okay so i'm actually wondering like why is my answer wrong "
10761,210.2,Farrah,,"well you had the right idea about the microscopic water molecules but if you look closely at the question it was asking what the tool was to get that sample ","gotcha so they used "
10763,210.2,Oliver,,,"so they used lunar orbiter "
10767,130.3,Chris,,"yes ","yes they use the lunar orbiter to discover it and then they use the microscope to study i think is that right okay that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense um yeah but i'm okay i have a question "
10769,130.3,Chris,,,"okay so i went to nasa and with my dad and i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff to go up into space like they didn't did they not use that stuff to to discover the water "
10775,130.1,Chris,,"yes they did use oxygen tanks to find water you know but that was not exactly the purpose that those oxygen tanks were designed for ","well they're they're yeah they're designed so you can you can breathe in space "
10778,210.1,Chris,,"but is that the specific oliverice used to find the microscopic water samples ","no no that that was the the lunar orbiter "
10785,410.1,Jazmin,,"it's not the specific tool used to get to the water to get those samples that's what the question was asking ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you you were so clear with helping us to understand like what we were looking for and we were able to really listen to each other's answers really closely and you made sure that that class had a chance to talk which was awesome because we don't always get a chance to talk during class so thank you so much because i think we all really learned a lot from from each other thanks to you too thank you so much "
10787,410.1,Oliver,,,"hi how are you doing today "
10789,410.1,Oliver,,,"great excited to work with you "
10791,410.1,Luis,,,"yeah so i don't think that i need to be in this class because i know like everything that there is to know about space all that stuff already "
10794,110.3,Luis,,"and maybe you can help some of the other students because for some students this might be their first time learning about space ","okay yeah i can do that "
10799,120.4,Farrah,,"you class want to share your responses to this article ","sure we can do that um okay so i said you need a microscope to do the water "
10803,230.2,Farrah,,"okay yeah okay would you mind reading a section of the passage where you found this answer ","um yeah i can do that let's see um i said the water they found is microscopic meaning you would be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a special tool called a microscope to look really close "
10806,130.2,Chris,,"so what other kinds of equipment would you class say that you would need to find water on the moon other than a microscope ","you'd need spacesuits and like stuff for astronauts like i've been to nasa so i know that you have to use all that stuff "
10811,130.2,Jazmin,,"Does anybody have any ideas, Jazmin. ","i said the small machine but i'm not quite sure why my answer is wrong "
10815,230.2,Jazmin,,"could you share with the class the section that mentioned this tool ","okay so in paragraph two and it says nasa send this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10817,210.4,Jazmin,,"what would you tell me the purpose of the lunar orbiter would be based on the text ","like is it i mean i guess it's to find the water to like you know what i mean like to go get the water "
10820,110.4,Chris,,"correct ","well i guess i still am thinking like i went to nasa so i know that the scientists like us all this equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all that kind of stuff "
10827,210.4,Oliver,,"This lunar module again just like Jazmin said was sent to the moon to find ice deposits and large and large polar craters. This would help them find water. ","mmm hmm actually we have to go to lunch but thank you so much for working with us "
10831,210.4,Luis,,,"yeah you know ah i just want to remind you that my dad is an astronaut "
10838,110.3,Farrah,,"and needs and these can be things that you're dad can use being an astronaut okay we'll start over here with student ","um yeah okay so i said no no not for a long time "
10842,230.1,Farrah,,"you want to explain that ","um yeah so like you know like is there convincing evidence that of water on the moon could be valuable i don't think it will be valuable like now cuz you know cuz we don't we don't know how to i guess we know how would you i mean like it would be really hard to use it so i don't think it's valuable right now "
10847,120.4,Oliver,,"first let's hear student what's your response ","yeah i kind of had a similar thought that basically no it's not ready yet you know what i mean like that we can't we can't just use the water because it's all ice you know "
10850,120.4,Chris,,"great student ","um yeah so i would say water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships "
10852,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay so we have it's heavy and we have the we believe us not valuable yet student ","i think it would be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and they can stay hydrated and like you can't survive without water and i was thinking basically what you could do is you could use the water to grow things you could have a garden on the moon in the craters "
10854,110.2,Luis,,"okay so that could be a one use of water student ","um yeah like water can be split into two parts it can be you know hydrogen and oxygen "
10858,230.2,Luis,,"do you want to describe where in the text you found this ","on yeah yeah i can do that okay so let's see um in paragraph five moon water could be useful in other ways and water can be broken down to two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
10861,210.4,Luis,,"and now what do you think we can use those two for hydrogen and oxygen ","um yeah i think like okay you could use it or okay well you could breathe it um and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel "
10863,210.4,Luis,,,"as well rocket fuel "
10865,110.1,Chris,,"rocket fuel so rocket fuel will be a use and student you could drink it you can use it to grow things student ","on yeah i guess i just wanted to say this like water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and they both are important "
10876,210.4,Oliver,,"But there are some uses that we could use water for in the future, even for some now we would just have to use technology to make that happen. Yes, Oliver. ","and we unfortunately have to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us and especially i wanted to thank you for really listening for answers and really making us feel like "
10878,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i i know all about space so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all this stuff "
10880,220.1,Luis,,"well guess what we're going to learn some new things today you might find something that you didn't know ","okay that sounds cool "
10883,120.2,Farrah,,"alright so we are going i had asked the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","whoa i guess i kind of like um no i just saw the microscope "
10886,130.2,Jazmin,,"right did class else see anything else in the text that you might use so we have a microscope student ","basically what i thought is its a small machine "
10890,210.4,Jazmin,,"can you go back in the text and find what that small machine is called ","yeah okay it's called the number 2 paragraph 2 so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
10893,130.2,Oliver,,"so now we know they have student you remember what i tools the scientist used ","um yeah so i guess they used the microscope and the lunar orbiter is that right "
10895,110.1,Farrah,,"with job yes right so you all now know here student ","i have a quick question "
10897,110.1,Farrah,,,"oh yeah i i was just wondering like is my is my was my answer right or was it wrong "
10899,130.1,Farrah,,"well it was right you had one thing but then we had to find the other tools that scientists used so you had it almost right we just had a fun one more tool ","gotcha "
10901,130.1,Chris,,,"yes so i was just wondering like so like here's what i know is that like i went to nasa with my dad and he like we went we looked all over the place and i know that that like you have to use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots and stuff like that but is that is that not part of the answer "
10903,420.2,Chris,,"um well the question asked according to the text so we had to use what we had in the text to answer our questions so we had to find evidence so you might be right from what you know from your dad going to nasa we have to use the text in order to answer the question ","oh so it's like whatever's in the reading ok that makes sense "
10906,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm still kind of wondering about the like so did they did they not have to use like did the astronauts have to use um did they not leave the the lunar orbiter did they stay in the in the lunar orbiter like how did they use the microscope "
10908,110.1,Luis,,"so i'm not real sure we would have to read more on that and see exactly how they used it and what they felt maybe they discovered with it so we might read another article and see what we can find out ","oh okay "
10910,110.1,Jazmin,,,"i just wanted to thank you for working with us today thank you very much for especially for like really just like helping us to understand and be really kind in how thoughtful you are with sort of like talking to us today so thank you so much "
10916,110.1,Luis,,"so student you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to work really closely yes student ","excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
10922,120.1,Farrah,,"but what other tool was using the story to help find water on the moon ","oh i don't know "
10934,130.2,Chris,,"is there somebody student would you like to help her out ","yes had to be from the craters the craters for the water "
10938,130.1,Farrah,,"so student helped us by saying that there was a matter microscope but we're still trying to figure out what other tool even do you have any audio ","teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
10940,120.4,Farrah,,"what was your answer ","i mean this is me student i looked at over and i don't understand why why the microscope is raw "
10948,210.4,Jazmin,,"can you look back and tell us what that small machine is called ","okay "
10956,520.1,Oliver,,"so now that you've figured out the full answer what will you do next time when you're looking back in the text ","look at the story again to find a full answer Okay, well thanks teacher, um, it's time for us to go to lunch. Thanks for working with us. "
10961,120.2,Luis,,"responses to your questions or to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead student what's your question ","um well i was just excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
10979,120.1,Oliver,,"alright so student can you help me out after reading the story again ","microscope "
10985,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you remember what the name of that small machine was ","i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
10994,210.2,Jazmin,,"but it's asking what the name of the tool is so let's go back and see if we can find what the name of the tool is ","see if you can look the shark oh i see if i'm a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11001,520.1,Jazmin,,"alright so next time go back and look in the story to find your answer ","i still think it's interesting story um i guess i just needed more words in my answer "
11003,110.1,Oliver,,"Right so y'all did an awesome job. ","okay oh thank you so much teacher for really helping us by by telling us the things that we did do well and then i'm like helping us to look back at the story again to find our answer "
11008,120.2,Luis,,"so what did you class think for the question what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ","i thought it was pretty easy excuse me i'm shouldn't be and this class i already know a lot about space "
11010,120.4,Luis,,"oh whoa whoa what did you respond to that question ","well i said that um you know that they could use um maybe that's uh "
11013,120.4,Luis,,,"I'm oxygen tanks. "
11016,130.3,Luis,,"close i bet you they didn't use oxygen tanks while they were there ","Okay. "
11018,130.3,Oliver,,,"well i probably use the microscope arm because it says that thing they let me see what it says it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
11020,310.1,Oliver,,"so you found that directly in the text that's really good ","yeah so i don't know why why i'm here honestly cause i gave an answer from the text "
11026,150.1,Jazmin,,"them what did you think ","well i don't understand why my answers wrong um cuz i pull mine from the text to "
11028,110.2,Jazmin,,"i don't think your answer was necessarily wrong at all it was a small machine ","so so how come i'm in this class "
11031,150.1,Jazmin,,"his answer is not that you class answered anything wrong at all just to kind of think more about it ","okay "
11034,150.1,Farrah,,,"oh well i had the same answer is def so um i know the teacher said that that we we like you said we've got to elaborate on our answers but i used i used all of the like the words from the text and she said we have to use evidence from the text and i did that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely i mean it's right there so i don't i don't know why why i'm in this class either "
11038,120.3,Farrah,,"why don't we all take a look at number two on the worksheet good somebody read that for me ","and i repeat it i'm nasa to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter south pole for look for ice deposits this is deposits are very small scientists that have that window of the top layer of a moon surface into about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink and "
11045,110.2,Oliver,,"but you guys all gave answers that were very valid. ","okay so you're saying i'm over answers okay but we just had to write more "
11048,150.1,Chris,,"and it was definitely tricky to find and it would maybe take even reading it a couple times to find that ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits to i know a lot about equipment but i didn't see that part "
11052,110.1,Oliver,,"and that happens ","well i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch and i know it was really sharp but i do appreciate how you told us that we have we just have to look and look again and look even closer at the story to find more information i guess so thank you "
11055,110.1,Oliver,,,"okay class say hi "
11060,120.2,Luis,,"so today we're going to talk about after the reading do you think that water is a valuable resource to astronauts ","yeah okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
11063,120.4,Luis,,"okay do you want to share with us what you thought is water a valuable resource ","yeah okay so um i said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
11066,210.3,Luis,,"do you think that they would use both parts one part what do you think ","i think they use both parts "
11070,230.3,Luis,,"let's think about oxygen student you said about the last question that they use oxygen tanks right on the moon ","yeah right "
11073,130.3,Jazmin,,"maybe they could use the oxygen for the oxygen tanks ","yeah that makes sense that's okay so then that's that would be helpful i did too "
11075,120.4,Chris,,"yeah so that's one reason does class have any other reason that they thought that water was a valuable resource ","i did "
11077,120.4,Chris,,,"okay so i said all that water is heavy so it's good they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
11080,130.3,Chris,,"so if they could just pick it up on the moon then they wouldn't have to bring it with them and then they could maybe even bring something else that they liked maybe like a favorite stuffed animal or something ","i don't think the astronauts are bringing stuffed animals they're like grown ups and scientists and stuff "
11082,120.4,Jazmin,,"never know student what do you think okay so um ","hmm okay let's see i wrote yes i astronauts should stay and drink the water and stay hydrated oh like how you said you can't survive without water "
11084,230.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so you class kind of had the same idea that they have to bring water anyways so they could just pick some up while they're there ","so it me and student had some good ideas then how come we're in this class "
11086,150.1,Jazmin,,"is just a class to talk about the questions they don't mean anything specific ","oh i thought we were here cuz our our answers weren't weren't right "
11088,220.1,Jazmin,,"no we just wanted to talk about the answers and kind of see where you class got your answers from ","so then mine is good "
11090,110.2,Chris,,"yeah it was a good answer ","i don't have to change mine either "
11092,220.1,Jazmin,,"well we're all gonna collectively talk to each other if you wanted to add an aspect of another persons answer as well you class could totally add to it it's all about getting different parts of it ","oh okay i'm still confused "
11094,230.1,Farrah,,"mmmhmm about what ","i had a different answer from from them but if they're all right then the my answers right too "
11097,120.4,Farrah,,"what did you say water is a valuable resource or not ","i said no not for a long time "
11099,230.1,Farrah,,"not for a long time why do you think not for a long time ","because the story says that it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money um and they'd have to build new equipment and do you think this will be a good investment so i said no "
11103,210.3,Farrah,,"that's definitely an aspect of it um so do you think that it could be used as oxygen or water for the astronauts ","i mean yeah that makes that makes sense what the said exactly "
11105,110.2,Oliver,,"yeah no that's a very well olivereloped answer ","um well i i said it wasn't ready yet so i said no too "
11111,110.2,Chris,,"but as long as we gathered all of the information about the values of it then your answer is correct whether or not you think it is or not ","You know I I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
11113,110.3,Chris,,"wow that's pretty soon that's not very far away at all ","right it's all so maybe they if they have a base then they could have water there "
11116,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah ","so that we all did really well i thought that i thought that i'm wrong since you said that they were right okay "
11118,130.1,Oliver,,"no i think you all helped each other come to a big conclusion with a bunch of answers that you all might not have thought of after you read it for the first time it's nice to talk to other people and get ideas right ","yeah well well thanks teacher it's time for us to call but i wanted to say thanks for asking asking class about our thinking thinking that lead our answer so it it felt good to take some time to explain my idea so you know i felt valued "
11120,130.1,Oliver,,,"thanks okay bye bye okay "
11123,130.1,Luis,,,"i feel good i'm excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11127,220.1,Luis,,"so for this class we're just going to focus on some of the things that we read and how we can change our answers to better fit the reading does that sound good student ","yeah "
11133,110.2,Farrah,,"you really picked the object which was a microscope and you basically kind of described what it's used for outside of the text and you were using language that i really appreciate it ","thanks to "
11138,110.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i mean i just happen to have the same answer as it wasn't i didn't i didn't copy offer anything extra she said horse first i'm sorry i was like oh well that's the same thing i found in a story to "
11144,420.2,Oliver,,"understand maybe next time if you have the same idea someone you could just add a little more that you felt like they didn't say that you wanted to bring up ","hi i'm so on while i'm looking it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on i mean i guess are you saying that i should i shut off i could say but sometimes above that one to the waters founders microscopic "
11147,420.2,Jazmin,,"you could say that to like you can bring an example of ","I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
11155,210.4,Jazmin,,"we did read that it's called a moon lunar orbiter and that it investigates so that's why nasa sends it up there ","okay "
11158,210.4,Jazmin,,,"yeah i guess i'm just thinking okay so then what what are the words that i was supposed to add like i'm masses i should put the whole sentence matheson to small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11164,420.2,Jazmin,,"might slip through the cracks or just very keep it simple like nasa said the lunar orbiter to investigate ","i think so i think i think you're saying that um but i should say more stuff um but my my answer is too short and i needed to say more more stuff like that "
11166,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah like we should fill in the blanks just to make our sentence a little meteor ","okay i guess "
11170,420.2,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment mike oxygen tanks masks and suits to "
11174,420.3,Chris,,"so you can talk about your background knowledge just make sure you add a little bit of what is in the text that way i know that you understand what we're talking about ","was my answer right "
11181,220.1,Oliver,,"tweak them a little bit and improve them and adjust your sentences to just show that you understand what the text is saying i just wanted you class to use examples exactly from the text that way i know that you class had an easy time reading ","okay well i'm oh sorry student i just looked at four o'clock and it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for giving us specific suggestions and hopeful ideas on how each of us can improve our answers okay "
11184,220.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11186,220.1,Luis,,"okay well today we're going to experiment with different kinds of groups and if you know a lot about space then maybe you can help your table mates that we probably don't know as much as you do it sounds good to you student ","okay yeah okay i guess that's fine okay "
11190,220.1,Jazmin,,"there was a short reading and i gave you class two questions just to remind you what the questions are i'll read them out loud for you class the first question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ","the teacher said that we would only work on question number one right now "
11192,220.1,Jazmin,,"okay we'll just work on question number one thank you for letting me know so did you class will be time to write down your answers to questions ","yeah we put them down on our tablets to you "
11195,120.4,Jazmin,,"can i hear some of your responses ","do you want to hear mine "
11198,120.4,Jazmin,,,"okay i said that nasa a small machine "
11202,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay so when you say nasa send a small machine do you know what the name of it was ","oh the lunar obiter Okay. I can do that. "
11204,120.4,Farrah,,"does class else want to share they wrote ","oh well i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11206,150.1,Farrah,,"okay let's talk about it then what to do right student ","i said you need a scientific microscope to look really closely "
11209,110.2,Farrah,,"i don't think your answer is wrong we did read that you do need a microscope to look closely at the moon maybe we can rephrase that what do we use the microscope for do you remember ","you yeah to look at really small thing "
11212,110.1,Jazmin,,"exactly so we can always write that too i think your answer right now is just as good though good job ","i'm sorry teacher but how can it be right and my answer be great because we have two different answers "
11214,210.4,Oliver,,"The lunar orbiter is used to investigate what's on the moon, and the microscope like Farrah said is used to look at small particles, that the Lunar orbiter wouldn't really pick up so you're both re they're just used for different things. ","i circled the same thing with student so i guess i am right too "
11217,210.3,Oliver,,"yeah nor did you notice anything about will you circle anything special about the microscope ","well i noticed that he said the water that they follow those microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it "
11220,110.1,Oliver,,"that's a good point ","It can you say that again you're talking kind of fast. "
11224,420.2,Oliver,,"you can always write that even scientists use a microscope ","Okay, I got it now. "
11226,120.4,Chris,,"good i'm student student didn't want to do you want to share yes student ","yeah i was just i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
11229,140.1,Chris,,"do you know what they use oxygen for them suits that your classmates might not ","oh yeah so they use on a breathe because while the oxygen tanks are to breathe because there isn't any oxygen up there in space and then the suits because it's so cool that if if the air touch their skins they would they would freeze to death and then shattered pieces "
11232,120.4,Luis,,"student do you read something different or similar ","actually i wrote about the oxygen tanks too because that equipment and the question as our equipment and so i said you know the equipment that scientists use on them owner oxygen tank "
11234,110.1,Luis,,"so good answer to or like how different everyone's answers were and i felt that you all explained what the tools were used for in a perfect way ","so i'm right too it could be oxygen tanks or microscopes or lunar orbiter "
11238,210.4,Oliver,,"usually they try to find the similarities between the earth and the moon try to see if class from earth can be able to live in the moon ","i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye "
11240,210.4,All,,,"high "
11242,210.4,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11246,150.1,Chris,,"but i just want to talk with you class a little bit more specifically about the texts that we just read to make sure that class understands the water on the moon text ","yeah i also know about space as i went to nasa with my dad "
11250,150.1,Luis,,"to the text but i want to talk a little bit about how class responded after reading the text and i just want to kind of ask one more time ","i think the most important equipment was the microscope "
11253,150.1,Luis,,,"i've got my tone "
11258,210.4,Jazmin,,"so this tool it was mentioned in the text and i want to see it does class remember what was said in the text about the lunar orbiter ","oh i don't remember what i said in the text but that was kind of my answer so i don't have to say my my answers wrong "
11264,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","i have to i have to write more stuff in my answer "
11266,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i just want your answer to be a little more specific and sometimes that does mean writing more stuff ","okay "
11268,110.1,Luis,,"right so looking at the other responses i'm student i want to talk about your response you said that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right ","a hack "
11273,110.3,Luis,,"and they would need those on the moon and i know you said you know a lot about space so that is a very good response ","Um, yeah i mean we're we're reading about the mon and so i i wrote about em and an astronaut equipment and so i'm like well this is some equipment i know they need on the moon "
11276,410.3,Luis,,"but in your answer i also would have liked to see you mention the lunar orbiter because that was the big idea of the text that we read and that was the most important piece for specifically finding water on the moon ","yeah i guess so "
11279,150.1,Chris,,"okay if you have any questions let me know ","yeah yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment my oxygen tanks and masks answer "
11284,420.2,Chris,,"something specifically from the text so the text mentions the lunar orbiter so that would have been a good thing to include in your response in addition to what you said about finding craters of water and they're like suits masks and oxygen tanks does that make sense ","yeah i think you're saying like okay i gotta i gotta use more more stuff in the text and use what i already know "
11288,510.1,Oliver,,"yes that is exactly what i would like and that goes for class not just student so when you're answering these questions try to use what you already know as well as specific information from what we're reading ","yeah yeah i felt like i did that you know i mean i looked at the question and the question asked about equipment and and asked about like what equipment that they use to discover water and so when i was walking in the in the story and i saw that on microsoft is equipment and we're using a microscope to look at the water so i felt like i get all the right thing i don't know why white minus wrong "
11296,410.3,Oliver,,"uh huh yeah and they definitely do need to use a microscope but the big idea of the story is the lunar orbiter and that that is the most important piece to discovering water on the moon but i also just want to make sure that you're focusing on what the big idea of the whole reading is instead of just one specific part ","i'm a big idea not just one part okay okay well i just looked at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short but um i i do appreciate that you helped us all kind of look more at the text to try to use more evidence and our answer so thanks for that okay bye "
11299,220.1,Luis,,"hi class so i pulled you all into a small class because i think you did a really good job in answering our discussion question about the water on the moon texts but i want to work with each of you a little more and just make your responses more academic and a little longer yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11305,120.1,Farrah,,"make sure that when you are using the specific name of a tool it's the tool that the question is asking for so in this question what equipment was used to discover water on the moon is there another tool you can think of that the scientists used from the text ","well i thought that was the correct tool because it says in the third paragraph that they used it to look really closely at the water and the question is asking about looking at water "
11308,210.4,Farrah,,"so if you look at the second paragraph can you read the first sentence for me ","okay let me see sorry my my tablets not loading oh give me a second "
11312,210.4,Farrah,,,"okay okay so you said the second paragraph "
11314,120.3,Farrah,,"yep the first sentence of the second paragraph okay ","nasa sent a small machine to the moon to investigate "
11320,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11323,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so that is a really good answer and you're definitely correct but i want you to elaborate a little bit more so yes nasa sent a small machine but what was that small machine called ","i guess it was what student just read right the lunar orbiter "
11326,150.1,Jazmin,,"hey you really know what you're talking about and it also shows that you found your answer from the text does that make sense class ","yeah it makes sense to use that i have to use it okay "
11328,120.4,Luis,,"awesome um okay so student i know you are unsure about being in this class can we look at your response ","yeah yeah sure "
11335,130.3,Chris,,"because that is the piece of equipment that ultimately the question wants you to pick out of the text yes student ","and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah "
11343,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah yeah okay but my question did come from the text i mean my answer did "
11349,150.1,Chris,,"does that make a little more ","i mean i guess i can see it for student because she just had to add more the specific name but they didn't say like the more specific name of the craters in the in the story "
11352,130.3,Oliver,,"yeah you're right i'm sorry i think i said that in a bit of a confusing way so you want to make sure that you would say scientists found craters of water on the moon and the machine that they used to find these craters was the lunar orbiter ","i'm sorry teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay "
11356,230.3,Oliver,,"and we'll start with a student this time so you answered that um no the water on the moon is not ready yet correct ","correct "
11360,230.2,Oliver,,"okay um so what in the text makes you think that ","ok so when i was reading it and i'm in the last paragraph it says i'm making this plan will take a lot of time and money do you think about you decide and so i'm like well if it's gonna take a lot of time and i mean it's not ready yet "
11364,210.3,Oliver,,"is asking could water on the moon be valuable at any point um and so you said no but i'm wondering if you think that the answer could be yes um and why it could be yes ","so why could it be yes i'm thinking "
11366,210.3,Luis,,,"okay um while he's thinking i got this figured out this time so now i'm all good "
11369,230.1,Luis,,"okay i'm glad that you're feeling more confident um why do you think you are feeling more confident ","okay because i i get it now that i'm supposed to like you know read the question and then read it and then find the evidence so yeah i think i'm good here "
11371,230.3,Luis,,"that's a really good strategy um so in your response you said that water can be split into hydrogen and oxygen right yeah ","straight from the text "
11375,210.3,Farrah,,"awesome yes it is um but i do want to ask you while that is from the text does that tell us if the water on the moon is valuable ","oh okay oh okay all right while student is thinking um i had a similar answer to student and so i think i'm still kind of confused "
11378,230.1,Farrah,,"so where are you confused student ","okay um because it asks is if it's valuable right "
11384,230.1,Farrah,,,"and so it said okay they would need to study the moon surface and build new equipment so that sounds like it would take a lot of money which if it's not ready then it's not valuable right "
11389,210.3,Farrah,,"so even though it's not ready yet student do you think that the water on the moon could be valuable in the future ","yeah yeah. "
11391,420.1,Farrah,,"you're fully understanding what the questions asking, because that could be makes a big difference from the present to the future. ","okay "
11394,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make more sense to you two or are you still confused ","um yeah i think i didn't really look at that word could be so yeah that makes sense "
11396,150.1,Chris,,,"talking about the future i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
11398,140.1,Chris,,"that's really cool fact student where did you read that ","me and my dad had been reading this book about aviation and then we went to nasa so there was this whole exhibit about the traveling to the moon and then what their plans are in the future "
11407,420.2,Chris,,"and what you could do with that so in your response you could have added something like in another article i read it said that there could be a base on the moon and then connect to the article we're reading now so do you have any idea of how you could do that ","okay okay so there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and so then they won't have to carry the water in the ships anymore so how's that "
11409,420.2,Chris,,"pretty good i would maybe just add a little bit about how like you said they're not carrying the water on the ships anymore because they're keeping it at the base that they're going to build on the moon ","yeah yeah yeah okay okay "
11411,150.1,Chris,,"does hat makes sense so you're connecting both sets of text with just a few words there ","yeah yeah yeah yeah i think "
11413,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay awesome um so student do you have any questions about your response ","well okay i think i did what what student and student didn't do is i answered the question i said yes and then i also did the thing where i i i pulled the evidence from the text so i guess i don't know why mine is wrong "
11419,210.4,Jazmin,,"go back and look at the text so in that first paragraph there paragraph four um it says you know future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy and it takes up a lot of room ","Okay yeah yeah yeah I have an idea. "
11423,120.4,Jazmin,,"do you want to share ","you want me to share now okay okay um so yes astronauts could drink the water and because it's heavy they won't have to carry it on the ship they can drink it from the moon "
11426,530.1,Jazmin,,"how did your thinking change there what did you do differently ","well i i use two sentences i use my sentence and then kind of student sentence and then i set it up because in there too "
11429,150.1,Farrah,,"yeah so because statements are a really good way to make sure that you have enough evidence to support what you're saying yes student ","well it's time for us to go to lunch but i do want to say i appreciate um how are you kind of explain what each of us needs to work on and how we can improve our answers yeah me too bye bye "
11431,150.1,Luis,,,"hi "
11433,150.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11436,150.1,Farrah,,"oh no it's not anything like that i'm sure you all have your own great knowledge of space we're just going to discuss a little bit of how we read and responded to the passage do you class remember the passage about water on the moon ","uh-huh yeah i have it on my tablet right here yeah it's on our tablets on our desk "
11441,120.2,Farrah,,"so when you read it you should have known what the equipment was that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah the equipment was the microscope "
11444,110.1,Jazmin,,"exactly that's perfect ","oh but miss teacher i didn't have the microscope i said the equipment was a small machine from paragraph two "
11448,150.1,Jazmin,,"so does class understand that now from the passage ","um i mean i think so but i okay i'm going to listen more and then i'll see if i have a question "
11454,120.3,Jazmin,,"it says that means that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth so water they found is microscopic meaning you would not be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real closely ","um "
11457,120.3,Jazmin,,,"oh i still don't understand why my answer is wrong because i i looked in paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11460,210.4,Jazmin,,"if you kept reading in paragraph three you would have seen the real word for the small machine ","um ok "
11465,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay does that make sense ","um i mean i i did read the third paragraph but i didn't think that the microscope was the right answer because it said it said you that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it is that you would need a scientific tool so that means you would need a microscope to look really closely but it doesn't say that they had a microscope to look really closely and so that's why i thought it was the lunar orbiter in paragraph two because they said that that was that they sent that to look for the ice in the craters "
11468,150.1,Chris,,"so does class else have anything that they were confused about ","it's not so much confused but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11472,150.1,Luis,,"does class else have questions on the passage ","okay well i don't know why mine was wrong because i mean i know i know a lot about space and so i know that um scientists and astronauts like they have to use oxygen tanks to go to go to the moon they can't breathe "
11474,210.3,Luis,,"right you you did mention that in your response which was great i'm glad that you could acknowledge that it's just the oxygen tank could you use an oxygen tank to find water on the moon ","umm huh "
11477,130.1,Luis,,"but it would it wouldn't be the thing that found the water ","okay okay yeah "
11479,150.1,Luis,,"that was a really good thing to if i asked about anything you needed to go to the moon that would be a great part of your response but do you see where the question was a little bit different than your answer ","um cuz yeah well i mean yeah cuz well when you said okay you don't need the oxygen tank to find water you need oxygen tank to breathe so yeah yeah okay "
11482,120.4,Oliver,,"student do you have anything to say ","well i mean i i circled the same thing as student um so i guess i mean i don't know why i'm in this class if we're right then what's wrong with with my answer "
11485,430.2,Oliver,,"you just um didn't really have anything to say that you found on your own you just said you circled the same thing as student so i really wanted to hear in your own thoughts not in farrah's thoughts um what you found in the passage and how you did it ","oh ok ok well yeah i mean i just found i read the whole thing and then in the last sentence of the last paragraph i saw where they said a scientific tool called a microscope so i was like okay yeah that's that's equipment and we use that equipment in science class and they're looking at the water "
11489,110.1,Oliver,,"good i'm glad i could hear your own words ","okay okay okay miss teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it's what's a short time and we just met but i i did appreciate how you you helped all of us kind of talk about and ask questions from you and i heard how you told student that his answer was cool but it didn't come from the question and so i'm going to think about that when we go to lunch "
11492,120.4,Luis,,"okay class do you mind giving me your answers again really quickly before i give you some feedback ","um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11495,120.4,Luis,,"but we're going to figure that out right now so can you could you remind me what your answer was ","yeah okay i said ah scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
11498,210.2,Luis,,"okay so the question asked what equipment did they use to find water on the moon ","um well i mean they have to use oxygen tanks to breathe because they can't breathe on the moon without the oxygen tanks you know "
11502,120.4,Jazmin,,"student how about you ","um my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
11506,210.4,Jazmin,,"what did the small machine do what was its purpose on the moon ","um nasa since a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok it investigated "
11509,210.4,Jazmin,,"what specifically did it investigate ","um it investigated um the lunar orbiter um to investigate to look for ice deposits "
11511,210.4,Jazmin,,"right and ice is water correct just frozen ","oh yeah yeah "
11513,210.4,Jazmin,,"the small machine is the lunar orbiter that was sent to investigate and look for water on the moon ","oh i did it that was the right answer i did it "
11515,110.1,Jazmin,,"it's one of the right answers yeah ","student okay go me "
11518,120.4,Chris,,"good job all right student your turn ","uh huh okay so i said or something different i said umm that scientists found craters full water on the moon "
11522,120.2,Chris,,"okay let's think back to the question the question was what equipment did nasa use to find water on the moon ","what equipment did they use oh it's what student just said "
11526,120.1,Farrah,,"that wasn't student or luis's answer ","oh well i i i had some equipment but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
11530,120.4,Farrah,,"alright so we're student do your best let's look through the text again and we're going to come back to you okay student what was your answer ","oh my answer was that um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but if jazmin's right and she has a different answer than me um i don't know why why is mine wrong "
11534,150.1,Farrah,,"Do you need a reminder of what the question was? ","oh no i can see it um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon well i mean it says that they look at the water with a microscope that's equipment um "
11536,210.4,Farrah,,"why did they need the microscope ","because the water was really small "
11541,120.4,Oliver,,"um student how about you ","um okay well i i had the same answer as student cuz i i said the thing the same thing about how they went um so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um cuz cuz okay well that's the only that's the only paragraph that says says water and has an equipment in it "
11544,150.1,Chris,,"if you need a second to look back and find another piece of equipment we can come back to you and i can move on to student again ","yeah so i went to nasa so i know that it is used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11548,230.2,Chris,,"did you find any evidence of them using those masks or suits in the text ","oh no no um ok so the only things that i saw was the microscope that student and student said and the lunar orbiter that student said so i don't know which one is the right "
11551,120.4,Chris,,"well there's multiple pieces of equipment so they're all right um what was your original answer let's build off of that ","okay so i said that they found a lot of water in the craters yeah "
11555,210.4,Chris,,"if you go back to the microscope that student was talking about how did they find water using the microscope ","you can't really find water using the microscope it's not like it's like binoculars or something you could only look at water um using a microscope yeah "
11558,210.4,Chris,,"so they had to use the microscope to know that there was water on the moon ","well how did they find the water first to even put it underneath the microscope "
11561,110.1,Jazmin,,"that is a good question ","Well, that's why I thought that maybe my answer was the right one. Because, um, cuz the the Lunar Orbiter, I think, that they sent to investigate. Um, I think maybe. "
11567,210.4,Oliver,,"Using small machine that Jazmin identified ","I'm sorry to interrupt teacher, but I was looking at the clock and it's it's time for us to go to lunch. So I wanted to say goodbye and thanks for for for working with us you know um yeah that was kind of fun like i i see how we have to keep going back you kept saying okay go back to the text "
11574,230.2,Farrah,,"using a microscope as a piece of equipment ","okay it was in the last paragraph "
11577,110.1,Farrah,,"okay thank you student we're gonna get to your answer in a few minutes ","okay so it said i'm in the third paragraph the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
11583,230.1,Oliver,,"that was a great answer so student you circle the same as student what led you to seeing that a microscope is a piece of equipment that the scientists used ","well the question was asking about where they discovered the water and that was the only part where they had equipment and water and finding it so i looked for all the keywords and that's what's this the section of the story with the keywords "
11586,210.4,Jazmin,,"equipment could be a machine a piece of technology do you see anything in this text that is not a microscope but is a piece of equipment ","teacher i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
11590,110.1,Oliver,,"we will go over your answer in a few minutes right now we're focusing on student but i'll have time for you to explain your thinking ","okay i see one more piece of equipment in paragraph two yeah I saw lunar orbiter. "
11592,210.4,Oliver,,"can you tell me what a lunar lunar orbiter is ","okay it's a small machine it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
11598,210.4,Oliver,,"now how did they use the lunar orbiter to find water ","ice ice is also water. "
11603,120.4,Chris,,"what was your answer can you remind me ","yeah i said that scientists found crators full of water on the moon "
11608,230.1,Chris,,"what led you to finding that waters are full craters are full of water on the moon ","in the first paragraph i was looking for like the keywords like how student was saying you know and i'm looking for like finding water on the moon in this sentence had like a bunch of those words scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and so that's got like all of the things about finding water on the moon "
11612,210.2,Chris,,"now they did find water on the moon but what equipment did they use to find that water ","is the one that Oliver said. "
11616,140.1,Chris,,"how did they get to the moon ","i do know that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11620,110.2,Chris,,"so how do you think they would use oxygen oxygen tanks and stuff like that to find water on the moon what are those use for ","use to like breathe or walk or you know to protect themselves from from the elements because it's really cool i guess they don't use them to find water "
11623,110.2,Oliver,,"um well you're correct they do because they're on the moon they need to be able to breathe to do their research to find the water correct yes ","yeah yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for the next class "
11625,110.2,Oliver,,,"you're welcome bye "
11628,120.4,Jazmin,,"alright so student now it's your turn can you remind me what your answer was for the question number one ","yeah so i said nasa sent small machine "
11630,120.4,Luis,,,"okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
11635,120.3,Jazmin,,"all right can you read that to me please ","nasa small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
11637,210.4,Jazmin,,"in reading that you also found that the small machine was called what ","a lunar orbiter "
11643,210.4,Jazmin,,"right and this paragraph also tells you what a lunar orbiter does can you tell me what the lunar orbiter does ","it looks i used to pause it in a large polar crater Okay well. i had always seen those two machines that the equipment was the microscope or that the machine the small machine called a lunar orbiter and i guess i was thinking about looking for ice deposits is the same as like trying to discover water cuz ice is just frozen water "
11648,110.4,Jazmin,,"awesome job Jazmin ","why why what's wrong with my answer then if i had the right answer "
11652,420.2,Farrah,,"okay okay so when you're answering so next time when we have questions make sure you're answering all parts of the question and as much detail as you can ","yeah i think there's still evidence in the text at the microscope "
11656,110.2,Farrah,,"equipment that you find whether it's in the text or you think of it in your head ","okay well i added like a longer answer than jazmin's one and i and i said the name of the equipment in mind so so why is mine wrong "
11661,150.1,Farrah,,"Do you understand that? ","how it's used to find water and it's not used to find water on the moon "
11664,420.2,Farrah,,"you explained to me that it was a piece of equipment and what it does but i wanted you to tell me how it was used to find water on the moon ","oh so i have to add that to my to my answer "
11668,230.1,Chris,,"now student your answer was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what made you think of oxygen tanks is a piece of equipment that scientists used ","okay so i know about space and i know that they can't breathe up in space and like student said you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use yeah yeah and i heard there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
11674,210.3,Luis,,"so how did they use the oxygen tanks to find water ","wow okay i guess i guess they didn't use oxygen tanks to find the water they use that to breathe air "
11676,210.3,Luis,,"right they didn't directly use that as a piece of equipment to find water like a microscope would be looking at water but in order to be on the moon like you said you need an oxygen tank because we can't breathe on the moon right ","right "
11681,210.3,Luis,,"were the scientists using oxygen tanks when they found the water ","if they're on the moon then i have to student you can't you can't be walking on the moon without an oxygen tank you can't breathe "
11684,110.2,Oliver,,"yeah absolutely good job ","oh okay teacher i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for kind of valuing all of us like i felt valued too and my answer and i'm thinking about what hearing what like i'm student needed to work on is kind of giving me an idea on how i can improve my answer to "
11687,110.2,All,,,"we are good "
11690,150.1,Luis,,"that's good that's good um so you class read a text water on the moon and we're gonna be talking about what you said like your responses ","yeah no problem um so basically i was just saying that like i kind of know like all about space so i don't think i really need to be in this "
11692,150.1,Luis,,"oh well you know class learn something new no matter how much you know about it there's always something to learn about something ","well i can stick around "
11702,420.2,Chris,,"But in the future when, if you have a little more text to it. Try to try to deepen your thinking and like kind of think of it in different way. I guess maybe thinking about it like outside of the box. You know, I have you guys heard about thinking outside the box. ","yeah what does that mean exactly "
11704,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i was just wondering what's wrong with my answer like i was trying to figure out why what i said was wrong "
11706,430.2,Jazmin,,"um well technically you weren't wrong and what you said by saying nasa send a small machine but um you could have talked about what that machine was and how it but um yeah so you weren't you weren't wrong oh it's just i'm a little too broad ","i need to say something specific because i i needed to be like a big it's a small machine and like what it's called or like what it does is that what i need to say "
11708,150.1,Jazmin,,"yes those are perfect things to add um do you have any other questions before we move on ","no that makes sense so like i should just say like in detail like what it was "
11714,110.1,Luis,,"student so you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks your responses very good and though ","Okay, well that that makes sense. Like so, like you say like more details. So like if I was gonna say equipment like I need to come up with like a few different pieces of it.Is that right? "
11717,110.1,Chris,,"yeah yeah that is correct ","oh yeah i was just gonna say goodbye to nasa so with with my dad and i saw that they use like all kinds of equipment like shooting baskets oxygen tanks all that kind of stuff "
11721,140.1,Chris,,"awesome well since you've gone there um could you think of like two things that that you saw there ","oh yeah absolutely so i saw that they use like these are core to keep them like attached to the ship if they had to do like you know what i mean like a spot and you also saw that they had these really cool like they like the food that they eat is crazy like they eat this food they like so they like put water in and then it kind of comes out like like tires "
11724,140.1,Jazmin,,"yeah i think i saw something with eggs or something i am i am i have been for the military or they both might use it but i saw something like that that that's really cool that's really cool yeah ","unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular they really wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from the text in our answers and like make sure that we didn't just like talking you know let me just say the thing that you had to back it up with evidence and also just wanted to thank you for like listening to our different interests and our stories because i think we were really interested in sharing our stories so thank you so much "
11730,220.1,Luis,,"so we're going to be discussing them and trying to expand more upon this sentences um so um i would like to just ask one other passages yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
11745,420.2,Chris,,"so yeah just maybe next time just try think of a reason why the thing that they found is important ","i was i was trying to think about the question because this the first question what equipment that scientists use to find water on the moon and i feel like i did answer it because i talked about where they found the water "
11750,110.1,Jazmin,,"excited you know class forgets once in a while even i forget i'm so we'll move on to student ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
11755,420.2,Jazmin,,"so maybe like adding a couple words to a sentence and rephrasing can really make a huge difference to the sentence ","so nasa to smell machine "
11760,130.3,Jazmin,,"new findings ","it was a long sentence but i wrote most of it "
11766,420.2,Chris,,"can help you complete the sophomore because it's not it's not a terrible thing to add an extra sentence to it, because it will help you in the long run um so um. ","sorry you were talking about equipment i remember something so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
11773,130.1,Luis,,"um so just maybe adding a couple more equipment to the sentence can help it not just bulk it up but give more understanding to follow reader who is reading a sentence ","okay okay i can add a couple more names of equipment "
11775,110.2,Oliver,,"yeah um but other than that i i thank you class like all the class i think i understood the passages like well yes that ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later "
11777,110.2,Oliver,,,"we'll see you later bye "
11779,110.2,Bennett,,,"okay i'm sending you in your chat "
11783,150.1,Luis,,"so we'll be talking about your responses to the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable um so first of all i your i like your responses all they're all different and i like that so what's what's taught was start with student so you're your ","yes i don't mean to interrupt you but i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
11785,150.1,Luis,,,"yeah i think i got all of this figured out so i'm all good now "
11788,150.1,Luis,,"oh come on stick around for a while but you can learn something new from this you know some i'm almost 20 years old and i was reading some of this and i don't even know about it ","ok ok ok "
11790,150.1,Luis,,"let's try to keep an open mind and student i feel you like this science stuff right i'm ","sorry "
11795,230.1,Farrah,,"i'm so student your your response to it was no not for a long time um what what made you say that well cuz ","in the story at the end of the story they talked about how it would take a lot of time and money for the thing to be made and it said well do you think that'll be a worth while investment or something like that do you think there will be a good investment and so i'm thinking no it's going to take that long "
11800,230.2,Farrah,,"no it's not ready yet um can you remove show me the evidence of that if you could um ","yeah i read it last story "
11802,420.2,Farrah,,"can you tell me in your own words why it's not ready using using what's in the passage but in your own words ","i'm okay okay so it says that they need to come up with a plan and making the plan that's going to take a lot of time and money and they have to build new equipment so it's that's not ready at all because that'll take a long time "
11804,110.1,Jazmin,,"good good good job i like that i like that could reply student i see your hand up ","yeah i'm still kind of confused "
11806,150.1,Jazmin,,"what do you confused about ","well cuz you said that so the answer was a good answer but my answer was completely different and and no offense but she like only wrote a few words and i wrote like a lot of words because you told us to expand our answers but they're different "
11825,150.1,Chris,,"and see how it kind of thinking more on that helped you figure that out ","i think it was what you had said before about wanting us to to just add more add more details to our writing yes yes what else i read that there could be a moon base or a base on the moon by 2024 "
11828,150.1,Chris,,,"i'd love to go to that place it would be real cool "
11834,420.2,Luis,,"Why, it would be important for the water to be able to be split into hydrogen and oxygen. ","okay well i know you can breathe oxygen and so maybe they could make like a breathing room or something and then hydrogen oh okay it says oxygen hydrogen can also be used as rocket fuel "
11838,120.4,Luis,,"i'm sorry when you say for hydrogen again while ","the story says that they can put them together oxygen and hydrogen can be used as rocket fuel "
11841,110.1,Luis,,"okay yes good way it's super important ","for you fuel which is what the as on student said that in 2024 they could have a gas station so being able to split up the hydrogen and oxygen efficiently would be very important so you can have the breathing room and then the gas station that's cool down for that "
11847,150.1,Oliver,,"and it can help you learn it better as well so i'd like to thank you class for taking the time to answer the questions as well oh ","well we want to thank you teacher for asking us questions cuz i i like how you you explain what we needed to work on adding more details but also how you asked about our thinking that led to our answers because sometimes teacher just tell us what they think we were thinking about and you asked us what we were thinking about "
11852,150.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
11860,150.1,Luis,,,"okay so hi so we're going to go ahead and repeat our answers for you so you have all that okay so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close arm yeah and i circled basically the same thing as student um i my answer was scientists found craters water on the moon and basically what i said was i was saying that nasa send a small machine yeah and what i said basically was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and you know all kinds of stuff like that "
11866,230.1,Oliver,,"what was your reason ","oh that that's a good question so okay so my reasoning was basically that okay i agree that you need a scientific tool called a microscope like that's the equipment that the scientists use that the scientists you and i think that if you can't like okay they said in the reading that the a to where did they say it exactly they said that oh yeah okay in paragraph three the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so like i know that you need a microscope to study the water "
11868,110.1,Luis,,"that's a good feedback yes you can ","um yeah so i was just gonna say like i i kind of already know like all about space and i don't really feel like i even need to be in this class "
11871,110.3,Luis,,"some final words like oxygen and you know what an oxygen tank is and you know all the equipment they use ","yeah i know all about it my dad's an astronaut "
11876,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay ","thank you i was wondering like why my answer was like why my answer was right "
11878,420.2,Jazmin,,"it was right but i wish you had a little bit more information like what was the small machine that they used ","so this small machine was called the lunar orbiter "
11880,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make more sense of how what i wanted from you student ","oh yeah i think that makes a lot more sense thank you "
11884,150.1,Chris,,,"well i was just gonna say that i never like student sets up that way basically um you know scientists like well they basically like i went to nasa so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and master too so i was wondering like why that you know i mean like where does that fit in if it's not in the meeting but we know that they "
11886,110.3,Chris,,"see you already have some background knowledge on this ","yo yeah yeah i love space "
11888,110.3,Chris,,"so you know a lot about what the scientists use on in space and what they actually use them for ","oh yeah i know like all kinds of stuff about that and i like i really know about "
11891,140.1,Farrah,,"does class here have any any knowledge on space or is it just a couple of you ","it's just a few of us i don't think class like student and student are really obsessed with space and i think they're the ones that "
11894,140.1,Farrah,,,"i think space is fine but actually i really am interested in space but for me i like science fiction "
11901,140.1,Farrah,,"is there anymore knowledge you class have yes student ","um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just really wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to use evidence from the text and like making sure that we were you were using that and then like the way when you were talking to student like you know you were basically able to like say to him like you know like what were you thinking like what was your thinking in your answer and i thought that was really cool i think you did something like that with student and that's really cool to be like asking them to think about like what you mean like what they were thinking about to thank you so much and it was really nice to meet you bye "
11904,140.1,Luis,,,"get so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to be in this class because i know that you're helping class who needed help because i already know all about space "
11906,110.1,Luis,,"is that so ","oh yeah "
11910,120.4,Farrah,,"who wants to share first ","is it okay if i go first "
11912,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay so i said and we can just go around so i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close "
11914,130.1,Farrah,,"you are correct student but not the answer is exactly looking for ","okay "
11918,210.4,Oliver,,"a microscope would not work because you need to discover the water first to use a microscope to look at the water so you actually need the lunar orbiter to find the water on the moon ","so my answer was that i circled the same as student "
11922,230.1,Oliver,,"and why did you circle the same as student ","okay so here's what i thought was i was looking for equipment right because it said what equipment did the scientists use and i thought well microscope is a piece of equipment i thought that maybe like the lunar orbiter maybe it wasn't a piece of equipment because it's a machine so i was thinking equipment was more like a tool like a hammer or like a microscope "
11926,230.3,Oliver,,"and like tool you like ","yeah that's what i knew about equipment "
11928,230.3,Oliver,,"so here's what you're using our already background knowledge on what scientists had already used for previous things correct ","yeah "
11931,230.3,Jazmin,,,"i guess i was kind of confused about why my answer was wrong "
11938,210.4,Jazmin,,"you would use a microscope to look at the sample of water that you found on the moon ","was my answer is it is so i said nasa centers small machine but was that not quite the the answer small machine oh okay that makes sense so i gotta say like what exactly is okay that makes sense "
11940,210.4,Chris,,,"sure so my response was basically that scientists craters full water on the moon "
11944,130.1,Chris,,"that is true but it's not fully insured ","oh ok so my answer was right i just said that basically there was too much water okay "
11951,130.1,Chris,,,"oh yeah i'm okay yes so i was just thinking and wondering cuz my dad took me to nasa and when i was there i saw that scientists and astronauts us all kinds of like suits and oxygen tanks and equipment other kinds so i guess i was thinking like i guess what i was wondering was like didn't they need that did they leave that out of the reading because that seems really important "
11954,130.1,Chris,,"If you were to go up to the moon you got all that equipment. ","gotcha Okay, thank you. "
11956,130.1,Luis,,,"yeah okay so what i said was that scientists use a lot of like oxygen tanks mass and stuff kind of like what harris was saying "
11960,130.1,Luis,,"as i said class else your answer is correct but it's not exactly the answer i was looking for ","gotcha so what's the background knowledge like is incorrect. "
11964,130.1,Jazmin,,"know your background knowledge is correct but he's not the answer or the way that i would have where did the answer ","i'm just gonna say unfortunately we have to go to my next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
11971,210.3,Jazmin,,"on what your answers could be changed how would you change your answers exactly based on the information that i've given you explaining a little bit more of what i was expecting from you class who'd like to go first ","okay so for me i would change my answer initially i said that like you know the the scientists use the small machine but i would make sure that i will use my evidence and say that completely answer so i would say nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to find water on the moon is that right "
11977,120.4,Chris,,"Chris, what would you change your answer to. ","so i would change my answer what i would say as i would say like um so i said initially scientists craters on the water and i would say instead that scientists found craters with small pieces of ice in that on the moon "
11979,120.4,Luis,,"Luis What would you change your answer to? ","and um so actually for me i was just gonna say that i think that i've got everything all figured out now so i was gonna say i think about good can i go back to my desk "
11987,130.1,Luis,,"because your intro wasn't exactly what we were looking for ","um so well i guess i would change my answer to um i don't know a machine so lunar orbiter. "
11990,210.3,Luis,,"yes orbiters what found the water on the moon so how would you change your answer from what you originally had ","um i would say the lunar orbiter went to the moon "
11997,120.4,Oliver,,"student and student you can go because you already went yesterday ","um okay so basically what i said okay so initially what i had said was that i circled the same as student student she has some really good ideas but also i thought the same thing as her which is that the microscope was the tool that they looked really closely and how they found the water and it sounds like there was the other things that they used to find the water and i'm still a little confused about if they use the microscope or if they use the space suits but it sounds like the answer to this question from our conversation is the lunar orbiter but i think that in the text it still says they use the microscope so it makes me think like put the microscope beyond like a second answer "
12001,410.2,Oliver,,"but the microscope cannot exactly go up to an object and find something you have to put the object you want to look at under the microscope ","gotcha so um I I read somewhere that they were going to try to build a base on the moon for 2024. do you think that they did that because they found water "
12006,120.4,Farrah,,"student do you want to share what you attend your interview ","yes so it seems like for me okay so originally i said that that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and what i meant by that when i was thinking about my answer like i meant that because it says in the in the text that the water is just like little microscopic ice crystals so i thought how can you find if you can see that so i guess the lunar orbiter like that that that makes sense that that's the machine at a sense and it was looking like maybe the lunar orbiter had a microscope on it like how could you find the microscopic water if you couldn't see it "
12019,120.4,Jazmin,,"student do you want to say some things i know you add years before ","so actually fortunately it's time for us to the lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to help you for a while i wanted to thank you for helping us understand some of the misconceptions that we like you really helped us to understand like you know the meaning of the kind of words especially around discover like when you were saying like what we needed to focus on the question i think that was really like helpful because like words like discover yeah like i think class like thought that that was really helpful because it helps us to figure out like what to look for you know what i mean like it's not always obvious like what we should be looking for in you know in the thing so i think it really helped us to understand like the word we should look for and you also encouraged us to make sure that we use evidence so you know what i mean like we we couldn't give an answer that didn't have evidence from the text and i think that was really good practice for us to thank you so much "
12023,150.1,Farrah,,"hi class did you enjoy reading ","yes we enjoyed it and we're ready to share our answers awesome basically ok so my answer what do you want to give us to give it one by one or do you want to call on us how would you like "
12029,120.4,Luis,,"why don't we go around the table so student you can start and then it will be oliveron student and so on ","sounds good okay you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really close and i basically circle the same thing as student scientist scientists don't printers for water and i said a small machine and scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks stuff like that "
12036,420.2,Farrah,,"but i also think maybe next time and your responses you could give us a little bit more of a personalized approach to your response so maybe what you found from the text along with what you thought about it does that sound good ","yeah so like what my opinion on what i thought Okay I can do that. "
12039,420.2,Oliver,,"but like i said to her maybe personalize it a little bit add your own views sound good ","okay yeah "
12043,430.2,Chris,,"but we weren't didn't pull anything directly from the text like a quote so do you think maybe next time we could look back into the text and add a quote or something to directly ","reach every rader yeah i can totally do that "
12047,310.1,Jazmin,,"and student i think you had some great vocab ","actually my my answer was well "
12050,310.1,Jazmin,,,"oh i was just trying to figure out like why my answer was wrong "
12055,230.2,Jazmin,,"So the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. And you talked about that NASA send something. Is there a place in the text where you found that Jazmin. ","yeah basically i saw that in paragraph two nasa send a small machine or better to investigate "
12059,230.2,Luis,,,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that like i already know all about space like i don't think i need any help "
12061,150.1,Luis,,"you know i think it's awesome that you already have so much knowledge but nobody can know everything about one thing so the more we learn the better off we might be so maybe we should just keep our minds open to what's going on and maybe we can learn from it okay ","okay "
12063,150.1,Chris,,,"oh i was just gonna say i know because i've been to nasa that up you know scientists like us a lot of like oxygen tanks and masks stuff like that you know what i mean "
12067,420.2,Jazmin,,"thank you so student like we were saying i think you had a really good response just maybe go the next step read a little bit further and then add to your answer before you respond okay ","okay "
12071,420.3,Luis,,"but in this particular text we're learning about one specific thing so maybe next time if we can look back into the text and pull something directly from there along with your personal opinion we'd have a stronger response is that okay ","um yeah i guess i'm trying to figure out which the thing is because there's so many pieces that go into the spaceship you know so i'm i'm trying to figure out like which one it is "
12074,110.3,Luis,,"and also if we continue our readings outside of class we can learn a little bit more like you said you know a lot about space so the more we continue reading about it the more we can learn about it okay ","Yeah, okay. "
12077,110.3,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately it's time much so we have to go but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us and in particular i really wanted to thank you for drawing our attention to you know to me and asking us to share our thoughts like i was really glad to be able to share my thoughts out so thank you so much for working "
12082,110.3,Oliver,,,"what you'd like us to say them or or do you remember that "
12085,230.2,Luis,,"so now i'm going to ask you each question and that question is where can you reference the test the text from your answer and how does it answer the question do you have a question student ","um yeah so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like all about space "
12087,150.1,Luis,,"that's awesome that you know a lot about space but there's infinite learning that we can have none of us know absolutely everything is because none of us have been to space i don't think have you been ","no not yet but i will "
12093,230.2,Luis,,"the questions that i'm asking you is in your answer where can you refer to the text so where did you get your answer from in the text ","um so i didn't really need to read it because i already knew the answer because i know a lot about space so i knew already that that scientists had to use that "
12098,230.2,Jazmin,,"thank you alright student so nasa sent a small machine where did you find that in the text ","so basically what i was thinking that it was in the second paragraph and they were talking about the end of the machine "
12101,210.3,Jazmin,,"so the question asking what equipment did scientists use so is there any way you think that you could expand on your answer yes student ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong even though you say we really want to expand "
12104,420.2,Jazmin,,"your answer is not necessarily wrong i just think we could expand on it further so if you could look back in the text and see exactly where you have your answer so in paragraph two is there any more knowledge that you can add to your answer now ","well it says that its looking for ice sheets is that what it's supposed to be "
12110,230.2,Jazmin,,"all right awesome thank you alright student so your answer scientists found craters full of water on the moon where did you find that in the chat ","oh ok so i saw that i'm excited the first paragraph it they were talking about the yeah the craters and how there was all the water you know "
12113,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah so let me ask you now how does that answer what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon ","oh well that's where they discovered the water "
12119,210.3,Oliver,,"Okay awesome alright Oliver so your answer was just circling the same as Farrah is there any more in depth that you'd like to go and your answer. ","student is usually right and i also thought that too "
12124,230.2,Farrah,,"all right thank you so student where did you find your answer in the text ","so i was looking for and the only equipment that i could find it pretty three paragraphs with me and i thought it was a like you know how are our test as like the kind of trick questions and it says what and you have to find that exact i was like what and i thought oh the bikers right so even though i wasn't quite sure about like how it works i figured the microscope had to be "
12128,130.1,Chris,,"wide range you could have multiple answers like how student said they use the machine to get there well they couldn't find the water if they didn't get there right so they use the machine and they use the microscope excuse me yes student ","um i i actually saw like a spaceship one time "
12133,520.1,Farrah,,"so next time you are answering a question like this how do you think you can make your answer better ","unfortunately we have to go too much but thank you so much for people it was really fun thank you so much bye "
12137,150.1,Luis,,"alright so i believe we left off the savanna talking about the microscope being the only thing i'm sorry student how can i help you ","oh well i just was off i was gonna say that like i think i got everything figured out now so i think i'm all good to go "
12141,150.1,Luis,,"let's just keep listening to our classmates make sure we're all respectful to each other and let's keep our hands down until i come to you okay unless you have a serious question ","okay "
12146,210.3,Farrah,,"but since we've kind of brought in our knowledge now about how it takes time and equipment to get to space to find the water how can we brought in our answer ","oh well i use it sure cuz when i think of equipment i just think of like a wrench or hamper you know like that equipment right so a microscope like maybe like fancy equipment but it still don't see any other equipment you know look that up "
12150,210.2,Farrah,,"and that's okay um if we think back to jazmin's response she talked about the spaceship and if you think about it equipment can be anything that you really use to get to the water ","Oh. like a robot "
12154,230.2,Farrah,,"let's see where where did you find that in the text ","oh no no sorry i was thinking about like what would be like oh so the lunar orbiter is like you would use and i guess they had a robot but no they just use the lunar orbiter "
12159,130.2,,,"so student is there anything you'd like to add to that now that we've looked through the text and if you want to review it again see if there's anything else or add ","i think samantha's right "
12162,230.2,,,"yeah i totally agree do you want to point out exactly where in the text she found the answers for us ","um well i think it was next to the robot part "
12166,230.2,,,"can you find it for me because i don't think that we had a robot part in there but that's okay ","yeah okay i see it "
12172,110.1,Jazmin,,"alright so we'll come right back to you student how can i help you ","well i guess it's just what is the leader is that like you that's equipment like it too "
12177,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense. ","yeah "
12184,230.2,Oliver,,"awesome alright so student where did you find the information about microscope and the text ","okay so when i was looking at it you know more seriously i saw that that they had like that they were using the microscope to look at the release small like particles of water and so that's kind of like why i thought that might have been cool as well and then i actually do understand like how student was say like that the lunar orbiter is also a piece of equipment because just like semana like i only saw the microscope i didn't think that the lunar orbiter was really like equipment the same way that like you know she was saying you know like a screwdriver or like you know something like that seems different so i kind of had the same thing she did "
12186,130.2,Chris,,"Now Chris, now that we've heard everyone else's responses, do you have anything to reflect on or add about what you've heard and how this equipment was used to get to find the water on the moon. ","yeah i guess so i i think like i read that there could be a base on the moon by maybe 20 or that made me think that you know like i don't know like it made me think that this is something that could make that possible "
12192,420.3,Luis,,"Information in the text, maybe we could look for some harder words in the text so spacecraft stuff like that and reflect that on to these answers, do you think you can do that for me. ","oh i maybe i kind of feel like i don't know i feel like the stuff well i kind of feel like i don't really understand why they wouldn't like if they have all those astronauts they would have to use oxygen so i think my answer was still pretty right "
12198,420.3,Oliver,,"so if you can reflect on your texts for me and find some bigger words harder words that maybe you didn't understand and we can go over them to help you better understand the text ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i wanted to thank you for really hoping to sort of value the answers that we had and then like helping a lot of us sort of work through like our fusion and like also you really had us focus on using evidence which was pretty cool because that made sure that we were able to tell you like why we thought what we were thinking and like why we had our answer which was pretty cool so thank you so much it was really fun "
12202,420.3,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12221,420.3,Jazmin,,"so that was good but next time i want you to dive deeper into story and think about what they used to discover the water ","okay i guess i thought that what i wrote i was what they used to discover the water Okay, I'm looking. the water they found was microscopic The water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking at it closely. NASA sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate lunar orbiter when the moon South Pole and look for ice deposits in a large public crater. these ice deposits are very small scientists said the one top of the top layer of the surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about one one person might drink in a day I'll let me read it again. teacher i think my answer from paragraph two but i don't understand why my answers wrong "
12226,420.2,Jazmin,,"you just needed to go a little further to name the machine they use but so far so good ","okay okay "
12229,210.3,Farrah,,"now student did you see where it said the equipment ","is i guess the one that student said the nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
12231,210.4,Farrah,,"so you see how that was the equipment they used to discover the water and then the microscope was the equipment they used to go closer and see if the water was sufficient ","well i mean i see where it's at that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater but i guess i didn't i didn't it doesn't look like they found water in there "
12236,420.2,Oliver,,"so you're adding on to discussion or adding your own opinion to it ","but but i mean i had the same answer you just asked her how first so when it was my turn it was just the same thing "
12240,420.2,Oliver,,"Or if  you disagree or anything. Just adding on to the discussion. So we're not all saying the same things. ","okay "
12242,420.2,Chris,,,"went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12251,420.3,Oliver,,"next time i just want you to get a closer look into the text and think deeper about the question ","okay okay it's time for us to go to lunch but and i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think about how i should kind of give my own ideas i mean it's not like i copied off student but maybe you how i always want to add on a new idea or more more things if somebody else has the same idea as me "
12255,150.1,Luis,,"okay so to start off class had a great start answering the questions um ","i'm gap so i was just gonna say that i don't think i need to even be in this room because i already know all about space and all this kind of stuff ready "
12263,110.1,Farrah,,"when you said the tool the scientists needed for water was a small microscope um ","So, like how they found even I mean like today yeah cuz I thought the. the microscope you through the microscope really close "
12265,420.2,Farrah,,"My suggestion would be to look at the passage the paragraph before it, where it stated the the equipment they use to find the water in the first place before they could even look into it with the microscope they use something else to find the water so my suggestion would be to add that and then revise your response. ","okay "
12269,210.3,Oliver,,"and i would like you to just dive a little deeper and either add on or revise your statement to like either add on or say something different to what student said so is there anything you wanted to add on ","um well i guess what i was thinking about was kind of a same thing that they used a microscope to look really closely because i was thinking like if you're gonna see the water like the ice crystals they're really small and so i was thinking like that's the only way to see that "
12277,430.2,Jazmin,,"was almost there but then quite fully answer the question so next time if you're going to add like just add on something extra ","like like i guess i wasn't sure in this class you're helping us because we weren't quite right it is still kind of confused like why my answer was wrong "
12279,420.2,Jazmin,,"it actually wasn't wrong and i see where you answered your question i just wanted you to be a little more specific of what the equipment was called so you had a good start and you were almost there you just needed to name the equipment so you you were on the right track ","i know the equipment can i say it "
12281,420.2,Jazmin,,,"so the small machine it was the lunar oriber right "
12284,420.2,Jazmin,,"yes that is correct so you just needed you were on the right track you just needed to name the object so for next time when you're given a response make sure you're as specific as possible but you had a great start ","in that makes sense that it was like i just tend to be more specific like see what it what "
12286,420.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you that makes a lot of sense "
12290,420.2,Chris,,,"so i was also going to say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that "
12295,420.3,Chris,,"To see the exact equipment they used. ","gotcha okay yeah I can look close. "
12305,150.1,Chris,,"so just basically look closer and it stated in the text but you just need to read it thoroughly to answer the question you had a great start ","okay yeah i can look more closely and see what what else is going on because yeah i was just connecting to what i already do but i think i see what you're saying like i need to i need to look at the paper look at the reading and my kind of pull it from from there as well right now ok cool thank you "
12307,150.1,Luis,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us this was really fun thank you "
12312,520.1,Luis,,"so we can start with student and just to repeat i want you to state how you started out thinking how the strategy you used changed based on the feedback i gave and what you will do next time to make sure you are fully answering the question ","um well i was gonna say i'm excited to share because i think i got it all figured out so i'm all good "
12319,510.1,Luis,,"What do you think you can include after using a background knowledge to answer your question so after you use your background knowledge, what do you think what strategy, do you think you can use to help promote learning and answering the question. ","so i thought like i was thinking about what you were saying and you were telling me like i needed to look more closely at the reading and not just not just use my background knowledge so you know like it was an interesting question you know like what equipment do they use and so i was saying like oh they use like oxygen tanks and stuff which i do but then when i look at paragraph two i realized that the equipment maybe that they were really focused on was the lunar orbit and and then in paragraph three was the microscope so it looks like maybe i can read more closely in the um you know what i mean like in the reading to understand like what i'm trying to answer "
12323,520.1,Jazmin,,"we're just going to go around student what do you think first you're going to say what strategy you used and how you will build on to it for your next assignment or task ","so for me what i noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete so like what i needed to do was make sure that well a that i was like saying like you know not just this small machine but like what this machine was and if i didn't say that theni didn't really answer the question because they were asking like what equipment and i just said small machine i didn't say like lunar orbiter you know what i mean "
12326,120.4,Jazmin,,"student ","can i ask a quick question "
12329,120.4,Jazmin,,,"so i guess i was partially still a little confused only on one section and so i understand why this woman she like the lunar orbiter was what they used to discover the water and i was wondering like if they use the microscope as well you know like student and oliver's answer like it seems like that might be an answer and i guess i was confused like why that might not be the right answer "
12332,210.4,Jazmin,,"and the microscope after they found the water they use a microscope to look closely at it so the microscope help them to see the water better but it didn't help them find the water ","makes perfect sense thank you so much okay that makes sense i'm not confused "
12336,120.4,Chris,,"student what about you ","um i think for me like what i noticed is like kind of similar to like i i bring a lot of my like background knowledge because i know all about this stuff but i wasn't reading as closely about the question because i was saying like you're saying this craters full of water moon and they use oxygen tanks and stuff like that but they didn't i didn't say really the answer i said like that they found the craters and then they use this other stuff but i didn't really say like what it meant that they fought with just what you've been pointing out to class so i think that that's why my answer was incomplete "
12342,120.4,Oliver,,"Oliver What about you? ","i'm so actually i understood a lot so i was thinking about it and then when you were talking to student and jasper it really made me think that like i'm i understand now that like when i said that they use the microscope just like the statement survey and i said i realized that they did use it but first they had to find it so i didn't read the question as closely as i could but what you pointed out was that i needed to read it closely and understand what they were asking "
12349,150.1,Oliver,,"always you class want to always build on each other's thoughts so even though if you agree or if you have the same thought you have to think of a way that you could either add on or ask questions ","so i i read that they weren't going to try to build a moon base on the moon by like 2024 and it was just making me think like the questions always make me think of other things so i was wondering like when when should i bring in that like that knowledge and question like you know what i mean like because that seems like that would use a lot of equipment but i guess i guess it's not answering the question is that right "
12352,420.1,Oliver,,"But we want to focus on exactly what the question is asking us, so we can answer it completely. ","Okay. "
12360,520.1,Farrah,,"and last but not least student what about you what do you think what strategy did you use and how will you take that to either build on or change it in the future ","so i started by saying that it was the microscope that they found the water with because i was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it they couldn't find it but when i read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water then they studied it using the microphone so that's that's pretty cool and where it makes me think like going forward is that i need to think really closely about what it's asking because sometimes like when we take our our leap test it always is hard for me to know like some of the tricky answers like they asked like what's the best answer and i think i'm understanding that there's like you can still see an answer and it still is connected but like what's the best answer and it seems like the best answer was the lunar orbiter like you were saying the student because that's the best answer that says like how did they find it like maybe they proved it with the microscope and they sort of found it but like what did they do to even find that it was there like they didn't have a microscope like i thought there was an astronaut but with a magnifying glass on the moon but that's not at all what it was like they had a little machine so i think what i would do is read really closely and try to understand like what what they're asking "
12366,150.1,Farrah,,"exactly these are all great reflections and for the next text you can always think back to this and see how to build on ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go i really wanted to thank you for a couple things that are really important in this class so like one thing that was really important as you help us understand our use evidence better so you really helped us to use evidence like in our answers so that we weren't just using background knowledge and also you have this there you know by by asking us what we were thinking that led to our answers you helped us understand like what we were doing right and maybe what we could do better and you also were so patient you let us explain our ideas and like you didn't interrupt this what we were trying to to understand and that made us feel really valued right class "
12371,150.1,Farrah,,,"i felt really valued so i just wanted to share that that was something that up and then finally you also like give us your concerns so you let us know like exactly what we could work on which helped us because rather than saying like oh you need to just work on your answer you were like we think about like what you're saying think about what's be asked and then give your answer so that like helped us to have a much better set of answers thank you so much that was really fun working with you "
12373,150.1,Luis,,,"i'm good "
12376,150.1,Luis,,"good awesome job awesome alright so um we remember the other day we read the text water on the moon do we remember reading that yeah awesome so the reason that we are meeting today is because we're going to try to work on your responses class did a great job yeah yeah student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12378,220.1,Luis,,"i know that you know all about space but this isn't about learning about space it's about we're going to work on creating better responses when we read texts does that makes sense ","oh yeah yeah ok "
12385,150.1,Farrah,,"Does that make sense. ","yeah we talked about we use a microscope in science class "
12394,420.2,Jazmin,,"response is you want to say scientists discovered water on the moon by using blank equipment ","well i don't understand why my answers wrong because i did use one of the equipment "
12398,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","so after i have to write more stuff "
12408,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","okay it does it was just that it was exactly the same because she circled the last sentence and i circled the last sentence too "
12410,150.1,Oliver,,"and even if you circle the last sentence i still want you to say something it's for good participation and i want to make sure class says their answer ","okay "
12417,110.1,Farrah,,"okay so in order to do that like in your response you you said they use the scientific tool called the microscope awesome awesome awesome job ","So, i guess kind of like student i have to add more words "
12420,110.1,Farrah,,,"or i have to change my answer "
12422,420.2,Chris,,"You want to make sure that - it's all about being specific. You want to use good examples from the text. ","reach every readers i went to nasa "
12426,140.1,Chris,,"you went to nasa really ","yeah with my dad i went to nasa so i do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits yeah they they they need a lot of equipment to go to the moon "
12436,410.1,Oliver,,"the question asked for you to talk about the equipment ","um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really do appreciate how you helped us to think about using more evidence from the text in our answers bye "
12442,220.1,Luis,,"so we're here because i have concerns about each one of your guys's responses to the water on the moon passage and we're going to work on improving them yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i know all about space "
12459,210.2,Jazmin,,"and then look for equipment that helped to discover water so those are your keywords ","excuse me teacher i was looking and i still don't understand why my answer's wrong "
12472,420.2,Chris,,"so i would love if you go back reread the question and then go to the passage and come up with your own answer because i want to know your own ideas and thoughts for the answer ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12474,210.3,Jazmin,,"Has everyone had a chance to reread the question in the passage? ","yeah "
12477,210.3,Jazmin,,,"okay well you told me that i have to be more specific so i have nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
12482,110.4,Oliver,,"which is good awesome which shows that you now the equipment that was used was the lunar orbiter to help discover the water on the moon awesome student yes ","sorry to interrupt i was just looking at the time and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later "
12491,230.3,Luis,,"so i have a specific little notes for each of you so let me start off with student student you said no not for a long time for the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon can be valuable so student yes ","okay i think i got it now and i'm all good yeah "
12494,110.1,Luis,,"okay well give me one minute i'll keep i'm going to tell student what i want her to do and then i'm going to come to you ","ok "
12501,210.2,Farrah,,"so the word evidence what is it what is evidence can you tell me what evidence is ","it's like facts "
12504,120.4,Chris,,"can class tell me ","valuable means like has a lot of value "
12506,120.4,Luis,,,"like it's worth a lot of money like money "
12512,210.2,Jazmin,,"let's rework the question just a little bit so it can be easier to understand because there are some big words in there like evidence and valuable so are there facts or information that say that water on the moon can be helpful to us ","i think i did that so i don't know why my answers wrong "
12524,230.3,Chris,,"so, as I was just saying to Jazmin she said that for in the future astronauts can. ","I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
12527,230.2,Chris,,"really i didn't know is that did you get that from the passage ","no no me and my dad have been reading about aviation and we went to nasa and i read that maybe they could put some a base up there so it'll make things easier "
12529,110.1,Chris,,"so going to you i'll go to you next and then Oliver, I can talk to you. ","yeah yeah "
12538,120.1,Oliver,,"it's almost there you're almost there but you just need to reread the question and reread the passage because there is more information that you can use to include student what's up it's your turn ","yeah well i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go but i was listening to what you're telling class else and i think you did help me think about if i'm answering the question and to try to find all the evidence and the answer yeah I think I think I know that that's what I need to do. "
12542,220.1,Luis,,"hi class so today i heard you read water on the moon is that correct class did class read yes ok so i want to revise our answers because i saw you had an understanding of it but i didn't see that you had a deep deep understanding so we're going to try to fix that today so i want one yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12545,120.4,Oliver,,"so i want student to go first and i want him to remind me of what his answer was ","yeah sure ok so i circle the last sentence in the text you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
12548,210.4,Oliver,,"but i want you to look i want class to look on paragraph 2 where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small ","well i'm thinking because you're asking that maybe it does "
12550,210.4,Oliver,,"i want someone to tell me what the machine it's referencing to ","the machine is the lunar orbiter "
12552,130.2,Chris,,"student let's have class look first before you share class besides class else student what did you come up with ","in that paragraph two it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
12554,150.1,Chris,,"so would you think that would be a form of equipment used by nasa ","yeah because a machine is equipment "
12556,120.1,Jazmin,,"so i want someone else to answer my question again previously what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and i want someone to revise their answer from last time so student do you want to try ","well i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
12558,110.1,Jazmin,,"ok well if you think your if you had the answer then someone else who didn't have that answer want to try again ","ok "
12560,130.2,Luis,,"good job for knowing the answer class else want to try student do you want to go yeah go ahead ","so i feel like the answer is lunar orbiter "
12562,230.2,Luis,,"ok now i want you to give me specific detail from the text about why you think it's lunar orbiter ","ok so it says that nasa's sent a small machine called a lunar orbit well i mean and you told us to look at this paragraph so "
12564,210.4,Luis,,"what does it do though so what does the machine do ","it investigates "
12568,210.4,Farrah,,"what does it investigate ","lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits in a large polar Oh, yeah, right. Oh, yeah, because ice is just frozen water. "
12571,210.4,Oliver,,"can class understand that ice deposit is water they're looking for does class agree with that ","yeah i wasn't thinking about that i was just looking for the word water and i didn't even think about the fact that oh yeah like you said today and ice and water is the same "
12575,420.2,Luis,,"So going back to what Luis said again, Luis, if you want to try to finish your statement because you're on the right track that the lunar orbiter is a small machine. But what does it do? To answer the question in context. ","it look and looks for ice deposits Frozen-- frozen water. Yeah, frozen water. "
12577,210.3,Luis,,"so what is the overall goal with this machine i want you to say it in one complete sentence for me ","ok so the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit "
12579,110.4,Luis,,"yep ","and ice deposits are frozen water "
12581,110.4,Luis,,"yes so that is the equipment ","oh yeah yeah "
12583,110.4,Chris,,,"i know i know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and "
12590,120.1,Farrah,,"does class else want to try the question again besides student that thought maybe their answer wasn't up to par from last time maybe student do you want to try it student do you want to try ok ","i'll try ok so the lunar orbiter sends the lunar orbiter OK. NASA sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter-- OK, OK, OK. OK. The lunar orbiter-- the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits. "
12592,120.1,Farrah,,,"ok "
12594,210.4,Farrah,,"and what are the ice deposits ","they're very small oh ice ice deposits are frozen water "
12597,210.4,Farrah,,"and so they use that equipment to what ","to find them to investigate to investigate "
12601,210.4,Oliver,,"to investigate what ","the ice deposits I don't have any questions but I did look at the clock and I see that it's time for us to go to lunch. "
12603,210.4,Oliver,,,"oh you're welcome i wanted to say thank you for really helping me to think more about how to find more evidence in the story to put in my answer so thank you for that "
12611,150.1,Jazmin,,"is class done ","yeah "
12613,120.4,Farrah,,"ok so what keywords did class circle ","i circled equipment and water "
12616,120.1,Jazmin,,"okay what else ","i circled water and moon i circled equipment "
12624,210.2,Luis,,"does class know why discover would also be an important word in the question ","because it's an action word What equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon? Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space. "
12630,120.4,Oliver,,"student you can go first ","i circled ah microscope "
12632,110.1,Farrah,,"microscope ok ","i circle microscope too so i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
12636,130.2,Jazmin,,"class else ","i circled two i circled small machine and lunar orbiter "
12638,120.3,Luis,,"so that's correct so now we're going to reflect on what student shared there so i want class to look at lunar orbiter and read the first and second sentence of paragraph two class want to read out loud the first second sentence of a paragraph about the lunar orbiter ","i'll read it i'll read it ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
12642,210.4,Oliver,,"Have a guess what is deposits are? ","oh maybe like ice that gets put down somewhere "
12647,120.4,Farrah,,"Go ahead. ","ice is frozen water "
12652,210.4,Chris,,"ice is frozen water so ice so ice and water on the same thing they're both water just in different forms so going back to what student said earlier nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that is a type of equipment ","well i'm sorry to interrupt but it just made me think of something yeah so i went to nasa and so i saw that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and mask and suits "
12665,130.2,Jazmin,,"so i want to get into some small groups really quickly so i'm going to put with student and student and then student student student are going to work together and i want you to compare and contrast the difference between the lunar orbiter and microscope ","Okay um so. i have a lunar orbiter as my answer okay yeah i didn't have that one i'll look at all the paragraph three again the water they found is microscopic you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay so that's pretty much easy you know you use a microscope to look really closely okay and then for the lunar orbiter thing it says the lunar orbiter will look for ice deposits so they're both looking for things okay and well it says that the lunar orbiter okay so they both look for things and it says that the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater and the microscope looks really closely at water i mean i guess that's different except it's also the same "
12672,210.4,Oliver,,"but the way it's written in paragraph two they first use a lunar orbiter to look for the water then they use a microscope ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but it's time for us to go so okay love to finish later "
12678,220.1,Luis,,"class had a good understanding of the reading but i do want to work out answers just a little bit because i think we're getting a little confused between two big aspects so first before we share our answers with the class i want you to independently for one minute look at the question ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12683,210.3,Farrah,,"does class want to share what words they circled ","i circled equipment and water "
12685,210.3,Oliver,,"okay student what did you circle ","i circled the same thing i circled equipment and water "
12688,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay class else any other words ","well okay i guess it's the same thing i circled equipment "
12690,210.3,Luis,,"you only circled water what about you student you're one who hasn't shared yet what did you circle ","i circled equipment and the moon "
12692,210.3,Jazmin,,,"i forgot i thought that i only circled equipment but i actually circled equipment and scientists "
12701,130.2,Jazmin,,"i want you to do this with a with a small class so student and student can do it together and student student student can also be a small class and i want you to circle any equipment you see in the reading that you think is important and then i want you come back in one minute ","okay um so the first one that i see is the small machine teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
12720,130.2,Chris,,"i'm not saying any answer's wrong right now i just want you to collaborate with your peers because they all have different answers then you so i want you to collaborate with them okay thank you for the question ","ok all what do you see ok well student i see a small machine that's equipment okay i'll circle that one ok class i'm going to circle small machine like student said they've got microscope in here that's equipment okay i'll circle that too reach every reader okay we're done yeah well, I mean, I think that microscope is like small. well a small machine could be small too ok then they're the same well they could be the same they could be the same Well, no, it says on the small machine is called a lunar orbiter. It said that the lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposits. you know what teacher i was i went to nasa and i know that scientists used a whole bunch of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12722,410.1,Jazmin,,"Yeah that is correct, but that's what they wear. We're looking at when they used to find the water. ","ice is frozen water "
12726,210.4,Oliver,,"ice is frozen water and ice and water are the same thing because they're both water and from what we know in the reading the small machine called the lunar orbiter is finding ice deposits which are really what are they really ","they're really small Oh, they're water. They're water. "
12729,210.4,Luis,,"what does the microscope do ","we use the microscope you know to look at really small things in science class "
12732,210.4,Farrah,,"what are they using the microscope for in this reading ","i wrote this one in my answer they're using the microscope to look really closely at the water "
12735,210.4,Oliver,,"so what are they using to find the water ","they're using the lunar orbiter to find the water "
12738,210.3,Oliver,,"so what is the answer to our question ","scientists used the lunar orbiter to find water on the moon "
12743,130.3,Oliver,,"that is that is correct so the reason why we did this was because people were thinking the microscope is what we were using to find the water but in reality it was because we're using the small machine the lunar orbiter to find water does class have any questions about that ","no no and i i was i just want to say aw thanks teacher it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to thank you for when you when you kind of helped us keep looking at the story and thinking about what the meanings of the words are i think that kind of helped me to think about the answer okay bye "
12746,150.1,Luis,,"hey class i'm so i just heard your great responses i just wanted to touch base and maybe see if we can get a deeper understanding we have a great start but we there's a couple pieces were missing so can we work together to do that yeah ","yes excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12748,150.1,Luis,,"okay well i pulled you aside because me as the teacher i saw that maybe we could all help each other get a deeper understanding of space ","okay "
12750,150.1,Luis,,"that makes sense ","i guess "
12753,150.1,Luis,,"does that make sense ","um maybe i think "
12755,150.1,Farrah,,,"no i don't like "
12761,410.2,Farrah,,"what they were looking at so what were they looking at closely ","water "
12763,420.2,Farrah,,"Could really just push through your answer. That makes sense. ","so i just got to add at the water all my all my sentence "
12767,420.2,Farrah,,"just make sure when you're writing answers like this you need to be very clear about the what and the why so you had part of the what you just needed the second piece ","okay "
12769,110.1,Oliver,,"and student you said you circled the same as student ","uh huh "
12771,230.1,Oliver,,"can you explain what that means ","when she read her answer she had circled the last sentence i'm an animal story and i i circled the last sentence and the story to "
12777,230.1,Oliver,,"why did you circle the last sentence ","on cars well though the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for like an equipment and and i saw the microscope and i know that that's equipment of course we use it in science class Um, well, I think I understand that. i think so "
12779,150.1,Oliver,,"i didn't see you didn't i just want to make sure that we're on the same page ","oh "
12783,150.1,Jazmin,,"again just make sure you have all those pieces yes student i'm sorry i see your hand what's up ","i don't understand why my my answers wrong "
12787,130.1,Jazmin,,"so you're on the right path you just need a bit more so that makes sense ","oh yeah "
12791,130.1,Jazmin,,,"um i guess i don't know what more just write more words "
12797,210.4,Jazmin,,"what was the machine called look back to the reading ","the lunar orbiter "
12803,210.4,Jazmin,,"they sent a lunar orbiter to look for something in the craters what were they looking for ","deposits to look for ice deposit and a large crater "
12818,210.4,Jazmin,,"So like the Lunar Orbiter. OK. ","just at the name You say, i need more details Okay, okay. "
12820,210.4,Chris,,,"no problem i just wanted to tell you that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and lots of other stuff to "
12825,110.1,Chris,,"they do use a lot of other stuff like that um so your answer you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon ","I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter. "
12827,210.4,Chris,,"So what does it say in the second paragraph. ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater these ice deposits are very small scientists say one of the top layer of the moon surface will hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
12832,210.4,Oliver,,"what kind of equipment was used ","i'm sorry to interrupt i'm teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch um i know it was a really short time but i did appreciate how are you you asked us to a look more at the text to add more evidence from the text tool to our answers thank you for that "
12834,210.4,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
12838,210.4,Farrah,,,"yes okay can you hear us "
12840,210.4,Farrah,,,"great we're excited to work with you today "
12843,120.2,Luis,,"so we're going to focus on the question what do a quick what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ","i'm excuse me i should be and best class i already know all about space "
12846,110.3,Luis,,"and then by the end you probably could teach me something about space ","yeah sounds good "
12851,120.4,Jazmin,,"all right perfect which student wants to speak out first about what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon student ","i said nasa centers small machine "
12853,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay so what made you say that why did you say that ","well i said because there's a sentence at the beginning of part two that says that "
12858,420.2,Jazmin,,"but we need to be a little more detailed ","they needed it to investigate the craters "
12861,120.3,Farrah,,"the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely student ","um yeah so i sent a microscope that was my answer um so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
12866,150.1,Farrah,,"that makes sense ","yeah i just don't know what to add "
12868,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah so what did you said your answer was what can you tell me again ","yeah my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
12872,130.2,Jazmin,,"do you class know what did nasa send to help investigate student ","they sent the small machine "
12874,210.3,Luis,,"yeah what was it called ","i know "
12876,120.2,Luis,,"who was that student what is it called ","lunar orbiter "
12879,210.4,Luis,,"what do we know about the water ","no it's too small "
12886,210.3,Oliver,,"so can someone new share out what our new sentence could be that helps answer this question in a lot of detail ","i'll try okay um so for the equipment the scientists used the machine called the lunar orbiter and a microscope "
12890,210.3,Chris,,,"well so i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
12893,120.2,Luis,,"so you class now that we've gone over this again and really dove into this material and answered the question and looked at it in different views can you class understand do you class understand what was used what scientists used student ","i'm sorry yeah i mean they use the orbiter and they use a microscope but i also know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for water and definitely using oxygen tanks so i think chris's right "
12895,110.3,Luis,,"no okay well see i told you we're going to teach me something about space that i didn't know and there it is nice job ","so we could say like all of the equipment for the answer "
12897,230.1,Luis,,"you could say can you explain what you mean ","yeah so i could say lunar orbiter and microscope and oxygen tanks and masks on suits "
12900,120.2,Luis,,"so yes they did use masks and suits and oxygen tanks but to discover water on the moon remember what they used ","just the orbiter and the microscope "
12903,210.3,Oliver,,"so do you see how they're a little different so while they did use the things that we talked about suits and mass and oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon they only use a lunar orbiter and a microscope ","i'm really sorry but we have to go now "
12908,120.3,Luis,,"so before we share our responses and possibly revise and change them i want you class to reread and look at the paragraph four five and six in your reading once you class are done we can look at we can keep going with this lesson ","um excuse me "
12910,120.3,Luis,,,"um i think i got this all figured out saw on god "
12915,120.4,Luis,,"so i'm going to ask you to look at i'm going to have you told me your answer ","okay you want me to say it now okay um my answer is water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and that is right from the story "
12918,230.2,Luis,,"listen can you show me where you found that can you tell me where you ","paragraph five agile oxygen hydrogen can also be used "
12921,210.2,Luis,,"okay so i see where you're coming from but let's think about this a little differently we're trying to see is there convincing evidence that it be valuable do you know what the word valuable means ","like important "
12924,120.3,Luis,,"what i want you class to do is to look at that reading one more time ","okay "
12927,210.4,Jazmin,,"perfect alright can one of my friends tell me in the first paragraph in paragraph four in that sentence there's something that tells us about why the water having it there could be important can someone tell me why it could be valuable that the water is already on the moon ","oh well and they drink "
12930,210.3,Chris,,"they could drink it yeah so if astronauts right now it's something about the water there what do we know is the water light or heavy ","on it's heavy and that was my answer oh they don't have to carry the heavy water in the ships if it's already on the moon "
12933,230.3,Farrah,,"exactly so that's one of our possible answers that could be one reason why it could be valuable is that it's heavy so if it's already there they already have access to it and they don't need to worry about bringing it to the moon student ","i i'm kind of confused "
12935,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah what are you confused about telling me ","well my answer is that i'm there it's not ready it won't be ready for a long time "
12937,230.1,Farrah,,"what won't be ready ","the water on the moon "
12939,230.2,Farrah,,"so be ready what made you choose that answer can you tell me the evidence that you had from the book that made you think that ","yeah um so like the last part of part six it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i don't think it's that valuable "
12944,430.3,Farrah,,"so student can you look back at your text and find me one piece of evidence that tells us why it is a good thing if there's water on the moon ","okay oh okay um oh well this is interesting okay the moon can serve as a stop as crafts to refill their gas tanks "
12946,210.3,Farrah,,"that's true but how does that relate to water ","i don't i don't know "
12951,110.1,Farrah,,"it doesn't totally relate to water but that is a really cool fact ","i'm having water on the moon, would mean more room on the spacecraft for people and things. "
12956,210.3,Farrah,,"exactly so what does that mean how is that valuable ","well it could bring more astronauts they don't have to put the water on the ship "
12958,230.3,Oliver,,"that is student and we know that water is heavy so if there's less space for water than we can bring more people that's awesome a student ","um well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
12960,230.2,Oliver,,"did you read that in the article ","i read it online and well if there's water on the moon it sounds really believable but there could be a base there in three years "
12966,210.3,Jazmin,,"So, knowing that we could have more people on the spacecraft knowing that water is really heavy and knowing that water um and knowing that it's already there, so people could drink it do you guys think that it's valuable that there could be water there. ","yes i think it's valuable because you can't survive without water and that's very valuable "
12969,110.1,Luis,,"yep 100 true student ","um yeah i i also think it's valuable because if you split the water like i said i'm astronauts can i can breathe the oxygen "
12971,110.1,Chris,,"awesome student ","you yeah yeah it's valuable i think having more money the spacecraft's definitely valuable "
12974,110.1,Oliver,,"perfect so now that we've taken the oh yes ","um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for giving every one of us the space to share our responses and opinions it really felt like you cared what we had to say and some teachers don't make us feel like that so thank you so much "
12978,150.1,Luis,,"hi class so i liked hearing your responses about the water on the moon text but i brought us all together just because some of us ","i'm sorry to interrupt excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
12980,150.1,Luis,,"well we're all here together because we're going to deepen our deepen our understanding of what we thought of the text so i think that we all have a reason to be here together so just listen to what i have to say please ","all right okay "
12982,210.4,Farrah,,"what were we really closely looking at ","water "
12987,410.2,Oliver,,"i really wanted to hear your personal thinking and what you thought the answer to the question was not what student thought ","yeah cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that i did have i circled the last sentence which says arm you need a scientific poll on a microscope to look really closely "
12989,120.2,Oliver,,"yeah so i just wanted what do you know what the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon was ","i think it's the microscope but i guess since we're in this class it's not the microscope but i thought it was the microscope "
12991,210.4,Oliver,,"the microscope helps you see something really tiny we learned that they discovered that there was water on the moon but it was so small that they had to use a microscope to see it ","okay "
12993,150.1,Oliver,,"do you understand ","by water we're so small they have to use a microscope to see it "
12996,210.4,Chris,,"do you remember what the scientists used to find the craters ","what do they use to find the craters "
12998,210.4,Chris,,,"no i don't know i mean i know a lot about space but i don't know that "
13000,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class in the class remember reading about what they use to find the craters ","well i put in my answer that nasa sent a small machine i don't know why my answer is wrong "
13003,130.3,Jazmin,,"all right so yeah you're right they did send a small machine but just so class knows the small machine that nasa son was the lunar orbiter ","oh yeah i read that part too "
13007,310.1,Luis,,"I knew you were using your background knowledge because in the reading, we read, we didn't read anything about oxygen tanks, but you knew that when you're on the Loon. You need to have oxygen to be able to breathe, right? ","yeah yeah "
13009,210.4,Luis,,"so can you think of any of the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon ","i'm on the thing that i'm like student said or maybe that you said are student your set i don't know um i think that that's probably the equipment the thing that they said "
13011,130.2,Jazmin,,"do you want to add student what was the equipment that you had said that may be luis's thinking about ","it was lunar orbiter "
13013,130.2,Oliver,,,"i yeah yeah so that was it "
13015,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah and do you remember what the lunar orbiter did ","um it's a center "
13017,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah ","so it flies flies through space "
13021,120.4,Jazmin,,"student maybe ","and oh gosh i don't even remember what the question was now "
13024,120.2,Jazmin,,"we're just trying to help student remember what the lunar orbiter was ","okay student it says nasa send the small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so it was a small machine that investigates "
13026,210.4,Farrah,,"and what did it and what was it looking for class remember that one ","oh ice deposit it's it's looking for ice deposit "
13031,150.1,Chris,,"you understand ","okay yeah yeah yeah i got it oh i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoots um lots and lots of different equipment "
13033,230.3,Chris,,"yeah you need a lot of different equipment to be able to go into outer space don't you ","yeah yeah "
13035,120.2,Chris,,"yeah so you know what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon oh yeah student ","hey i'm sorry no i will wait go ahead "
13037,120.2,Chris,,,"yeah "
13041,150.1,Oliver,,"alright so does class have any confusion about what equipment the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","i don't have i don't have confusion but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch um i know this was short and we just met but i really appreciate how you help us look for evidence from the text in our answers "
13045,150.1,Luis,,"so we're talking about how we just read the moon is a desert and i know that yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13049,110.1,Oliver,,"so so so student i noticed that you said that you circled the same as student ","yeah so she went first i figure i don't have to say the exact same thing as her because i found that same answer "
13051,230.1,Oliver,,"And she went first and you're telling me that that's why you circled it but can you tell me why you what equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon. ","yeah sure i have the same answer as her because i i think it's the microscope "
13054,230.3,Oliver,,"you think it's the microscope ","yeah yeah i do "
13057,150.1,Oliver,,"you understand why it's a microscope ","uh huh because looks like the teacher went offline so we'll wait a moment "
13059,150.1,Oliver,,,"yeah sure so i was saying that i do think the microscope is right because it says i'm a water they found us microscopic blah blah blah blah you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13062,430.3,Jazmin,,"but i do think that there's one thing that's just a little bit more important because it's the machine that was used to discover the water on the moon if you want to look in paragraph two and maybe scan it and tell me if you see anything that talks about the machine used ","teacher i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13065,110.1,Oliver,,"i'll get right to you in just a minute ","okay i see your machine called the lunar orbiter they don't say anything about that one off finding water "
13071,210.4,Oliver,,"so what it's really having us do here student is it's having us infer that they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon ","okay so i read a thing right and i'm i see where it says that it was looking for ice deposits i hold in total 32 ounces of water i mean they say but it could hold water but they don't actually talk about water in the first part "
13075,210.2,Jazmin,,"so i'm just trying to get the answer of what equipment is used to discover the water itself ","thats why i think mine is right teacher because i mean they did use that one and i think it that it was the ice is water so when they were looking for ice deposit they were looking for water "
13079,230.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so student and i remember your answer was that nasa sent a small machine so i can i i wanna i wanna i noticed that you ","Oh, oh yeah the name is a lunar orbiter. "
13084,230.1,Luis,,"can i just ask you what made you say that ","i know a lot about space astronauts can't breathe up there so boom oxygen tanks "
13086,410.1,Luis,,"which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, and do you think that scientists use oxygen tanks to discover water on the moon. ","oh um yeah no i guess they don't use that to discover water "
13089,120.1,Luis,,"so what do you think that the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","Oh okay yeah I see Jazmin why you said you didn't know why yours was wrong place yeah cause ice deposits is water. "
13094,150.1,Luis,,"and that's why me and student just spoke a little bit longer just to make sure student understood what the name of the machine was i'm just trying to so student do you understand what the name of the machine was and what it did ","yeah the lunar orbiter yeah perfect and i looked for ice deposits "
13099,230.1,Chris,,"so i want to i'm i just want to wonder what made you say that ","was looking for the keywords like how you said to student you know from the question because it talked about the question was asking about water on the moon so then in that first paragraph i saw that it was also talking about water on the moon "
13102,410.1,Chris,,"But i'm just concerned that you are understanding the full question itself, because the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon, so my suggestion sorry. ","i was just gonna say that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13107,510.1,Chris,,"you told me before that what you did was you read you noticed that the word water was in the question so you scanned through and you looked for things that related with water ","Okay, so different a different key word from the question. "
13109,510.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later okay "
13112,510.1,Jazmin,,,"okay bye bye "
13119,120.4,Chris,,"what was your answer can you tell me again ","here that on the phone craters full of water on the moon "
13122,210.4,Luis,,"did they use any equipment ","Excuse me. "
13124,210.4,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be on this class i already know all about space "
13127,210.4,Luis,,"did you see anything in the first quote that says anything about equipment ","um okay let me look again "
13131,210.3,Chris,,"student have you found anything ","no not in that paragraph i don't see anything about equipment Yeah yeah "
13136,210.4,Farrah,,"so student can you point out any equipment used ","okay i'm saying small machine machine is like equipment lunar orbiter is to pass it on surface i'm just just a small machine "
13140,210.4,Jazmin,,"what did they call the small machine ","oh yeah they called it the lunar orbiter that's great thank you Excuse me. "
13142,210.4,Jazmin,,,"that's what i have my i answer i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
13145,120.4,Jazmin,,"um can you repeat your answer for me ","yeah i said that nasa found a small machine and that's the same thing student just said and you said it was good "
13150,210.4,Jazmin,,"so the text explains the lunar orbiter does something can you tell me what it does and how it helps scientists ","lunar orbiter land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits it in a large polar crater "
13152,110.4,Jazmin,,"yeah that's what i was looking for your perfect ","oh ok "
13156,120.3,Oliver,,"microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need to scientific tool called the microsoft look very close ","know you'll be used the um the microscope cause that was my answer was a microscope yeah "
13158,210.4,Oliver,,"can you explain to me how the scientists use it to look for water maybe ","i'm yeah i'm okay and i said you may use a microscope to look really closely at the water yeah "
13166,210.4,Luis,,"did they mention anything more about equipment ","mmm hmm okay i was kind of spacing out for a second there um what you say def i said but they use a microscope to look really closely at the water well i mean you do use a microscope to look at things but i don't know why they would bring a microscope all the way up into space i mean they usually use a microscope when they get back down or on their space shuttle or something i think i don't know i don't know about that one Right. Oh, I'm, I'm all okay I don't know. "
13169,210.4,Chris,,,"i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13173,140.1,Luis,,"so student has as well yeah yeah ","well i didn't go to nasa but i did um i've seen that in box yeah "
13176,210.1,Chris,,"did you see the lunar orbiter or microsoft that was referenced you can answer that student as well ","and we didn't see the lunar orbiter but we did see something also be sent up to the moon i don't remember exactly the name of it um oh yeah i don't remember the name of it but it was something small that they sent up to the moon before "
13178,210.1,Chris,,"yeah it's probably a s machine just like a little lunar orbiter ","i'm not clear on so which one is the right answer is usable microscope "
13185,150.1,All,,"does that make sense ","yeah "
13189,150.1,Oliver,,,"well i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you for asking us some good questions that made us have to look back at the story to see if we can actually back up what we're saying like i saw that student couldn't find equipment and then i think for student to what what they were saying so that was that was really helpful thank you "
13192,150.1,Luis,,,"excuse me hi um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13194,150.1,Luis,,"um well actually you might know a lot about space but we're gonna go over what you class read in the text so it might be something that new that you might not know ","okay "
13197,150.1,Luis,,"so have you class already read the text ","um yeah and i want you answered our questions so i'm not even sure why why we're in this class "
13206,420.2,Farrah,,"so do you class see anything that could support your answers from the text ","yeah in in in paragraph three is where i got my answer and i think it's supportive in in paragraph three "
13212,230.2,Jazmin,,"where specifically in paragraph three do you see that ","at the at the end of the paragraph um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely yeah um but i i don't understand why my answer is wrong i'm student i think the answer is the small machine like that's the right answer i'm not sure why mine a while i am in this class but i know that the correct answer is the arm the small machine or the lunar orbiter the small machine called the lunar orbiter is the correct answer "
13215,230.1,Jazmin,,"and student why do you think that is the correct answer to the question ","um cuz well we we got the answer sheet and so i know our answers didn't all get 100 on them and so that's why we got pulled into this class and so the teacher told us that was the answer so that's how come i know "
13217,230.1,Farrah,,,"fine if that's the right answer but still so how come my answer is not the right answer "
13220,110.2,Jazmin,,"actually i think i agree with savannas answer ","the question asked what equipment that they used to discover water on the moon and that's why i said i'm the small machine i that's why i picked the one from paragraph to because it says i'm that is going to investigate and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater and to look for ice deposits that that means like to discover them to find them for the first time "
13222,110.1,Jazmin,,"nice job student ","thanks "
13224,110.4,Jazmin,,"i think you've convinced me ","that i guess i still don't know how come i'm in the class kiss my answer was right i got it from the right place "
13226,130.2,Oliver,,"well i think you're thinking could benefit class else and how you just does class does class else want to explain why their answer could maybe be right ","well i mean in paragraph one it does say that there's the the the waters deep in the craters so i don't think i'm wrong either "
13229,210.2,Chris,,"so craters full of water tells us what they found but we're asking what equipment was used so what tools do they use to find those craters ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks in suits "
13232,130.2,Oliver,,"does class want to help student oh ","well i mean i i support what's the microscope cause my there's a tool as equipment and they're talking about looking at water and in that part of a story "
13238,210.2,Jazmin,,"The to look at the water. What did they use to find the water ","paragraph to paragraph two, oh "
13246,130.2,Oliver,,"student what do you think ","okay well i guess i gotta look in paragraph two ice depository small on top of the top layers i was just like for glasses blah blah blah on your original land look for deposits okay i mean i guess i see at an end that where they say they're going to look for deposits yeah i mean i think i think i think um but it isn't paragraph two because they say that the lunar orbiter is gonna look for the ice deposits so yeah i think jazmin's right okay okay um okay well it's it's time for us to go to lunch um anyway i know this was really short and we just met but i do really appreciate you having us to keep looking back i felt taxed and to think about the words and the question too i think about that helped me think about my answer something like i gosh i don't know "
13248,130.2,All,,,"okay bye "
13250,130.2,Luis,,,"good morning "
13254,150.1,Luis,,"that we recently did over water on the moon yes student ","excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13266,120.4,Jazmin,,"so does class want to explain their answer to the question initially ","oh i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
13274,210.4,Farrah,,"let's go back to the text and see if that's true can class find in the text where it talks about what tools they use to find the water ","well i mean in my answer i i said a tool uh the microscope because i use that to look at the water "
13280,210.2,Chris,,"however the question is asking how did they find the water so they use it to look at the water but what did they use to find the water ","okay so i saw the part where i found it in the story where i i saw it at the beginning of paragraph two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so that was the equipment that i thought oh yeah i could see that because student said microscope for equipment and student said on the lunar orbiter for equipment "
13282,310.1,Chris,,"And thank you Jazmin for explaining your answer and using the text really well. ","and i went to nasa so i know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13290,310.1,Luis,,"answer because it really, like I said, it really uses the text like Farrah's. ","I noticed that too. And that's why I oh I looked for the part that had the most stuff about the water yeah i didn't see that much "
13303,210.4,Jazmin,,"so if that's where the water was what did they use to find the ice deposits can class tell me can class refer to the text ","um i don't think it's mine it's in paragraph two um it's ok i'm gonna look because i did see it oh yeah yeah you're right student it is um these eyes deposits are very small oh just like you said teacher oh scientists said that one of the yeah so so this paragraph's about the lunar orbiter yeah like i said so it's they use they use the lunar orbiter to find the ice deposits "
13307,210.4,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i know this was really short and we just met but it's time for us to go to lunch well i really appreciate how you made class feel so valued with their answers and how like you know i heard you tell student and student that they did a good job finding evidence from the text and then i remember now that i i picked the microscope because i was thinking about how it was looking at the water but you said to discover means to find the water and so you helped me think about what some of the meanings of the words discovered mean too so oh thanks so much it was really nice having you "
13311,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13314,150.1,Luis,,"that's interesting thing to say i don't think even science all like scientists that have studied space for years know everything about space ","i mean ask me anything i know i know everything that i need to know "
13325,220.1,Farrah,,"and how we work to break down questions and such um ","i couldn't remember it but i have it on my tablet i have mine on my tablet too "
13330,120.4,Farrah,,"awesome okay um so looking at the responses um does class and just raise your hand but does class would class like to share their response with us ","okay yeah i can share mine oh i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13332,110.1,Farrah,,"okay awesome ","i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13340,310.1,Farrah,,"it talks about specific things that the question asks ","thank you "
13346,120.3,Jazmin,,"um would class like to read the question the first question for us ","i can read the question okay the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon "
13349,210.2,Oliver,,"so breaking down the question does class know what the word equipment means ","yeah it's like something that you use to do something like in pe class coach always says okay go get the equipment and then we get like the balls and thing "
13356,210.4,Farrah,,"can class find in the text where it mentions discovering where it mentions discovering water or discovering something on the moon ","i thought that that's why i thought my answer was right because in paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic so that means that they found the water and and then they talk about the microscope in the next sentence "
13369,210.4,Chris,,"Something on the moon. ","yeah sure and you know i also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits It's in the first in the first paragraph "
13374,110.1,Jazmin,,"alright thank you so much ","And my answer came from the second paragraph. so i guess it's all over the story "
13378,130.1,Oliver,,"yeah we're just getting closer and closer to the answer ","i was just looking at that time so i'm sorry it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay "
13384,130.1,Chris,,,"i was just saying hi "
13386,130.1,Luis,,,"well i was gonna speak excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13389,150.1,Luis,,"i don't think even scientists like scientists that have been studying space their whole lives know all about space space is so big ","i mean well i know a lot about space "
13394,220.1,Farrah,,"information that we might not even know about yet so how do we do that and stuff ","yeah we have it on our tablet "
13399,210.2,Jazmin,,"so does class know what the word equipment means ","yeah "
13403,210.2,Oliver,,,"um ok equipment is ike what you use to do things so like in pe class coach always tells us go get the appointment and then we get like the balls and stuff "
13408,210.2,Jazmin,,"equipment that astronauts use or maybe not in the text, but just in general astronauts use helmets. Yes, Jazmin? ","ok i i used equipment in my answer so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13413,220.1,Farrah,,"so we just want to make sure that class is using the right language and class understands how to find the find the evidence for their answer and such um student you had your hand up well i was ","well i was kinda gonna say the same thing as student because i used equipment and my answer too "
13422,150.1,Chris,,"um however i think that some some mistakes that i saw across the board in some answers or maybe not some mistakes but just some places that class can work on um i believe ","I can. "
13425,150.1,Chris,,,"it asks what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so it wants us to enter what what did the equipment well i don't know how to say it in another way yeah what equipment do they use to find water on the moon i guess is another way "
13429,210.2,Chris,,"Instruments did they use ","oh that's good yeah yeah you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13437,420.2,Chris,,"um so would class maybe like to revise their answer and maybe just include a piece of evidence in there or a specific word ","well i know mine has some evidence from the text yeah mine too i pulled mine right from the story too "
13441,110.2,Jazmin,,"yeah that is very true you both do use very specific evidence um ","no i don't mind "
13449,210.4,Oliver,,"look back at the text what is the name of the small machine ","it's the lunar orbiter oh sorry i'll raise my hand it's the lunar orbiter "
13454,420.2,Jazmin,,"so now that we now that we know that that that the expectation is maybe using more specific language student would you maybe like to revise your answer using one of the words that we just discussed or one of the phrases that we just discussed ","ok um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter "
13458,310.1,Oliver,,"is really, really nice way to phrase that. ","good excuse me teacher i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining more that some of us needed to do a little bit more specifics from that text because i guess i didn't do that too like jamine so now i know "
13466,110.1,Luis,,"so student you said that we would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look super closely ","excuse me teacher "
13468,110.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
13473,110.3,Luis,,"i know you know all about space i'm i'm sure you all know a lot about space ","yeah yeah "
13486,210.4,Jazmin,,"paragraph three says that the water they found is microscopic or if you were looking straight at it you wouldn't be able to see it ","i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
13490,420.2,Jazmin,,"like orbiter things like that so we want to make sure you're using the most strong vocabulary you can from the reading does that make sense ","i have to add more vocabulary "
13495,410.2,Jazmin,,"i just need to like we need to be able to understand what small machine it was because it tells you what small machine it is in the reading right ","see oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter so it's called a lunar orbiter "
13499,110.4,Jazmin,,"so that's awesome ","oh that's it "
13504,120.4,Oliver,,"So with that in mind, who can tell me what are the two tools that we need ","that my answer i said that um the microscope already um ah but like just like sabrina did um and i guess the one that student said too "
13506,120.4,Chris,,"which is what like ","i went to nasa "
13510,120.4,Chris,,,"yeah so i know that scientists yeah me and my dad we went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so they use a lot of different equipment "
13522,210.3,Chris,,"the reading i know you can tell me what small machine they send and i know you can tell me what what they used to see it student ","yeah uh huh "
13526,120.2,Chris,,"So I'm going to read the question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon. ","ok ok "
13530,430.1,Oliver,,"so you didn't quite answer the question there you did say a fair point but the question really was what type of equipment did they use to see the water what type of machines did they use so if you take a look back in paragraph two and three to tell you what they use ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was a really short time um i appreciate how you encouraged me to use my own words and then i heard you tell some of the other class that they should make sure that they read the whole question "
13535,150.1,Luis,,"so i've just been reading your responses and i wanted to pull you class into a smaller class because i feel like we can all do a little bit of improving on our responses and that's okay yes student excuse me ","i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13539,150.1,Luis,,"oh i know you do we all definitely know all about space and i know you all wrote some well all a lot of great answers but we just want to take the time to make sure that your sentences are ","yeah yeah let's start with me "
13544,210.3,Luis,,"okay so you you did the reading and you found that they found oxygen or that they needed oxygen tanks to dig up so now my question is did you see any other types of equipment besides the oxygen tank ","i don't remember "
13556,210.3,Jazmin,,"a small machine a small machine what else do you remember ","oh i just underlined it that's the lunar orbiter machine oh that's "
13559,210.3,Farrah,,"that's perfect do you know any other tools ","teacher well jazmin's looking i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13568,420.3,Jazmin,,"that would be a good start so again my suggestion is to think about the question in your head and then go back in the reading and try and underline all of the types of equipment that you can find in the reading ","yeah i'm ready "
13570,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i was saying i wrote this intense now i found a more equipment name "
13578,210.4,Oliver,,"what do scientists use on the moon to discover water ","yeah the microscope "
13582,210.3,Oliver,,"perfect anything else ","was that was the one you were looking at the lunar orbiter "
13586,120.4,Chris,,"student do you want to share your sentence with me really quick oh student yes student well ","i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13590,230.1,Chris,,"can i ask you why if you knew that you didn't write that in your answer ","that wasn't what they were asking i was trying to answer the question "
13592,210.2,Chris,,"well i think that the question was asking if you knew that nasa used oxygen tanks and microscopes that's what the question is asking not would you say that's good equipment ","i would say that's equipment because we were talking about equipment but then it's saying specifically to discover water on the moon and so that you don't use their suits to discover the water they use their suits to stay warm "
13595,110.1,Oliver,,"you're right ","upside interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock it's time for us to go "
13603,150.1,Luis,,"and they all had great information in them i just pulled you aside because i think we can each dave a little deeper okay yes student excuse me ","i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13605,150.1,Luis,,"i know you class all know all about space but i just want to make sure that you're capturing the reading and the question clearly ok ","ok "
13614,150.1,Chris,,"raise your hands when you're all done reading okay ","well i need a two on underline just equipment right "
13620,130.1,Farrah,,"all right student you talked about how you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's a great sentence great start ","yeah i saw in paragraph two there was a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
13623,420.2,Jazmin,,"perfect now can you add that to your whole sentence and make a whole new sentence for me ","yeah let me try teacher i said the small machine couple lunar orbiter so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13627,150.1,Farrah,,"i just want to make sure that you class are getting it and i want to make sure that you have a little more understanding so student are you ready to take your time ","i got an answer to "
13629,120.4,Farrah,,"oh perfect what's your answer okay ","um scientists used a tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate "
13632,420.2,Jazmin,,"you said that nasa sent a small machine that's perfect nasa did send a small machine but i want you to add more i want you to build on that now you went back and you highlighted the lunar orbiter as one did you highlight a second one ","i highlighted the microscope to "
13634,420.2,Jazmin,,"perfect can you rebuild your sentence for me in a way that explains both of them ","i need i need a minute "
13638,110.2,Chris,,"Chris your response was great you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon that's correct ","yeah i did the same ones that student did i highlighted the lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope "
13642,210.4,Chris,,"are there any other scientific tools the scientists used ","well there's spacecraft i think spacecraft as equipment "
13647,120.1,Chris,,"that's perfect i mean now you have three different types of equipment so why don't you go through and rewrite your sentence take a minute to rewrite it and then come back and i'll ask you for your sentence okay okay ","teacher i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
13649,120.1,Oliver,,,"i'm ready "
13660,120.4,Oliver,,"what did you have ","the same ones i guess class else because also the only two that i saw full lunar orbiter and paragraph to another microscope i already had circled on my on my tablet awesome let's see. what's the question what equipment that scientists use their equipment that scientists use was a lunar orbiter and the microscope "
13662,110.1,Oliver,,"student that's awesome that's perfect that's a great sentence and you got great answers ","teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for for helping us i'm really look for more details in the story because i thought i did find everything but that one you said to read and highlight i found more "
13665,110.1,Oliver,,,"see you "
13670,110.1,Luis,,,"i'm good i'm ok i'm good too excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13672,110.3,Luis,,"well that's awesome now you can help the rest of your friends learn about space too so i think you should stay with us ","okay "
13679,120.4,Farrah,,"does class know the answer to that question ","i got my answer that they use the microscope my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13681,110.1,Jazmin,,"that's awesome that is a perfect response good job student ","i got a different answer "
13684,110.1,Jazmin,,,"i thought it was i thought it was a lunar orbiter i wrote down you know nasa sent a small machine "
13692,150.1,Jazmin,,"do you see what i'm saying ","okay let me look again so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so investigate um so i was thinking about you know like when you watch the investigator shows where they're looking for clues so then i was like well investigate is when you're looking for something and i didn't choose the microscope because they were looking at the water not looking for the water so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
13696,210.4,Jazmin,,"so if we look back in the second paragraph the small machine is called a lunar orbiter to investigate that's looking to find the water but as we see it in the third paragraph it says that the water they found is microscopic so the water that is found you need to look at it with a small machine called a microscope because you can only see it with the microscope not the lunar orbiter ","oh okay "
13699,120.4,Chris,,"does class else want to share their answers ","well yeah i had a completely different answer than them i said let me look at what i wrote down yeah scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
13707,410.2,Chris,,"but you didn't take that extra step to look for the small machine's name ","um so it is correct that they found craters full of water on the moon but i didn't see the name of the machine "
13711,110.1,Luis,,"that's exactly ","okay okay yeah i can get that okay fine but me i mean i know my answer is right too because i talked about equipment and i know that it's appointment that scientists use because you know i read about space all the time "
13713,120.4,Luis,,"okay let me hear it ","oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
13718,410.1,Chris,,"alright student so when we look back at the question it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon while it may be true that scientists do use oxygen tanks and probably very often it's not the equipment that they use to find water on the moon ","okay they do use oxygen tanks but they didn't use them to find the water okay okay okay i guess yeah i could go for that you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits "
13726,150.1,Jazmin,,"do you class see that ","okay yeah yeah yeah yeah i could okay okay well so then what would be my how would i tried to change my answer to to make it like a complete answer "
13729,230.3,Jazmin,,"so your answer was nasa sent a small machine ","uh huh "
13733,420.2,Oliver,,"That's all you need to do, because you did say it was a small machine and you just needed to put the name of it. So NASA sent a small machine called a microscope and then your answer would be perfect. ","okay i just have to put the name of it on there oh i crossed it out i guess they didn't need to cross it out oh okay wow okay oh man um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for keeping us to like look back at the question i kept hearing you say oh but student that's a good answer but it's not in the question that's true student but that's not in the question so i guess we have to we have to like read the question a little bit more closely next time "
13739,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say that i know all of this stuff so i don't think i need to be on this class i don't need any help "
13741,110.3,Luis,,"okay i'm glad that you know so much about this already but i think you should stay so you can help me with this assignment with your classmates does that sound okay ","yeah yeah okay i can do that "
13745,120.4,Farrah,,"perfect who wants to share their answer first ","okay yeah so my answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
13751,230.1,Farrah,,"can you tell me why you chose the microscope as the answer ","yeah so my thinking was that Okay, so if you're trying to play, you have to first be able to see it. how do you find if you can't see right so when i was looking at the different types of reading i thought microscope was the best answer because you couldn't discover something unless you could see right and and we know we know that the water was microscope "
13755,210.3,Farrah,,"The question asks what small machine to do to discover the water, so if the if they're using a microscope to find the water they're already on and you look back at the reading what small machine, do you think found the water? ","that's a really good question i'm not totally sure because well i can look and see because i'm not really sure is it still seems like the microscope would be the first thing i guess i could second look at "
13759,110.2,Farrah,,"and in the question asked what machine discovered the water so your answer is correct ","is the answer to the lunar orbiter "
13762,110.1,Oliver,,"yes it is excellent ","um i also got that answer from from what said and i said that it's the lunar orbiter "
13764,230.1,Oliver,,"did you work with savannh on this question ","um i did the first time and then i heard her say lunar orbiter and now i know it's the lunar orbiter "
13767,410.2,Oliver,,"i love how you worked together with her and i think it's great to work with your classmates in class but for your answer i want to hear what you have to say ","okay um well i think it is the lunar orbiter cuz what you were saying was that we needed to look for you know what i mean like something that actually discovered the water was in the question and like found it and then you said they they they looked in the microscope after they found it so then it has to be the lunar orbiter that out "
13771,110.1,Jazmin,,"that's excellent student so glad that you're listening and paying attention in class ","i think i am just a little confused i was confused because i also thought it was the lunar orbiter like why my answer was wrong "
13774,120.4,Jazmin,,"what was your answer let me hear it one more time ","yeah yeah my answer which really was nasa send a small machine "
13778,230.1,Jazmin,,"can you tell me why you picked that as your answer i'm not saying it's wrong but i want to hear where you're coming from with that ","yes so i was thinking that when i was reading like it was saying basically that like okay where does it say i can read it it says nasa sentence for me she called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i thought that was the answer the question was saying like what equipment that the scientists used to discover the water and so that makes me think what had to be the lunar orbiter right so i i was saying that it was the small machine that they you know they sent this fall machine it that was the the answer "
13783,420.2,Jazmin,,"my only suggestion for you like your answer was almost perfect is just to put the name of the small machine that's it that's my only issue otherwise your answer is perfect ","okay that makes perfect sense so like to make a complete answer it has to include the name of the thing yes awesome thank you "
13788,420.2,Chris,,,"um so okay so i was just you know i was a little bit confused because i was thinking like well okay i was thinking that i went to nasa so when i was there with my dad i aw that like they had stuff like oxygen tanks and masks and i was thinking like they have to have use those to discover the water so i guess i'm confused by that tonight and "
13793,130.3,Chris,,"they use the lunar orbiter to discover the water and they do use the other equipment but the lunar orbiter purpose is to discover the water ","oh so it's like a like maybe they weren't astronauts up there like maybe it was a like a nasa they call it an unmanned pro and that's like you know maybe that was it "
13796,110.4,Oliver,,"it definitely could have been just up there lunar orbiter ","i'm so i unfortunately we have to go to our next class but before we go i really just wanted to thank you um this was a really interesting conversation so thank you so much for working with us bye "
13800,110.4,Luis,,,"so i just wanted to say that i kind of know like all about space already so i don't think i need any help i don't need to be in this "
13802,110.3,Luis,,"well i'm so glad that you already know so much about space but do you think you could stay and help me answer the questions for your other classmates too ","yeah i get i can stick around for that yeah for sure "
13806,120.4,Oliver,,"so who wants to share their answer first ","awesome "
13809,230.1,Oliver,,"did you work with student on the question ","oh yeah we work together a lot of help each other out "
13817,420.2,Farrah,,"well i'm so glad that you worked with your classmates and i think it's really important to work with your classmates but when answering your question on your own paper i really would love if you could explain your answer rather than say you didn't listen to someone else ","oh yeah i can do that so basically what we said was we thought that you would need a scientific tool called the microscope we thought that was the equipment that the scientists used to discover the water we agreed that it was the microphone right student yeah Farrah, do you want to tell me why you guys pick the microscope? um yeah so basically we we picked microscope because i think he was that the waters microscope no not a telescope you need like a microscope to see microscopic water it says you can't see it unless you have a microscope or like i guess yeah so you need to be able to see it and basically if you can't see the order like how are the astronauts like finding like when you know what i mean like how are they supposed to discover the water if they can't even see it "
13823,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","um i guess but actually it's kind of music because like i still think like that question like yeah they could see the water and they could study the water but how could they do that if they couldn't find it "
13832,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","yeah i can see make sense i guess yeah that makes sense we need to look kind of but i think that we okay so we were looking at the keywords right there yeah we were looking at the keywords and we were trying to find like okay so we were looking for equipment and we found other equipment in the reading but we still thought the microscope was was the answer because we thought it had to be the first equipment that they use other than like a spaceship "
13836,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","yeah okay so if it was used for the stuff that was discovered how did they discover "
13839,130.3,Jazmin,,"that's perfect that's the perfect question that is what we're trying to find the answer to and if you class look back you'll see that it says the lunar lunar orbiter discovered the water ","so i just had a question i was just like why my answer was wrong "
13842,120.4,Jazmin,,"can you read me your answer one more time please ","yeah what i said was that yes it's it is "
13845,420.2,Jazmin,,"And the only only recommendation I have, for your answer, because it's almost there is to just name the small machine that they used. That's it to make your answer perfect. ","oh oh so like that so they so this is the leader or better to discover or rather the scientists discovered water on the moon using the lunar orbiter right "
13847,110.1,Jazmin,,"that is perfect ","yes "
13849,110.1,Chris,,,"okay so i was just the key because my dad and i went to nasa and i i know that they use like equipment like oxygen masks suits and stuff like that so i was just wondering like should that be in the reading "
13853,410.1,Chris,,"so you're definitely right about how nasa uses so much equipment to do so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific machine or equipment that they used to find the water ","like okay i think that makes sense oh okay oh okay does that make sense like okay i think that makes sense "
13857,150.1,Luis,,"does class else have any questions or confused about anything ","um so was my answer right "
13859,120.4,Luis,,"can you read me your answer please ","yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equip like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
13863,410.1,Luis,,"that is true and it's basically just what i told student that the scientists do use a lot of equipment so much equipment for so many different things but the question is only asking for one specific piece of equipment that was used to find the water ","yeah but didn't they use like oxygen takes to walk around and see the water "
13866,130.3,Luis,,"so if you wanted to write as your answer that they use the lunar orbiter and they use so many other machines for different things you could and that would be right but i think just saying the lunar orbiter is perfectly fine too ","interesting "
13871,130.3,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a moment and i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular it was really interesting and helpful how you asked us about kind of like like how we got to the answer you know because it was helping us to understand ourselves how we got to the answer and then you helped us by like you really made us feel value because every answer that we had like even if it was like kind of wrong on you made sure that we knew that it was you know a still a valuable answer so thank you so much "
13876,120.4,Luis,,"so student i'm going to call on you first so what did you say when you answer this question ","excuse me teacher i shouldn't be ms great i already know all about space "
13883,130.1,Luis,,"Answer the question because often chicks are definitely use. ","Hmm, OK. OK, I'll "
13887,120.1,Farrah,,"okay i'll call on you in a second ","the water "
13891,210.3,Luis,,"Luis Do you have anything. Have you thought of an answer. Yeah. ","um well i see a couple of pieces of equipment and the text you you you're right there isn't anything about the oxygen but they have talked about a lunar orbiter and i talked about the the microscope like what student said "
13893,210.4,Luis,,"so what did the lunar orbiter do to help find water on the moon ","um well it says that it landed on the moon um let me see what that means about finding water i'm not sure "
13898,130.2,Jazmin,,"So, Jazmin, what do you think ","well still don't understand why my answers wrong "
13905,430.2,Jazmin,,"to the moon so that's correct but i wanted to know maybe what was the small machine and how did it help find water on the moon so do you think you can look back in the text and maybe figure out that will give me a little bit more information ","okay so i should look for what the machine did "
13907,420.2,Jazmin,,"and maybe add what the machine was called ","okay "
13912,110.2,Chris,,"all right student how are we doing so your response was scientists found craters full of water on the moon which is completely true ","an instrument okay i guess it probably be something that you can say "
13919,150.1,Chris,,"or you could use maybe something you found on your own you don't need to use what you said ","okay okay i'm gonna read it and see a small machine called investigate look for ice deposits in a large crater i suppose well the only other paragraph that talks about the waters paragraph three so what does it say in paragraph three that they use for an instrument to find water "
13921,210.4,Chris,,"and microscope and what is the microscope ","it's something you use to look at really small thing "
13925,210.4,Chris,,"right so how did they use a microscope to find the water ","well it didn't really say it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely you know i went to nasa so i know that i just use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits right "
13932,110.2,Chris,,"instruments they used to find the water which was microscope so that's really great ","you put it doesn't i don't know i don't know how how they got bad answer from the question because the question says what equipment did scientists used to discover water on the moon and you need a scientific to column microscope so it's the same answer is student ducks into that "
13937,230.3,Chris,,"Be used to find a water and she said to me that microscopes looked really closely and then they found the water because some more. ","I think so. Cuz she explained more of it. That's what made her that that's what made it a better answer. "
13939,420.2,Chris,,"yes so she took the instrument she explained with instrument did and then explained how the instrument helps find the water ","okay yeah i think so "
13942,230.2,Oliver,,"so def you said you had the same answer as student do you want to explain a little bit what you found when you're reading ","yeah cause i read the question i'm like here are some words you're saying is that one equipment the scientists use to find to discover water on the moon so i was like a microscope isn't equipment and this paragraph is talking about water so so that's why i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
13947,510.1,Oliver,,"great so i really liked that response because you explained yourself really well you said that you read the question you saw what the question was asking for and then you found it and explained why so that was a really great response ","oh thanks okay good job "
13949,210.3,Luis,,"student did you figure out any answers after giving yourself a little bit more time ","okay so i i read the whole thing again and i think the answer is about the lunar orbiter because i know that um i think student said that it doesn't talk about water but it talks about ice and ice just frozen water and so that's why i think that's "
13958,110.4,Oliver,,"so yes that is one of the answers to that the equipment was used to find water on the moon so great job ","thanks thanks a lot hey i'm on excuse me teacher i just looked at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to her site thanks for helping us know that we needed to use more evidence because i heard your toll student and student that they had to pull from the story and all that for the rest of us that we should try to find more stuff in the story to us in our answer so thanks for that by "
13965,210.2,Chris,,"so i'm going to reread the question and once i finish i want one of you to raise your hand and tell me what the question is asking for and it's answer so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","it's asking for the name of equipment "
13968,110.1,Luis,,"so now let's look at your responses so student you circled the same thing as student and so you said that you needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely now i mean ","i'm sorry teacher excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
13970,130.1,Luis,,"you do well student i bet you have a ton of background knowledge on all of your science equipment but i think that what this question was asking for doesn't mean necessarily background knowledge but more for you to look at the evidence from the text ","oh okay "
13974,420.3,Luis,,"in this text it did not specifically state that a microscope or oxygen tanks were being used so why don't we look back in the text and see if you can see specific equipment that was used to find the water on the moon and circle that answer ","okay "
13979,150.1,Farrah,,"and you can raise your hand if you finally found a piece ","ok so i found a small machine i found the lunar orbiter "
13982,130.3,Jazmin,,"um so a lunar orbiter is a the actual answer to the prompt so that's the equipment that was found in the text that describes what was used to find water yes student ","well i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
13990,310.1,Oliver,,"i love how you got the answer by using evidence from the text ","ok ok okay but they also a microscope is a small machine and it does say that they looked for oh they looked at the water using a microscope so that that should count "
13997,210.2,Chris,,"But the question was asking for what was what equipment was used to find the water not look at it after it was found. ","Ok, ok. as we're talking about equipment i was thinking so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
14005,210.2,Oliver,,"but for this specific question we are looking for what equipment was used to discover water on the moon ","reach every reader ok ok so it looks like it's time for the next class so we'll see you later teacher "
14015,150.1,Luis,,"That supported the question and I do see some more evidence from the text that we use that's really good. ","okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good yeah okay sure, and so it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable. um it wants us to say. if water is valuable or not "
14021,150.1,Farrah,,"and raise your hand if you find any evidence that would right away tell you yes or now ","okay um the um the first like title it says water is a valuable resource "
14024,210.3,Oliver,,"Great job Farrah. so in some of your answers, Farrah and Oliver, I realized you say, you both said no it's not ready yet and so now, after talking about this little bit um do you think your answer has changed at all? ","okay well i mean i see how the that title says that it is a valuable resource but then in the story it says something different all right yeah yeah like okay i have the same answer as student because when i read the like a sixth paragraph it says it says that it's gonna be really expensive "
14029,210.4,Jazmin,,"can you find a maybe a point in the texts that explains a benefit to having water and why it would be valuable ","ok okay well i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
14034,420.2,Jazmin,,"i think you should be looking at the text and pulling evidence for a specific sentence that relates to explaining why water is valuable ","well i'm still kind of confused because i found this this one right in the story so how come it's not evidence "
14037,230.2,Jazmin,,"um let's see can you point out to me where you found that ","okay yeah it's in the the third sentence in paragraph four for example future astronauts could drink this water "
14042,150.1,Jazmin,,"Does that make sense? ","yeah i think so "
14044,210.3,Jazmin,,"ok so if you had to redo your answer student what would you say now ","well would i i think i'd still keep the first sentence right "
14048,210.3,Chris,,"mm hmm and then what would you add to it ","um i guess the sentence after it astronauts could drink the water water is heavy takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft that's what i put in my answer um i did read that they they might have a moon base on the moon by 2024 yeah "
14053,230.3,Chris,,"the text so that's a great response ","so how come i'm here because i used the evidence from the text and including the part that you told student she should put in her answer "
14058,150.1,Chris,,"not carrying the water on the spaceship would be valuable does that make sense ","um saying more about why it would be valuable "
14060,210.3,Chris,,"yes so you said you brought up a good point from the text that water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore but why would that be valuable to people in space in scientists ","cuz then maybe they wouldn't have to burn up as much fuel "
14062,420.2,All,,"so make sure to relate our answer back to the question that's being asked ","bye "
14065,420.2,Oliver,,,"oh we're we're pretty good we're excited to see you "
14067,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah i guess it's more of like a statement like i already know like all this stuff about space so like i don't think i really even need to be in this class "
14069,150.1,Luis,,"right i understand but it's really important like when we listen to other students responses it only helps us better understand what we're learning about and it's also great i'm sure you'll have some great contributions today ","yeah i can do that "
14075,420.2,Farrah,,"so referring to the water on the moon text can you kind of elaborate on that response can you tell me why you need a microscope ","yeah so okay so what i saw when i was looking at it is that it says the water is the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you don't like you have to have the microscope to even see the water do you know what i mean and see the water how do you find the water "
14082,230.1,Chris,,"can you elaborate on that response ","that's interesting because i was thinking about crater so you were saying that the question is like what equipment so well okay so like you know i've been to nasa so like i know that scientists use lots of equipment like on oxygen tanks and mass and shoots and i guess like that's something they use right "
14085,210.2,Chris,,"right but what more specifically did they use to discover water on the moon ","i'm not sure "
14088,130.2,Jazmin,,"that's okay can class help him ","well actually the thing that i was thinking about was i wasn't really sure why my answer was well "
14094,230.2,Jazmin,,"um but i'm just wondering more specifically what small machine did they use how do you know they used to small machin like did it tell you in the text where in the text is that ","yeah yeah it's it in yet basically was like in the in the text it was saying and pick up three that no no no a pair of to this moment she was the lunar orbiter is that is that what i got wrong i didn't say this thing "
14098,230.1,Oliver,,"so student i see that you said that you i mean you were all working in a small class which is great you're using each other to help one another but why did you circle the same thing as student what did you fully understand this question do you need me to to re explain it why did you think it is a right answer ","i had kind of the same thinking and what i was thinking was basically that like the water was microscopic and i was thinking like you can't you know what i mean like i guess i was thinking like how did they find the water and it seems like they found the water using the microscope "
14100,110.2,Jazmin,,"right so that answers the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon that's great nice work ","yeah i can say was just wondering since i was thinking like that it seemed like the lunar orbiter we see that they use to discover the water so is it both the microscope and the lunar orbiter is it just one "
14107,210.4,Oliver,,"so it's actually both of them so in our text in the second bullet point it says that nasa sent this small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate they used both the lunar orbiter and the microscope to explore these things and the lunar orbiter helped look for ice deposits which is another form of water right ice is just frozen water so they use both of these things to explore the water on the moon ","um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for like first of all you really made sure that we kept going back into the text and being like what what does it say in the reading and you were really beginning to help us make sure we were using evidence and in our answers and i think that was really cool and like what seven and i you asked us like why we came to our answer and that was especially cool because it got me thinking about like how i think about stuff and like how i do it so it was really cool when you're asking us like how did we come to our answer so thank you so much for working with us it was a lot of fun bye "
14109,210.4,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14118,120.2,Farrah,,"the question what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon ","yeah i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
14123,230.1,Farrah,,"can you tell me why that's that was what your that was what you said ","oh yeah okay um so cuz i was looking for like you said the arm the words in a question i was looking for equipment and water on the moon and i saw in paragraph three they talk about finding water which is what the question is asking about discovering water and then the lesson into the one that has the name of the equipment "
14127,120.4,Jazmin,,"so now student can you tell me what you answered what your answer was ","yeah i said i said to small machine and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
14131,210.4,Jazmin,,"so if you look back into the text what do you notice about the specific tools it says they used to discover water on the moon ","small machine called i guess that it's called a lunar orbiter "
14136,120.2,Jazmin,,"okay so now moving on to the second question it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon excuse me could be valuable ","um so i guess i still don't know what what my answer should be do i just have to add the lunar orbiter to the answer to make it right "
14144,310.1,Jazmin,,"by looking back in the text you found another thing that they use to discover water on the moon by adding those key terms you're answering the question and that's great ","so so if i say i'm nasa send a small machine quarterly in order to investigate To investigate. well i mean the question says to discover water that's not the same thing as investigating water "
14146,420.3,Jazmin,,"it's not always going to be like super easy the same word in the text, sometimes you're going to have to think what synonyms are in the text, what other things might mean something similar to investigate or discover. ","okay "
14148,420.3,Chris,,,"oh yeah i was thinking about some other specific equipment it's not in a story but i did i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks mask suits "
14156,410.1,Chris,,"to help you understand this question this question specifically is asking what what equipment they use to discover the water yes they do use that equipment to help them discover the water but that is not the actual equipment that is discovering the water ","oh yeah yeah okay i see what you're saying i see what you're saying okay um what for my answer um i guess i'm trying to think what did i miss okay so i've got the scientists on craters for water on the moon scientists found which one is student right or is student right which which equipment one is right "
14162,430.2,Chris,,"so you're saying that they were able to discover water on the moon but you're not necessarily saying what equipment they used so in order to strengthen your response you might want to add something about the equipment that they use much like student and student added ","okay oh so like scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters for water the moon "
14164,430.2,Chris,,,"i was adding lunar orbiter into my answers oh scientists use the lunar orbiter to find craters full of water on the moon "
14168,310.1,Oliver,,"awesome so you started with they found these craters of water and then you you referred back to the question you thought about your peers responses and you ended up adding the equipment that they used ","oh sorry sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and actually it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
14172,310.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14181,120.4,Chris,,"so today student could you tell me what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon could you read your answer to me ","yeah oh scientist phone critters all scientists fall for water "
14185,230.3,Chris,,"right so actually in the text it does say that they found creators of water on the moon so you're you're telling me that you know they did in fact discover water on the moon ","yeah i just heard it when i was reading my answer when you said what equipment was i'm missing equipment "
14191,210.3,Chris,,"so if you build on your answer that you already have what might you add to strengthen your response ","scientists phone creators for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
14195,530.1,Chris,,"so can you tell me how your answer changed from the beginning ","i'm ok ok i didn't have the name of any equipment in my answer and then i added the names of pieces of equipment in mind "
14199,120.4,Farrah,,"alright so now student can you tell me what you answered what you said ","yeah um well i took all the same thing yeah and i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
14201,120.4,Farrah,,,"me "
14204,120.4,Farrah,,"ok ok so student can you tell me what you said ","yeah i said on scientists use know you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
14209,230.1,Oliver,,"and student so student can you tell me why you circled the same thing as student ","um yeah cuz i was looking for all of the keywords in the question like how you said i'm always looking for equipment and discover and water and the moon and that was the only place that had all of the parts in it "
14212,210.4,Farrah,,"if you refer back to the text if you look at paragraph two can you tell me what machine nasa sent to discover the water ","they said the lunar orbiter well how do you know that they sent it to discover the water "
14214,210.4,Farrah,,"it says in the next sentence this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater ","yeah i was looking for the word water i forgot i didn't because they didn't actually say water in this in the paragraph about the lunar orbiter "
14218,210.3,Farrah,,"can you tell me building on the response that you already have what might you add to make it a little bit stronger ","you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and a lunar orbiter to investigate "
14221,150.1,Oliver,,"so student does that make sense to you too ","yeah i think so so we just have to say both of the names of the equipment in our answer "
14223,230.1,Oliver,,"right but why why is it important to include both of those names of the tools ","because they used both of them to find the water "
14227,110.1,Chris,,"exactly ","okay i was just thinking about some other equipment you know that the scientists use because i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks "
14235,210.3,Oliver,,"yeah so that equipment is used for the scientists themselves right and but do they need that equipment to actually discover the water on the moon does the lunar orbiter where that equip excuse me equipment on the moon ","no no it's a machine Right okay yeah I wasn't even thinking about that maybe they didn't have the astronauts on the moon that they just sent the machine by itself, I just I figured the astronauts were there with the machine. yeah yeah that makes sense. when you were talking to student and student like why i would have to add both of the machines there until you kind of asked me until yeah so that was useful for me "
14237,210.3,Oliver,,,"thanks "
14239,210.3,Oliver,,,"hi "
14242,120.2,Luis,,"my name is teacher so you class just answered what object did i'm so sorry what equipment did the scientists used to discover water in the moon right ok ","well i was just going to say i kind of know all about space already so i don't even think i should be in this class "
14244,110.3,Luis,,"oh maybe you can tell us and share what you know it does so we also can know about it what do you think ","ok i'll do that "
14246,120.4,Luis,,"that sounds great do you want to start ","yeah so my answer to the question was that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that "
14248,120.1,Luis,,"that's right but do you know what object did they use to find water in the moon ","i think the same stuff like they use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that i think they used the same thing "
14252,210.4,Farrah,,"so even if you're looking straight to it you wouldn't be able to tell if it was there or not so they needed an equipment that would help them they needed an equipment to look very very close to that little block of ice and then they would see if there is water in there ","yeah i guess i was wondering so it sounds like you were saying that they use something to find the small water and i was thinking that because i said that they must have used the microscope so i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong "
14256,130.3,Chris,,"so it's basically a microscope so they can see really deep in the picture and then the name for it it's lunar orbiter ok ","Oh, I was just wondering because I've been to NASA with my dad, and we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff. So they didn't need that stuff. "
14259,130.3,Oliver,,"but they also bringing a huge machine that it's called lunar orbiter and this is equipment that the scientists brought to the moon it was like a microscope oliveron i mean student sorry ","yeah i just was going to say unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for especially encouraging us to draw on our background knowledge that was really cool to be able to talk about the stuff that we already inaudible thank you for letting us share "
14265,130.3,Luis,,,"so i said that you need a scientific will call a microscope to look really close so i said basically i circled the same thing i student i i said that scientists craters pool of water on the moon i said you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely on yeah and basically what i said was that like you would need to um well okay so nasa has like all this stuff and so basically like you know what i mean you need all this other equip "
14267,130.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so i was just gonna say i kind of know all about space so i don't really think i even need to be on this because i already know all this stuff "
14273,420.2,Chris,,"student and student i'd like to hear more concrete examples of what kind of equipment they use ","well so i went to nasa so i know like from going that scientists use a lot of equipment like student was saying that but they use like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that you know what i mean "
14276,210.4,Luis,,"student can you think of any particular specific examples of equipment that they might use ","yeah okay so yeah okay so i think that what they use was like oxygen tanks and stuff like that like student was saying and i know a lot about space so they probably use like some kind of like pack to like drink water from and like all that kind of stuff "
14279,110.1,Jazmin,,"good job and they're awesome you class really good job thank you all for sharing those specific equipment with me you class did a really good job ","i am just wondering why am i wrong "
14281,110.1,Jazmin,,"no student you did a good job your answer is great the first time ","it was right "
14284,310.1,Chris,,"i pointed out student and student both of you had done a really good job from the beginning naming the exact specific examples of equipment ","um no i just was i raised my hand by accident "
14288,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome ","alright welcome back so oh actually i believe one of the students had something to say hang on one second i'm so thank you for working with us for just a short time but we really wanted to thank you for like even though we only have you for a little bit we wanted to thank you for being so kind and for really making sure that class answered the question and that nobody felt left out so thank you so much "
14291,110.1,Luis,,,"we're good work excited to work with you "
14295,110.1,Luis,,,"um so i was just gonna say that um basically um i i kind of already know like all about space and i know that we're like here in the class to to help us with our answers but i don't think i really belong here as i already know all about "
14298,150.1,Luis,,"too much there's always more that you can learn ","that's cool i guess i can stick around "
14309,210.4,Jazmin,,"And then you are going to use the other colored highlighter to highlight at least two examples. ","because i well i guess we proceed with that is to look to see why my into what's wrong "
14312,410.2,Jazmin,,"actual name of what that machine was so i'd like to see a bit more specific detail to know exactly what that small machine was ","yeah okay i knew what it was i knew that it was "
14317,410.2,Chris,,,"on i think i was just gonna ask like well okay so we with their highlighters we highlight can you tell me again we highlight the things that are that are different i wasn't able to hear you what fortunately "
14320,410.2,Chris,,,"yeah i can hear you "
14323,410.2,Chris,,,"Does that answer your question yeah that's that makes sense Okay, I think I can do that. "
14325,120.3,Oliver,,"awesome i am going to start your two minute timer to read the text really closely if you finish before two minutes go ahead and read it again your two minutes starting now to read ","we can read super fast so we we did our two minutes "
14334,120.3,Oliver,,,"so i just was are we reading the the text as well like through paragraph six or just paragraph one through three "
14338,120.3,Oliver,,,"gotcha okay cool i think we found some cool stuff "
14343,120.4,Farrah,,"let's just go left to right student what do you have for the first question what are some examples of equipment found on the moon ","okay so i highlighted two things first i highlighted the microscope because i thought that was something that you really mean like would be important and then as i was reading closely i saw that like another thing like a piece of equipment that you use on the moon is this thing called the orbiter "
14347,130.2,Chris,,"um to make this a little easier did class have any answers that were different from savannas ","um yeah i think i might be not quite right though but what i said was i said that the the craters i don't know if it's equipment but i thought that maybe you could think of it as equipment because it holds the water you know what i mean "
14354,110.2,Chris,,"it's a very good thought ","Oh so it's the the equipment that like found the water so, even if it was in the crater it's not like the crater was equipment to find it. "
14356,110.2,Oliver,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to our next part but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
14361,220.1,Luis,,"but i think we could do a little bit better and get a lot more of a specific answer so i'm going to have us do the same activity that we did with the first question ","on so i guess like kind of what i was thinking is that like so i learned a lot from our last session and i do that i'm probably pretty good now i think i understand that "
14363,150.1,Luis,,"well there's always always more to learn that's how you get really good at something you don't think that you've learned it all you always have an open mind to learn more ","okay i got it "
14370,420.3,Oliver,,"and then i'm going to give you another minute after to highlight those two examples and then we'll come together and share does class have any questions before we start ","all right "
14375,420.3,Oliver,,"so now i'm giving you highlighters and i want you to go through those sections that you just read and i want you to highlight at least two examples of how water could be a valuable resource on the moon ","all right we got "
14378,420.3,Chris,,,"all right "
14382,210.3,Chris,,"so what two examples in the text did you highlight that shown that water is a valuable resource on the moon ","okay so i saw a couple things that jumped out to me so one thing i saw is that like astronauts could drink the water and like that's really important because like you have to drink water to survive and so that was really important as you could drink the water so that's one thing that's huge and then another thing that's useful is that you can use it to make oxygen to people so like that was saying that maybe they were going to put a moon base on the moon and i was thinking well they could use the water to make oxygen and to breath "
14387,130.2,Luis,,"let's see student did you have anything different today ","um yeah i mean i kind of noticed a couple things so one of the things that i noticed was that like i circled the same thing as student for the first part i put down that you could drink the water because i know how important it is to drink the water but i also said that you could make walk it like that just just out of each to oh i think is the chemical sign for water you can rock it yeah yeah "
14393,110.1,Jazmin,,"those are awesome answers and i was great job knowing that i'm waters chemical was h2o that was awesome student what's up ","and see me a little bit is still in display skin my skin but i can say this one day like quite sure when i'm confused about like i'm not quite sure like a we certainly are we're highlighting the things that we need to do that that like we can use the water for is that right "
14396,110.4,Jazmin,,"yeah that is correct ","okay that makes sense because that makes sense "
14398,210.2,Jazmin,,"let's think of examples of why water is a valuable resource or something that we can use so we are highlighting what are some ways we can use water the water that's on the moon ","oh that's okay "
14403,210.2,Jazmin,,,"i just didn't quite get the question right the first time um yeah so i was thinking about the moon base and i was thinking about the fact that like they were maybe going to do that for 2024 and it made me think a little bit about like they couldn't do a moon base if they did have water because just like student and student were saying like you have to use water to bring but then you can also use water to make rocket fuel and you can use water to make oxygen so you can breathe in the in the space like the little the base on the moon which is pretty cool "
14412,210.3,Jazmin,,"all right you class did an awesome job student after i clarified that for you do you have any new answers ","yeah so okay so i think when i look at it one of the things that jumped out was was interesting so like they said that it might be hard to extract some of the water so it made me think like what kinda you know what i mean like what kind of equipment with the to be able to bring out the water but it seems like because we're able to drill on earth that we would be able to do it so i guess well okay so i guess i understand that like that the water is a big thing that you could drink the water and you can also it sounds like rocket fuel and you can make oxygen and then like to be able to do that like what they have like a couple plans for how they might do it it seems very possible to make it seems like something that they could do and i know that student and depth but maybe it will be a long time before they do it but i guess i think maybe could be done really quickly "
14424,210.1,Oliver,,"i think of a lot of people put their minds to it could be done a lot quicker but there's a lot of things like money and time and just everything that goes into it so hopefully it'll get done sooner than that but ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for helping us first off to like correct our misconceptions because we have a lot of different ideas but they weren't always like accurate so you helped us understand like kind of what we needed to focus on and you also reminded us to use the evidence from the text and like even more than that you asked us about how we were thinking about stuff so when we talk about how we like think about stuff you know what i mean it helps us to sort of figure out how we got the answer and maybe make even better answers next time and um yeah it was really interesting that you you really value our our answers and because of that it was really comfortable to share so it probably we could share out in the class even if we were you know wrong because you would help us to learn like maybe what was more correct that was really cool thank you so much it was really fun "
14428,120.2,Luis,,"before even before i answer your question i'm just gonna review what we're going to go over so we're gonna talk about the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we're going to talk about that student what's your question ","um well i was just gonna say that i know like all the stuff about space so like i don't really think i even need to be in this class "
14430,110.3,Luis,,"well you can you can then if you know questions that you might know the answers to questions that some of i might need help with or some of our classmates might need help with so i think you're going to be a pretty vital part of our class ","yeah sounds really cool "
14432,120.4,Luis,,"yeah all right so student since you said you know a lot about space can you answer the question for us what equipment did scientist use to discover water on the moon from our water on the moon text do you remember what the equipment they used ","well yeah so i was i was saying that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and and stuff like that "
14439,130.2,Farrah,,"that student didn't say how about student what did what did what equipment and i use ","so i believe they use the microscope because you you said that we should look at the text so why i believe that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to see and then the text it's like saying that the waters microscopic so like i think that's it "
14447,210.4,Jazmin,,"who can remember a type of tool that the scientists used while they were on the moon ","and so basically okay so to use the text that you sent so basically i was in say nasa sent this small machine and am i supposed to say like more than that Yeah okay so nasa sentence she called the lunar orbiter to investigate so it's the lunar orbiter right "
14453,110.4,Jazmin,,"That's right. So the scientists did use a tool called the Lunar Orbiter. ","Since I was just i guess i don't understand why my answers were wrong you know what i mean like i my original answer was saying like nasa sent a small machine i was just wondering like what was what what was wrong with that answer "
14457,230.3,Jazmin,,"so student you answered with nasa send a small machine so am i right to say that you you said the equipment they used was a small machine ","yes yes the equipment was the small machine "
14460,210.4,Jazmin,,"about what those small machine is called do you remember what the small machine was called ","yeah okay okay so i think i understand i said nasa sent a small machine but i should have said like what the actual like machine was and the machine was the was the lunar orbiter right "
14463,110.4,Chris,,"exactly ","yeah i just was gonna say i was wondering like scientists like when my dad took me to nasa we saw that scientists use like oxygen tanks and stuff like that and i wondering like did they not use those things "
14470,210.3,Farrah,,"do you think the passage list all the equipment they used or just a few of the common ","i think just some of the equipment because they have lots like hundreds maybe even thousands of pieces of equipment so like how could they you and i mean i think that's the most an unfortunately we have to go to lunch but we don't have much i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for making sure that we were looking at the text and like drawing from the meeting or like what we were saying and also you look help us understand like we were beginning to sort of clarify and things like this is how we thought about this you know what i mean "
14472,210.3,Farrah,,,"helped us make sure that we were on like understanding the keywords in the question and helping us to use evidence from the text in the answer so thank you so much for working with us "
14475,210.3,Luis,,,"Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group. I already know all about space. "
14480,120.2,Farrah,,"oh thank you student right now we are not talking about space we are talking about including evidence to support our answers so do you have anything to share about including evidence ","well i know that we're supposed to do that every time we answer a question Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I do remember that. We learned that if somebody says something, then you can say what they said, I think. OK, I don't know. "
14484,230.2,Farrah,,"student what did you add to your thoughts how are you going to support your thoughts ","ok so when i looked back i actually circled a quote already from the text because my answer was the last sentence in the story "
14489,420.2,Farrah,,"ok so sometimes if we just include the quote we also want to include our own thoughts to make the quote expand our thoughts with the quote so it's kind of two pieces you need is your own thoughts and the author's thoughts or the writer's thoughts ","ms mahoney inaudible yeah "
14491,420.2,Farrah,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14496,150.1,Farrah,,"Does that make sense? ","yeah yeah "
14499,230.1,Luis,,"so did you think about how that knowledge relates to the question and the story that we read ","well how my knowledge relates how my knowledge relates to the question and the story well i mean so i know that the astronauts need equipment in order to go to the moon so that part i feel like that's how my knowledge relates because i know that they need oxygen tanks in order to breathe on the moon "
14501,230.2,Luis,,"and did you find the part of the story that you could quote that said anything about oxygen tanks ","no i couldn't find anything in there "
14505,120.4,Chris,,"yes student do you have something to add ","yeah i mean it's about science though it's not about the story but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
14507,110.3,Chris,,"that's really cool thank you for sharing and maybe when we're doing a bigger writing assignment about this unit we can include some of the details that we already learned from other places like maybe luis's read other books about space and you've been to nasa so that's really cool and i'd love for us to get a chance for you to share that maybe during a show-and-tell ","ok ok that sounds really cool "
14509,120.4,Oliver,,"student do you have anything to add i haven't heard from you ","well i was looking at my answer when you told us to all look for where we found everything but i circled the last sentence just like student so i was just trying to think if what you told student i guess is the same for me "
14513,150.1,Oliver,,"yeah so do you remember what i said to student ","that she's gotta say stuff in her own words she can't just pull the quote from the story Yeah. Ms. Mahoney, I just saw the clock, and it's time for us to go to lunch. This was really short, but I really appreciate how you really helped us think about how we found evidence from the story and our answer or how we needed to add more work and not just the evidence from the story, like me and Farrah. "
14516,150.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
14518,150.1,Luis,,"ok so now hearing back from all of your responses and everything they sound amazing but we do have to talk a little bit about getting our minds a little bit deeper in the text yes student i believe ","yeah it's me student excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
14520,110.3,Luis,,"and that's ok sometimes we need to know a little bit deeper and maybe just help our other classmates to understand just what we're talking about and maybe get our minds going a little bit ","ok "
14526,210.4,Farrah,,"what was one of the tools scientists used a specific tool ","yeah i said that they used the microscope Yeah, in paragraph 3. "
14530,230.2,Farrah,,"now when student found that did you look at the text and reread it to notice that they said a scientific tool ","oh well i noticed that the first time because i was looking for the word equipment and then i didn't see equipment so when i was looking for it i was looking for anything else that might be equipment and also that it talks about water and so that's how i found it there but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14536,420.2,Jazmin,,"but maybe we can use another tool like rereading through all of the text right and then if we reread through the text we can find a little bit more details and maybe even more of the tools that came up within the article ","they said that nasa sent a small machine "
14538,420.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah i said that nasa sent a small machine "
14541,130.3,Jazmin,,"so that is just another specific way of looking to see in the text what's happening so like you student you explained that they sent a small machine but if we use the tool of rereading the text we would have seen that there was a name for it which is the lunar orbiter ","oh yeah ok i see that one right there yeah ok i see that "
14545,420.2,Chris,,"so that would have helped out your answer and made it a little bit more specific so you're not wrong it is a small machine but just to add a little bit more detail and clarification so it's nice and clear ","ok ok well i went to nasa it's me student right here i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits like lots of different equipment that they need to use to go to the moon "
14548,120.4,Chris,,"that is right now student would you like to share your answer ","yeah sure i said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
14551,420.2,Chris,,"so even though you do have your background knowledge that we activated and even though you know that they use a lot of different tools maybe we could just look through the article to find what they specifically used ","the lunar orbiter or the microscope so my answer is wrong "
14553,420.2,Chris,,"to answer the actual question which is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon we just need to go in a little bit more detail and make sure that we're rereading the text to answer the question ","ok ok ok "
14557,210.2,Oliver,,"but maybe we just need to look at the question a little bit further to know that we need to focus on the tools we're going to focus on the tools ","ok ok miss lisa it's time for us to go to lunch i know it's been a very short time but i wanted to say i appreciate how you helped us look for more evidence in the text to put into our answers so thank you bye "
14560,210.2,Farrah,,,"hi good to see you "
14563,150.1,Luis,,"good to see you too so right now we're going to kind of discuss your responses that you had about the the story about not the story the reading about the moon ","um yeah i was just gonna say like i already know like all there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to even be in this class "
14568,210.3,Farrah,,"so i'm student in your response you kind of talked about a tool did you want to kind of expand and talk with that tool and what it does ","yeah okay so i i said i was talking about the microscope is the tool that they use and i think that because of what they said in the beginning reach every reader he said in paragraph three you wouldn't be able to see it for the water is microscopic you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so i'm thinking that they could how could they find the water if they can't see the water you know what i mean "
14571,210.4,Oliver,,"have any of you class ever used a microscope before ","and yeah i've used it "
14573,210.4,Oliver,,"what kinds of things have you used a microscope on ","yeah yeah in science class last year we we saw mr anderson use one and like was he was looking at i think it was like i think he was looking at his spit or something it was like something like that we were looking at like really close "
14577,110.2,Chris,,"so that's a tool that we that you can implement in your responses yes student ","Actually yeah I was gonna ask. So I, I noticed that like when i was like went to nasa that scientists use oxygen tanks at masks and stuff like that i was wondering like where does that fit in "
14582,210.3,Jazmin,,"Jazmin, you actually mentioned it in your or just mentioned a small machine in your response. Do you want to kind of broaden that a little bit. ","yeah when you say how would i broaden what would that look like "
14585,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay so when you say nasa send a small machine do you know exactly what that machine was called ","yeah yeah it was called the lunar orbiter "
14588,420.2,Farrah,,"So that could be useful in your response. ","oh i guess i was wondering why my answer was wrong "
14592,210.4,Farrah,,"what are we looking closely at ","we're looking at the water on the moon "
14594,420.2,Farrah,,"you might want to add that into your answer as well to be very concrete and make sure you're using all your resources from the passage ","so like "
14598,530.1,Oliver,,"so what would you with our discussion today what would you say your answer would be and how would it change ","Mmm hmm. Well, I guess. Okay, so if Farrah was like kind of something like Talking about the scientific tool and like more complete is like something. it uses academic language by like how do i know which language you use "
14606,530.1,Farrah,,,"Oh, well, actually I was just gonna say that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch. have before we go i just wanted to add like in particular i wanted to thank you for encouraging us to use the text and also like that you were helping us you were very positive as we were trying to think about our answers thank you so much "
14608,530.1,Farrah,,,"thank you "
14610,530.1,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know a lot about space "
14615,110.3,Jazmin,,"you'd be a really great resource for us so why don't you hang tight ","no i don't remember "
14618,210.4,Jazmin,,"why did they send the lunar orbiter ","oh yeah i see that nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits and so it can land at the south pole and look for ice to pass it in a large polar crater "
14620,420.2,Jazmin,,"great so incorporating that information in your answer really shows me that you understand the reading so i think that would be a great detail to add in your answers ","to write down all i'm sorry you think i have to write down all of those words "
14622,420.2,Jazmin,,"but if you can put that sentence into your own words that shows me that you understand ","um you're saying i have to take a big long sentence and then i have to write it but not copy down the exact same word "
14629,150.1,Jazmin,,"Does that make sense. Is that a little easier. ","yeah i guess that's a few less words okay "
14631,150.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
14637,210.4,Farrah,,"why do they need a microscope to look really closely ","oh much i'm not sure "
14640,210.4,Farrah,,"based on what you already know what is a microscope ","yeah yeah a microscope is is what you use in science class to look at really small thing "
14642,210.4,Farrah,,,"it's really small "
14644,420.2,Farrah,,"it's really small so saying that in your answer shows me that you understand what a microscope is and that you know that the water on the moon is really small and that you got all that information from reading the passage ","ok ok "
14646,420.2,Farrah,,,"okay i think so you're saying kind of like student where i gotta i gotta put it in i gotta say more stuff in my own words maybe "
14650,230.1,Oliver,,"so deb you said you circled the same thing as student what is what does that mean to you why did you highlight that answer ","well cause when you asked class to say their answers and student said hers and i realized that she had the same thing that i had i talked about the microscope and the story the part where it says that they they arm you need assigned the last sentence you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's the same thing but i circled in my answer to "
14652,230.1,Oliver,,"can you explain a little bit more why you circle that ","yeah possible question asked about equipment and asked about looking at water and when i read the story that i only saw this was the only time where they talked about an equipment looking at the water "
14662,210.4,Oliver,,"could you tell me what equipment they used to find the water in the craters ","student said the microscope student said i'm a small machine i think i think you said the lunar orbiter um i guess it's one of those i mean i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits mm hmm "
14670,410.2,Oliver,,"but we need to highlight the equipment that they used ","i'm excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thank you so much for giving all of us suggestions on how we can improve our answers and how you you listen to all of our ideas and suggestions i were different for each one of us so thank you "
14673,120.2,Luis,,"all right class so you just answered a question for me about our water on the moon passage or question was what equipment and scientists you should discover water on the moon so i want to talk about a couple of your answers so let's start with student oh student you have a question ","i guess i was just gonna say that i i i don't think that i need to be in that class because i don't think i need any help because i already don't our space "
14675,110.3,Luis,,"i'm so glad that you know a lot about space but i think you staying in our class would really benefit our other classmates because maybe you could share some information that you already know about space that sounds good ","awesome yeah that sounds great i'm super into that "
14678,230.2,Jazmin,,"good all right i'm going to call on student first let's talk about student answer so you told me that nasa send a small machine now where did you get that information ","i could click to when i will do a new paragraph and it basically said paragraph to that let's see nasa send a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investing so i thought this small machine was what they used to find the water "
14685,230.1,Oliver,,"All right, yeah of course Okay, so you told me that you circled the same answer Farrah could you tell me what the answer was. ","um yeah so basically i was saying that they use the microscope in order to find the water because you know they couldn't they couldn't find the water unless they could see "
14689,420.2,Oliver,,"so like i told for student when you're giving answers you want to make sure you have your evidence to back up your statement as well ","cool yeah i can do that "
14691,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah i was just kind of thinking as i was listening to you talking to oliveron class i guess i was still confused because you know in our class this is to help us to understand better um i guess they don't understand like why my answer is like not correct why it's wrong "
14698,410.2,Farrah,,"we need to be able to know the equipment that we use to find the water first before we analyze it ","oh i'm sorry "
14702,410.2,Farrah,,,"well i was just wondering like you i i guess it kind of had in my imagination like there was an astronaut who had a microscope and wasn't looking at the at the water but student was saying that there was something else that they use so maybe they didn't have any instruments "
14710,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense ","yeah so they use like some other kind of equipment or tracker or something like the student said the lunar orbiter that's what found the right and then they looked at the water maybe later after they found it so they didn't use the microscope buying the um so I guess, I was just picking. up because i went to nasa and i know that scientists is a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and sutent thing i was wondering where that fits in to the reading "
14718,210.4,Chris,,"And then that came back to a lab and then the scientists in the lab use the different equipment like maybe a microscope to look at the water that the Lunar orbiter connected from the moon, so it all goes together, like a big web of ideas everything connects. ","oh okay that makes a lot of sense so like okay so if there was an astronaut on food maybe they use that but the truth is that they did it is that right they didn't eat an astronaut because they sent the small sheet yeah that makes a lot of. "
14720,210.4,Jazmin,,,"my next class but before we go i just wanted to thank you for working with us this is really cool because i think we understand a lot more thank you so much "
14724,230.2,Chris,,"so can you tell me where in the passage you found that answer where did you get it from ","yeah okay so basically when i looked at the end it ended i see it oh in paragraph one on it says that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these traders are dark places where the sun never shot so that's where i saw the part about "
14731,210.3,Chris,,"so knowing that now now that we've rerouted do you think you would change your answer ","yeah i guess because the question was what equipment right did they use so i guess i was talking about the craters because i was thinking that like that's where they had the water you know and i mean with the craters so but the question is what was used is that right "
14733,110.1,Chris,,"yeah you're absolutely right so we talked about that ","we so "
14736,110.1,Chris,,,"yeah so i guess i would say like the equipment that they use so it sounds like they use if i was listening to class it sounds like they use on the lunar orbiter to find it and then they use the microscope to to study "
14741,210.4,Chris,,"So instead of saying it's full of water, the craters are full of water, there was a tiny bit in there that we can look further into using our equipment or microscope all right. ","oh i see yeah "
14743,150.1,Chris,,"that make more sense ","yeah that makes a lot "
14745,120.4,Luis,,"awesome student what's your question ","um so i was just gonna say that this has been really fun and i think that i've got it all figured out so i "
14752,230.2,Luis,,"can you show me where you found that ","that's a that's a really good question um i guess let me look at see i'm well i don't see any oxygen tanks i guess i was using what i do because you know i visited nasa and i'm even student and i went together with his dad and so we saw that astronauts have to use the oxygen tanks but i remember you said that maybe there weren't any astronauts at all so maybe they didn't need oxygen "
14756,130.1,Luis,,"but i don't think it answers this specific question and you understand ","yeah i think so that you gotta do what "
14763,120.4,Jazmin,,"what's going on student ","i was just when i was thinking about this when i think about and i'm like well they it says like what equipment to they used to discover the water and i'm thinking like well obviously they use the lunar orbiter have to discover it but like i guess in this case it seems like there should be more information like a lunar orbiter like probably has blocked it experiments but like what are the instruments like how do they find water without without seeing it with a microscope like i can simply use the mask "
14768,210.4,Jazmin,,"the lunar orbiter looks for the ice deposits in the polar craters ","yeah like the idea that like student and student and they were saying that like even i mean like you need other stuff like you up astronauts and other things like that and i guess it just got me wondering like could you use this to find water or do you just need to use the lunar orbiter "
14770,110.1,Jazmin,,"i think that's a great question and i don't think that our reading answers your question completely so that would be a great question to write down and maybe you can we can do some more research about it ","okay "
14774,120.4,Oliver,,"all right dave do you have a question ","um yeah i guess for me i so i read that they weren't going to put a moon base on the moon maybe by 2024 that was the goal and i was wondering like did they will they like us to you know what i mean to have water for the moon base "
14777,110.1,Oliver,,"you class have lots of great questions and i think you know a little bit more than i do even about what's going on up in space but they definitely my i think that's in like i said for student that's a great question to write down that we can look into as we talk more about ","that "
14784,110.1,Farrah,,,"so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to take a moment and i wanted to thank you for working with us today and i in particular i wanted to thank you for pushing us to think about what we were saying like you really the first you really listen to what we said so you didn't like cut us off you like really heard what we were saying you let us talk to each other about like what we thought about each other and but you helped us to really understand like what you were looking for and so as a result i feel like we were able to have a really like in depth conversation which was really fun interesting i feel really interested by this stuff that we've covered to thank you so much it was really fun to work with wasn't it oh yeah it was awesome thank you so much bye bye bye "
14790,230.3,Farrah,,"and student i noticed that in your response you actually talked about microscopes which help the scientists to see things closer is that sure you said that right in your response ","yeah that was my response yeah "
14798,210.4,Oliver,,"Answer to Farrah, so do. Is there any tool or gadget that you could think of that would be helpful to have on an orbiter. ","um yeah so i agree with student and i thought basically that like um you know you would need the microscope because they said in the reading that the water was microscopic and you couldn't see it with your eyes and so i was thinking like the scientists would have to bring a microscope with them to see the water and so i guess that's how they found the water "
14801,120.4,Luis,,"student do you have anything to add i see your hands raised ","um yeah i was just gonna say that honestly like i already know all about space i don't think i need any help i don't even think i should be in this "
14807,120.4,Chris,,"Could anyone answer that. ","oh that's a really that's an interesting question um "
14810,120.4,Chris,,"yeah student go ahead you can respond ","um well i was gonna say that i went to nasa so like with my dad and so i noticed that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks but it sounds like you're telling us that the lunar orbiter went without any astronaut is that right "
14812,120.4,Jazmin,,"Jazmin, is there anything that you want to add ","so basically just what i was gonna say was i wasn't sure why my answer was well "
14816,210.4,Luis,,"and does class remember from the text what the lunar orbiter does ","um well the lunar orbiter like it goes up to the moon and orbits the moon and it studies like different things like beams down stuff and maybe it sends a rover but it like goes down and looks at like what's happening on the "
14824,120.4,Farrah,,"student do you have anything you want to add ","Oh, I think I was going to answer the question before, but actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for working with us and in particular i wanted to thank you for asking us to use evidence in what we were like saying because that way we were able to back it up using the text and like you were helping us to really understand what the question was and i think some of us didn't know quite what what the question was looking at like the question was saying like you know if the lunar orbiter was was what they used to invest and discover and i think that also like you really helped us to like build value i think we all felt like our opinions were really worthwhile so thank you so much for working with us bye "
14826,120.4,Oliver,,,"all work good and we're excited to work with you "
14829,120.4,Luis,,,"yeah there's nothing i am kind of know like all this stuff already so like i don't really think i need any help i don't need to be in this class "
14836,210.3,Farrah,,"do you remember from the passage what the scientists are using this tool to look at ","yeah you're looking at the microscopic water on the moon "
14842,210.3,Jazmin,,"yes small machine the name of that small machine if you look back into paragraph two it actually tells us the name of this machine ","I was acutally kind of confused, because I wasn't sure, we're all here because maybe our answers are not fully right. So, I was kind of wondering like, why is my answer wrong. "
14850,150.1,Luis,,"and we can help each other by doing that by listening to our peers and coming together to make a stronger answer ","yeah so what i realized that student and i okay we both were talking earlier like luis's answer about how the scientists use lots of equipment so i was gonna say i'm watching student do you want to say your answer um yeah so here was the thing like scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and suits and masks and that stuff so i was thinking like you know like maybe the the reading was missing important like things like do you know what i mean because how could the scientists be up there like getting water if they don't have a spacesuit "
14859,120.4,Oliver,,"what class else want to share their answer student i know you had a similar answer to what student said is there anything else you'd like to add to the class answer ","um so yeah i thought that student was right and i i found that evidence myself what i noticed was that the microscope okay so student and i talked and we said that you can't find the water if you can't see it like you'll have to be able to see the water so we thought like how could they discover the water unless they use the microscope first "
14861,130.1,Oliver,,"exactly there's a possibility that the lunar that there's a microscope on the lunar orbiter that helps us look at the ashes on the moon ","oh that's all "
14866,150.1,Chris,,"is there class would want to add anything to our conversation yes student ","so i kind of was just well okay so i was thinking about that i went to nasa so i like you were saying i know that scientists use a lot of equipment oxygen tanks and masks and suits things like that so it kind of was making me think like did they not use those to discover the water like they use those like you were saying in the second reading "
14875,210.4,Farrah,,"now can someone give me information on a microscope what does it say that the microscope does can you look into your paragraph and find that and then you class raise your hand and then you class could share with the class ","okay basically i'm sorry unfortunately we have to go to our next class but we really wanted to thank you for working with us this was really fun thank you "
14880,120.4,Jazmin,,"coule you repeat your question to your classmates your answer your responses to your classmates ","yeah so basically my response was that water is valuble because astronauts keep drinking water and the water help them stay hydrated you can't survive without water right paragraph four were actually going to hear to have evidence for what you just said "
14883,120.3,Jazmin,,"would be a valuable or very important resource it could be useful in lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink the water like you said right water is ","yeah "
14889,130.3,Luis,,"do you know what this is look into paragraph for the sentence after it says it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft it tells us why it would be good for us to have water on the moon yes student ","so yeah i kind of know all about this i think i am good "
14891,120.3,Luis,,"would you be able to read that last sentence for us then as a class ","yeah i would love to read that sounds great okay i'm in paragraph five is that right "
14893,120.3,Luis,,,"okay having water available on the moon we need more room on the spacecraft people and things like oxygen tanks "
14896,210.4,Chris,,"so this paragraph is that water is valuable because on the moon water becomes valuable because then astronauts don't have to carry the heavy water inside the spacecraft ","well they have room for kind of other stuff so maybe they want to bring different kinds of food or maybe more likely they want to bring like other equipment and stuff like that "
14898,110.1,Luis,,"exactly student could you now respond and tell us your answer ","yeah yeah i would love to so okay my answer and i actually this way but i also saw in the reading because i did look at the reading this time teacher um i did look at it and i saw that the water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
14900,210.3,Luis,,"yes so evidence from the text shows us tell us that water can be broken down into two parts like you said hydrogen and oxygen and which one of those two do the astronauts use for breathing student ","oxygen "
14905,210.4,Farrah,,"we also talked about the bottom talks about how we can use hydrogen for something else ","Okay. it says that you can use hydrogen you can use it to make rocket "
14913,120.4,Oliver,,"before heading out into the solar system so let's review why water is valuable and i know that student had a response as well what was your response before we go over the reasons why water is valuable ","well so i actually have my opinion is that water um yeah i can see that it's valuable like it's not that it's not valuable but it's not ready yet like they talk in the reading a lot at the end about how hard it would be to figure out like how to even like find the water like they said in the first reading that like it was like there's just like little microscopic particles of it and you have to somehow get out of the dirt and out of the craters and all this stuff like that's really hard like we don't have something that can just do that we'd have to invent it and build it so i kind of am thinking that the evidence is not convincing because just because the waters there doesn't mean that we can use it "
14918,210.3,Oliver,,"But if you are an astronaut, think about yourself if you were an astronaut wouldn't you want to enable it you found it, even if it was a little amount of water. ","yeah i yeah i i do think it's valuable but i think because i was trying to read the question really closely like we did last time and because it's saying like is the evidence convincing i don't think it is i think that the evidence says that the waters like i think it will be valuable in the future but i don't think it's valuable "
14921,310.1,Chris,,"i love how you were challenging the question itself ","I was gonna say I think Oliver and I were talking about this, that they are going to maybe try to make up base by 2024 so maybe they will figure it out by that. "
14929,110.3,Jazmin,,"yeah that's our hopes right scientists works really hard ","reach every reader well i just wanna say that i was a little bit confused because i thought the water was valuable as a defense argument i actually really think it's a good argument but i think you could argue both ways like i think you could say that it's not valuable because yeah because it's really hard to get it out of the way but i think you could also say is valuable because like sometimes right like you know like my dad works for like my dad works for oil companies so like they know that they sometimes look for oil and they don't know where it is yet but it's valuable even if they don't have it yet so maybe "
14937,230.3,Oliver,,"how is what student said change your thinking so even though it's hard to get merged she said the oil better product strategy part to get ","yeah that's a really good point, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but before we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for working with us i'd like, in particular, I really wanted to thank you for helping us clear up like any kind of misconception we had and making sure that we use evidence in our answers and also um you really valued all of our answers so i think that class had time to explain their ideas and i think like right class like class thought value right like class was like we all felt really like heard and then like thank you so much for helping us understand like what we needed to work on because you gave us ideas for how we could improve our answers in both of our classes so that was so awesome thank you so much and bye "
14939,220.1,Luis,,"well hello okay so i just heard all of your awesome responses and i just want to know a little bit more what you've got from the text so i'm going to start yes what's up student ","asked me i shouldn't be and that's great i already know all about space "
14947,210.3,Oliver,,"so deb what is something else that you notice from the text or from the question like what can you expand on your answer a little bit ","yeah okay so when i was reading the text and i was looking at the question let's talk ask for evidence right that scientists use and some tools some equipment and so i was reading and i was looking for equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment equipment oh and then i saw about the microscope fit to the tool and i was like oh that's equipment so i'm probably right and they were talking about looking at water so so yeah so that's how i got there "
14954,130.2,Jazmin,,"think so no okay does class else want to say something real quick ","well i guess i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
14958,110.2,Jazmin,,"no i'm not saying your answers wrong ","um well i mean i just i i feel like i i put words down from from story and so "
14962,210.4,Jazmin,,"did you notice a name of the equipment that they were using to look for the water ","to investigate the lunar orbiter good "
14965,210.4,Farrah,,"have you seen a microscope before ","oh yeah yeah we we use it in in and miss smith science class "
14969,210.4,Chris,,"does class know what you use microscopes for ","so in this miss class we've been looking at like an amoeba and really small thing so we use a microscope to look at stuff that we can't really see i mean we can see it but like we can see it like like a whole lot more it's really kind of like you know expanded or or or closer up in the microscope "
14979,210.4,Luis,,"have you ever used a microscope before ","um well not before that class no um i mean i've seen it on tv and stuff but we don't have one at my house Oh wow, yeah. Yeah, that'd be man. I think so. Cool. to see like water up close on a microscope and see like what it looks like that'd be real cool yeah "
14982,110.1,Chris,,"awesome ","i went to nasa so i know that's high does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too so lots of different equipment that they use "
14988,140.1,Farrah,,"student what about you would you want to or would you not ","oh yeah definitely i think it'd be like really really cool to go to space and to see the moon and maybe like walk on the moon yeah that would be great "
14991,130.2,Jazmin,,"awesome what about student what do you think about that ","i mean i think it might be cool to go to space but i feel like if we make it too easy to go to space and that'll make it too easy for class on earth to just you know like to keep destroying our planet because the planet is dying and class is just kind of giving up on it and figuring they'll just go and like live on mars or something and so maybe we shouldn't make it so easy to go to space "
14999,130.2,Oliver,,"that's a good idea no thought student did you wanna chime in on anything i know ","i'm nah i'm just chillin chillin back oh excuse me teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking some time with us and for helping us to bring him some of our background knowledge and true book for classroom "
15001,130.2,All,,,"thank you class "
15006,230.1,Luis,,"for a couple of you class so deb could you go more in depth with your answer i know you did circle the same as student but i want to know why you did or if you had something else you wanted to add to yeah ","sure sure okay let me look at what i circled in a story excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15008,110.3,Oliver,,"well honestly i think that you could be a great resource for your class members and you could help them maybe like come up with our own answers or maybe tell them what you think to ","okay i found it so it was in the um third paragraph "
15012,110.3,Oliver,,,"i was looking for um you know like water on the moon and finding water and a tool and so they talk about the scientific tool which is like equipment "
15014,110.3,Oliver,,,"and that paragraph they talk about the water they found is microscopic so we've got equipment and finding water and that's "
15016,230.1,Oliver,,"awesome so what do you think the answer was just to make sure that i'm hearing you correctly ","um they used a microscope to find water on the moon "
15021,130.2,Luis,,"let me see does class want to help her out or point to where it was in the article ","i had microscope i said i said oxygen tank so i don't know what the small machine was that she was talking about "
15023,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay i'm student do you remember what you were thinking about when you were saying the machine before looking ","i'm looking at the story now so i can see it it says nasa small machine caught a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15026,130.2,Jazmin,,"let me see who else i ","still don't understand why my answers wrong "
15028,110.2,Jazmin,,"no i was just wondering like what if you remember the name because that is correct that they did send that to find like if the water was on the moon ","so it is right "
15031,130.1,Jazmin,,"part of it ","oh ok "
15033,130.1,Jazmin,,,"wait but we still have four minutes "
15038,230.1,Farrah,,"student do you want to talk about more about what you were talking about before do you have a house ","yeah cuz i guess i was just trying i was listening to what you said to student no i don't remember what your sentence was student that that teacher helps you to make um i said man i don't remember what i said either let me look up a story "
15041,230.1,Farrah,,,"the water with a microscopic okay but if if student is right that means i'm right but then "
15046,130.3,Farrah,,"so what i thought would be the answer i was answering it would be the lunar orbiter and they use the microscope to actually find the water so i thought it would be both ","okay okay so we're both right "
15049,150.1,Chris,,"does class else want to add into it or thought that they saw something interesting in the reading yes ","i worked at nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
15051,110.3,Chris,,"uh huh oh that's cool yeah ","um well you didn't you didn't say anything about my answer is my answer right "
15055,120.4,Chris,,"i can read it to you yeah sure could you read it to me real quick sure ","i wrote scientist on craters full of water on the moon "
15062,130.1,Chris,,"your answer is a great start okay oh ","will be super microscope and student set the lunar orbiter so i guess i could "
15064,130.1,Chris,,,"for water on the moon with a microscope or the lunar orbiter "
15066,420.2,Chris,,"yeah you could add those two equipments maybe you could start a new sentence with them just add in that those were two equipments that they used to discover water on the moon ","okay so i'll just add that in and then maybe i'll make another sentence but i think i can just "
15068,420.2,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry it's time for us to go to lunch "
15071,150.1,Luis,,"okay so great job explaining um that you class think or did not think that water could be valuable on the moon for astronauts but i guess student okay ","i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
15074,230.1,Farrah,,"i just was wondering so you said no not for a long time what was your thinking when saying that like did you not find any information from the article that might have helped you well i don't ","know i think i was thinking that because the article says that it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of money so that means that you can't use it for a long time "
15077,210.3,Farrah,,"so i do agree with you but maybe we could like talk about that if if we had the resources to make that quicker do you think it would help the astronauts have water on the moon instead of bringing it on their ship or now well i mean if they could do it faster and quicker than ","yeah but the story says that that it it'll take a long time "
15081,230.1,Oliver,,"okay what about you def could you like tell me more about what you were thinking about when saying your answer before yeah ","well i said it's not ready yet because the same thing on okay at the end of the story it says scientists need to come up with a plan for tracking so they don't have a plan and that says making less plan will take a lot of time and money no but that sounds like that water it's not ready yet "
15084,130.2,Jazmin,,"or yeah yeah okay great does class else want to add anything maybe student or student ","okay i'm still kind of confused "
15089,130.2,Jazmin,,,"so anyway right what they said no because it's not i didn't even realize and the last paragraph where they talk about how much money and time it'll take i didn't i didn't think about that "
15091,130.2,Jazmin,,,"maybe mine is not right "
15103,130.2,Jazmin,,"about student can you read yours and then we can maybe like a grief we wanted to add something to it or maybe take something away okay so i ","said yes actually that's can drink the water and stay hydrated you can't survive without water "
15105,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you remember if there was anything from the article that told us if the water was used is there anything else that it can be used for ","um i know they said the thing about drinking it because i got that street from this text "
15109,130.2,Luis,,"drink this water does class else remember from the text what the water can be used for drinking and there was one more thing ","i wrote about curing it but i guess you can't that's not what it's used for Okay, I I did say that it could be split into two parts, hydrogen oxygen. "
15116,210.4,Chris,,"yeah so i remember when i was reading the text that it was talking about how it can be used for fuel ","I forgot about that part yeah I did read that part. And you know I read that there was there could be a base on the moon by 2024. yeah cuz, then the thing about carrying the water wouldn't be an issue okay astronauts could breathe oxygen hydrogen also be used as rocket fuel oh that's what you said. "
15124,210.3,Farrah,,"with the information that we just talked about all together ","ok "
15126,210.3,Farrah,,,"okay i think i got one "
15129,210.3,Farrah,,,"water will be valuable for a long time but when it is they can make rocket fuel and they can breathe oxygen "
15136,130.3,Oliver,,"and they can drink the water right oh yeah and they can drink the water yeah awesome ","i was pretty good let me see you're sad you're sad the hydrogen oxygen is that rocket fuel you said breathing mm hmm all the last sentence maybe when it's ready mm hmm they could make a gas station out in a solar system "
15140,210.4,Oliver,,"what if there were a gas station like on the moon ","oh oh okay i just saw the time it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you teacher for helping us keep trying to find the evidence and a text to fill out our answers "
15142,210.4,Oliver,,,"okay it is by teacher "
15146,210.4,Farrah,,"what are they looking closely at ","oh the water Uh, I don't know where. The water they found on the moon, I guess. "
15148,210.4,Farrah,,"so let's read paragraph one again it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so based off of that where do we think the water is being found ","in the craters "
15150,110.1,Luis,,"in the craters perfect ok and ","excuse me ms kelsey "
15152,110.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15154,150.1,Luis,,"ok that's great that you know a lot about space but this is a specific part of space that we just want to talk about being in this class doesn't mean you don't know about it it just means that i just wanted to hear a little bit more of what you thought ok ","oh ok "
15156,230.1,Luis,,"so let's actually go to you now student so you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks what other equipment have they used on the moon with the water ","well they have to wear spacesuits and gravity boots so that they can walk i'm not sure what other equipment they need "
15158,210.4,Luis,,"from the text can you tell me what the machine is and what it does ","uh huh ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater ok so it's a lunar orbiter and it investigates "
15160,210.4,Luis,,"great job what does it investigate ","ice deposits "
15162,230.1,Jazmin,,"perfect great student i see that you were talking about a small machine is that the machine you were talking about ","yeah so i don't understand why my answer's wrong "
15164,230.1,Jazmin,,"it's not wrong at all i would just like to hear a little bit more detail i want to know a lot more of what you know about it so tell me about the machine ","ok ok i don't remember nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate ok so it's a small machine and it's called a lunar orbiter and it investigates "
15166,210.4,Jazmin,,"what does it investigate ","whispering the lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits ice deposits "
15174,210.4,Jazmin,,"awesome and why do you think it looks for ice deposits what would the ice deposits tell us ","if it's cold there If the water's frozen? No, because it's just frozen water. Uh huh, yeah. "
15176,230.2,Chris,,"good ok and let's go to student student you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i like that that is very true can you just tell me a little bit more about that and where in the text it said that ","yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits but the crater part was in the beginning of the story whispering no atmosphere oh here it is ok scientists found evidence that water could be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
15178,110.3,Chris,,"well i love you bringing in your background knowledge saying that you've been to nasa before that's really cool ","yeah me and my dad went "
15182,230.1,Chris,,"that's really cool i love that did you learn about the lunar orbiter at all when you were at nasa ","no no we saw the mars rover but i don't remember seeing anything about a lunar orbiter What did they do with the water that they found on the moon? I don't know, maybe they drank it. "
15184,210.4,Chris,,"well let's look at this sentence right here it says that the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it so what would they have to do with the water to know that it was there if it was too small to see ","well this says that you need a microscope to look at it "
15186,210.3,Chris,,"right so let's go back to your response real fast you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon so if there's just a little teeny tiny bit of water that you have to look through a microscope to see are the craters really full of water ","no i guess not but the story did say that it was like deep in the craters "
15188,130.2,Oliver,,"yeah student can you help us out a little bit i see you raising your hand ","well i'm sorry to interrupt i was just saying that it's actually time for us to go to lunch i know it was a really short time but i do appreciate how you helped us really look for the evidence in the story to put in our answer "
15191,130.2,Farrah,,,"all right "
15194,130.2,Luis,,,"um so yeah i was just gonna say like i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i think i'm right i think i should go go out "
15198,120.4,Luis,,"is a kind of the process of what you did to correct your answer okay so why don't we start with student student so can you tell me the difference between your original answer and your second answer ","um yeah ok so my initial answer i was saying that scientists like use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that which i knew because i already knew that and then um well basically then i did the reading and looked at the reading and once i did the reading i saw that the that the scientists actually well the real answer is that scientists found ice using a small machine "
15204,230.1,Luis,,"the difference between the two answers and what looking back at looking back at the reading told you can you tell me the ","um well i guess cuz it has to do with the reading because the first time i didn't read it i just knew the answer but i guess that wasn't the right answer so i decided to actually read it and then when i read it i got the right answer "
15207,520.1,Luis,,"right so next time you get a question on a text are you going to use your background knowledge and not read the text at all or are you going to read the text and then use your background knowledge ","i know a lot about space so i might still use the background knowledge but i mean i should probably read it because maybe i don't know everything "
15209,520.1,Farrah,,,"i change my answer to "
15212,120.4,Farrah,,"great so why don't you tell me a little bit about your answers ","okay so basically i said that initially you need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely and then i said after like we were in class and discussing it and i thought about it i said scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon so i found the right answer "
15215,230.1,Farrah,,"right so why do you think that your second answer was the right answer ","because in the first instance i only said that well i said the microscope but that's not the piece of it that actually found the ice the water like you like you could study the ice in a microscope when it was the lunar orbiter that actually found the water "
15218,230.3,Farrah,,"place i really like that and i agree so what i'm hearing is that you look back at the question and kind of reread it and saw your mistakes um or what you could improv a little bit right ","yeah and it was what people were saying to cuz i was listening in class for saying like student was saying it was a small machine and you know stuff like that so um you know other people had ideas too so i was kind of listening to that and then i was when i understood like what the question meant then i could understand better "
15220,520.1,Farrah,,"right so what are a few things we can do next time when you're not quite sure if your answers are all the way there yet ","right ask the teacher "
15224,130.2,Chris,,"or student do you have any suggestions ","on not not about this no i was gonna say that i was gonna say i asked my new answer is ok "
15227,120.4,Chris,,"yeah so why don't you tell me a little bit about your two answers ","okay so what i said was initially that scientists found craters full of water on the moon and then i realized that that it wasn't full of water when i read it more closely i said instead that the the water that scientists found on the moon was microscopic there was only a little bit like i said initially there was like lots of it but actually there's just a little bit of water "
15229,230.1,Chris,,"good and how did you come to that conclusion ","um well i was because i'm the well because the teacher asked about it and what i was like asking if it was a lot of water or a little water and i was saying well actually it was when i had to go back you i saw that it was just a little bit of water "
15231,520.1,Chris,,"right so you went back and read so what do you want to do next time a teacher asks you for a little bit more information ","i guess i just won't go back yet "
15233,520.1,Oliver,,,"um unfortunately we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun bye "
15237,120.4,Luis,,"hi so student can you tell me a little bit about your answer ","oh yeah okay so i can i can tell you that basically i was saying that yeah that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
15241,110.1,Luis,,"that's really good information ","yeah okay it says is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable "
15249,410.1,Luis,,"What. ","Well, I guess it's answering the question because well it is valuable right like it's really valuable that um that they have like. you know that you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen like that's why i mentioned it because those are really valuable things in space because you can do all kinds of stuff with them "
15252,420.2,Luis,,"a way that i could see you making a response even better is kind of adding the question into the response so you could say one way that the water is valuable is you can split it into hydrogen and oxygen ","yeah that makes that makes sense yeah "
15254,120.4,Farrah,,"good i'm glad okay i'm student why don't you tell me a little bit about your answer now ","okay so i said that no i'm like it like would not be valuable not like for a long time "
15259,230.1,Farrah,,"right um can you tell me a little bit why you think that ","yeah cuz well basically like um well first off like they only have a little bit of it and it spread over like all sorts of places like it sort of in craters but it's also kind of all over and we don't really have the technology to like go and like kind of find everything and like dig it out like it would take so much energy to do it that it doesn't seem like it would be very possible like it seems like we need to invent new technology to really be able to use the water on the moon "
15263,420.2,Farrah,,"go back and try and find a little bit of evidence in the text as to why you think the answer is correct okay ","gotcha "
15265,120.4,Oliver,,"okay and student can we talk about your answer a little bit tell me what you answered ","yeah so i said i'm like student i said no because it's not ready yet "
15272,230.1,Oliver,,"why it's not ready ","yeah cuz well we know that the water is super small it's microscopic and it's really like all mixed in with dirt and everything so like i'm thinking that like you can't really use it you'd have to do something to it but like you it's not like just sitting there ready to be used on like hooked up to a gas tank or something so you'd have to get it ready but it seems like it would be really hard to get it ready um well I guess Okay, so I could try. with evidence so i think that i would just say like no it's not ready yet and it would be hard to make it ready because it's microscopic right because that's evidence from the reading "
15277,120.4,Jazmin,,"um student let's talk about your answer a little bit ","and see what i said was asking i say yes that is valuable because astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water "
15279,420.2,Farrah,,"yeah I think that's a really good answer, I think you could go a little bit further by just maybe quoting the text, just so that you really getting your information from the text Okay, yes Farrah. ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for for working with us and like in particular i just really wanted to thank you for "
15282,150.1,,,"so i know that we just read the article water on the moon and you class were supposed to answer a question right ","yeah we we all answered it and um we told you our answers and then um you said you'd give us some feedback on our answers "
15285,120.4,Luis,,"student can you remind me of your answer ","sorry to interrupt i'm sorry but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15287,220.1,Luis,,"well it's really good to have background knowledge on space student but i want to talk about how we answered the questions not so much the facts about the moon does that make sense ","um how we answer the questions okay okay yeah yeah okay "
15290,120.4,Farrah,,"alright so student can you remind me of your answer ","yeah i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15296,420.2,Farrah,,"is there a way that you can add some words to that that would strengthen your response and make it connect to the question a little more ","um well i picked an equipment and it's about water and i got it straight from the text so i know i did all the right things that in the question i'm in and so um and that's what it says in the story "
15302,420.2,Jazmin,,"you need a specific scientific tool called microsoft to look really closely right so if you just add that little sentence that helps give your answer some context so if i look at it without the question i still know what you're talking about right ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong because i when i read it it said to discover water on the moon and i know that the small machine nasa sent was looking for the water so that seems like that's the right answer "
15306,420.2,Jazmin,,"Right, so NASA did send a small machine, but can you add some details like what was that machine called. Do you remember ","yes i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is that that that would be "
15309,150.1,Jazmin,,"that is a way better answer do you see why it's a better answer ","i'm good because i added more words "
15311,150.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah "
15315,120.4,Chris,,"so student can you tell me what your response was ","yeah i bet the creators but but but something about the creators obey the partner from the printers food yeah "
15319,430.1,Chris,,"the question asked what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon right and you've told me where on the moon the water was discovered use more evidence from the text about the equipment to make your response stronger ","where the equipment the equipment well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks on masks and shoots "
15326,420.2,Chris,,"so is there information from that sentence that you can add to your response to just make it a little stronger ","nasa sent a small machine ice deposits and polar craters price oh okay they found craters for water when nasa sent a small machine "
15330,120.4,Oliver,,"okay student can you tell me ","same thing "
15332,110.1,Oliver,,"oh okay so you said that they needed a specific tool called the microscope ","yeah to look really closely "
15339,230.3,Oliver,,"to student earlier and gave her some suggestions ","on you saturate have to add more details to her thing so i'm all i'm more details i guess that's on your name assigned to a pool of water we should add the water you need to look really closely at the water "
15341,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah exactly ","okay okay i'm "
15343,110.1,Oliver,,"good ","i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to watch "
15346,110.1,All,,,"yeah yeah you i i really appreciate how you helped us all use evidence from the text to add more details to our our answers thanks so much i'm teacher thank you "
15350,120.4,Luis,,"so student can you remind me of your answer yes student ","i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
15353,120.4,Farrah,,"student let's start with you ","okay yeah so i said no not for a long time "
15358,230.1,Farrah,,"so what makes you think ","because at the end of the story it talks about how it's gonna be really expensive and take a lot of time and a lot of money and they probably won't be able to do it uh huh. "
15370,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah okay thank you student why don't we look at your response ","excuse me teacher i'm still confused okay so student needed like more information in hers but i put a lot of information in my answer and it's still needs work "
15380,120.4,Luis,,"all right student would you like your turn now ","yes i like my turn thank you "
15382,110.1,Luis,,"okay so you said water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen and what i like about ","i was gonna say i took it from the text "
15388,210.3,Luis,,"that how is that valuable so we can do that right we can split water water molecules into two parts hydrogen and oxygen but what does that do for us how is that valuable to the astronauts that are on the moon ","oh well you can drink well um we need oxygen to breathe so that's important "
15395,210.4,Luis,,"so let's go back into the text and try to find that specific line that you were referring to ","okay important resource Oh yeah that's where I found it okay okay astronauts could breathe oxygen okay. see i said that and oxygen hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel rocket fuel help spacecrafts to move just like gas helps cards to okay i could say all of that stuff i'd have to write all that down "
15399,420.2,Chris,,"oxygen is needed for astronauts to breathe and so if you added that to your response it would help me and any of your friends reading the response understand why the water on the moon is valuable to us ","okay there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
15408,420.2,Oliver,,"yes please restate the question in your response ","i'm sorry teacher i was looking at five o'clock and i can see that it's time for us to go to lunch i want to say thank you for how you like made class feel valued and you kind of explained when you explain what they needed to work on it give me ideas on how i can improve my answer "
15410,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
15416,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15418,150.1,Luis,,"yes i see that you know a lot about space but we're also going to further what we're going to know about space and use our knowledge about space to figure out more on the water on the moon ","okay "
15422,210.4,Luis,,"take a look at the second paragraph of the article what machine did nasa said that they use to discover the water ","nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate this machine it's a lunar orbiter "
15428,210.4,Luis,,"look at the third paragraph ","that means that the moon is drier than the driest desert on the earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you can't see it if you're looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look real close the microscope i think maybe "
15432,210.4,Jazmin,,"student you said that they use a small machine so great job recalling that they sent the small machine to discover the water on the moon do you remember what the name of the machine was called ","i don't remember "
15436,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you remember what the name of the machine was called let's look at the passage and see just like with student let's look at the second paragraph ","nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter to investigate oh the name of it is the lunar orbiter "
15441,210.4,Jazmin,,"what was the other equipment they use to see the water let's look at the third paragraph ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
15449,150.1,Jazmin,,"Everyone takes their own pace. ","i just read it student if you are listening you need a oh the miscroscope yeah the microscope "
15453,110.1,Chris,,"student let's start with you so you said scientists found craters are full of water on the moon right ","uh huh "
15455,110.2,Chris,,"Great job remembering that they found the water on the moon. ","um well student just said the lunar orbiter and the microscope and you told her that was right so i'm figuring that's the right answer "
15457,230.2,Chris,,"yes so can you show me where in the text she found those answers ","i feel like you said section two and section three "
15460,230.2,Chris,,"can you read me the sentence of one of them ","okay yeah it's the first sentence in section two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15463,110.1,Oliver,,"now student you said that you circled the same thing as student right ","uh huh "
15465,110.1,Oliver,,"so student said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely right ","yeah i circled that same thing "
15469,230.1,Oliver,,"you wrote the same thing what did you why did you circle those things ","because well um i was looking for where it said water and that was paragraph three was talking about looking at the water and then i was looking for equipment and i saw it said microscope and microscope is equipment "
15474,210.4,Oliver,,"the text said they found the water and used the microscope to use to see the water because it was so tiny but what did they do to find it ","well it's the same thing that student said right the lunar orbiter "
15477,230.2,Chris,,"the lunar orbiter great can you read me that sentence where you can find that ","um yeah let me see you know ms teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too lots of equipment "
15480,110.1,Oliver,,"let's have student the chance to answer his question okay ","yeah it's it's in the first sentence where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15483,210.4,Farrah,,"what did the text mention about another machine other than the microscope ","yeah because class said it "
15488,230.2,Farrah,,"perfect and do you remember where we found that ","yeah um cuz uh student and student read it too it was the first sentence of the second paragraph i was listening "
15490,110.1,Oliver,,"great i'm glad you were listening student you did a great job ","ms teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch you know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped us look for the evidence in the text to add to our answers "
15492,110.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
15495,110.1,Luis,,,"yes so i have like already know like all about space so i don't really think i even need to be in this class "
15497,120.4,Luis,,"well why don't we take a look at your answers really quick and see what we see what you wrote alright sounds like a plan ","yeah i can do that "
15505,410.3,Luis,,"So did you have questions about the passage? ","yeah i was just more thinking like these are things that i know because i really love space and my dad is an astronaut and so i was thinking like even like if it's not in the reading then i think the readings leaving it out you know So I should make sure that I'm like I'm using something from from the reading, rather than- "
15507,410.3,Luis,,,"okay "
15510,150.1,Farrah,,"awesome does class else have any questions about their responses ","um so for me basically um i guess my question was i don't really understand like right now why my answer is "
15512,150.1,Farrah,,,"yeah sorry i guess i just don't understand right now like why my answer is wrong "
15518,110.3,Farrah,,"but i think student by you being here you can use your friends and your classmates can use you as a resource if they have questions in the future about the readings or assignments that we're doing because it seems like you really understand understand this assignment ","that's great thank you "
15520,110.3,Jazmin,,,"well i was just going to kind of say the same thing because like what what i said was nasa sent a small machine and i was just wondering like why my answer was wrong "
15527,420.2,Jazmin,,"or different things like that just oliverelop your thought process a little bit more than you already then you already have but there's nothing wrong with your answer ","i can't tell what would a better answer sound like Ohhh, okay. That makes sense. "
15530,150.1,Chris,,"yeah student or student do you have questions ","well i guess the thing that i was thinking was kind of what student was saying before i still have a question about it because i went to nasa with my dad and i know that scientists like lots of equipment like you know like oxygen tanks masks and stuff like that and like it just like you know what i mean like that seems really important "
15536,420.2,Chris,,"and we want to make sure we're going to we want to make sure that we're using the text to support our answers ","Oh "
15538,410.1,Chris,,"because we were asking about equipment not what they found ","okay that that actually makes that makes a lot of sense thank you "
15542,150.1,Oliver,,"yeah of course and student do you have a question ","well basically i wrote the same thing as student so i guess i was wondering like so is the answer to the question that like that both the lunar orbiter and the microscope are used or is it like one of that is the right answer "
15546,110.2,Luis,,"but the lunar orbiter one second student the lunar orbiter and the microscope are both pieces of equipment that are used so that the both of those answers would be correct it's not one is right and one is wrong ","um yeah so i'm so sorry to interrupt but unfortunately we have to go to lunch "
15550,110.2,Luis,,,"i just wanted to tell you that i really enjoyed working with you and like in particular there were like some things in the class that were so cool like you really helped us to make sure that we were drawing like from the reading when we were answering questions and like also like it was really important like when you were asking like you know when you are helping student like understand like how to approach the question like that was really clear and it was really easy for us to understand what you are asking but thank you so much "
15554,110.2,Luis,,,"excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15562,120.4,Farrah,,"alright so um student do you want to share the answer that you got for the first question yeah sure okay ","i said um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15567,150.1,Farrah,,"does that makes sense ","oh yeah i guess you're saying that i was wrong "
15570,110.2,Farrah,,"no you weren't wrong i just think you were not wrong you did make a very clear point and the you stated that the scientists they use microscopes to look closely ","okay "
15573,120.4,Oliver,,"okay um how about student what did what was your answer ","i have that same answer us student i still don't understand why my answers wrong "
15581,410.3,Oliver,,"and so being able to write your own answer is beneficial as well, instead of the same as Farrah in this case. ","i mean i understood it was just that student went first so she said her answer and mine was the same i found the same answer in the story yeah i understood it "
15584,130.1,Oliver,,"and give you the same note that i gave student although the answer is correct i think that you could build a deeper meaning and build build upon your answer to oliverelop it even more and make it even stronger than it already is ","oh ok ok i guess i mean what i like i read the whole thing and i looked for all the keywords and i found i found that sentence with the keywords in it "
15588,130.1,Chris,,"your answer is correct i just when i'm looking at the answers i know that there are more parts that you can add to the answer and to make it a stronger answer doesn't it doesn't mean that it's right or wrong it just can be stronger ","um i was looking at the question again and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
15596,110.2,Chris,,"they have the oxygen tanks because they need to be able to breathe ","i mean some of it came from a story and some of it came from when me and my dad were looking at you know the pictures and the stuff that the astronauts used when they used to go on their space missions so yeah "
15602,150.1,Chris,,"Does that make sense to you. ","yeah yeah it did okay i bought my answer i did all pull some information from the text "
15604,120.4,Oliver,,"yeah you yep do you want to share with you wrote ","i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll have to see you later "
15606,120.4,Jazmin,,,"okay bye "
15610,120.4,Luis,,"i think we're just so we're just going to pick up right where we left off last time we met so student why don't you go ahead and share the answer that you had ","okay no i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
15613,120.4,Jazmin,,"oh okay thank you alright student why don't you go ahead and read your answer ","okay so i said nasa send a small machine "
15618,210.4,Jazmin,,"In the reading it did state clearly what kind of tool um or excuse me what the name of the small machine is Do you remember the name of the small machine. ","remember the name of it no "
15621,130.3,Jazmin,,"that's okay so in the reading it referenced i'm the small machine it's called a moon lunar orbiter to investigate ","yeah okay i see that right there it's right in the same sentence "
15626,150.1,Jazmin,,"Does that make sense, do you have any questions. ","still kind of confused "
15631,230.1,Jazmin,,"what do you know so why don't you what are you confused about why don't you share so we can try to figure it out and work through it ","okay so when you said i have to just save the name of the machine so that part i understood but then you were saying that i should add add more to my sentence so that has more power "
15635,150.1,Jazmin,,"okay does that make more sense ","i have to write more words "
15638,120.4,Luis,,"awesome um student what about you do you want to share your answer ","yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
15647,420.2,Chris,,"your answers aren't necessarily wrong, but I feel as though that when we go back and that when we do the assignment again you'll have you will know, know for next time that you can sit there, and you can add more. ","I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024. "
15651,110.3,Farrah,,"that's a really really cool that's really interesting i wonder if it will happen maybe it won't ","yeah okay i only do what you were saying about jazmin's answer because she didn't say the name of the machine but i wrote a complete sentence and i pulled mine from the text "
15657,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah yeah that does make sense okay "
15661,150.1,Chris,,"does class else have any other questions ","okay this one isn't a question but now i'm just all thinking about my answer cuz mine came from the story too is it the same as savannas "
15670,230.3,Oliver,,"so you have written that scientists found craters full of water on the moon ","yeah it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for explaining what each of us needed to work on because it gave me some ideas i think on how to improve my answer to "
15673,230.3,Jazmin,,,"thanks bye "
15677,150.1,Luis,,"so we just finished reading our texts water on the moon ","um it's more of a comment i have already kind of know all there is to know about space i don't know like i think i really have to be in this class "
15680,110.3,Luis,,"and you could help us to understand better ","yeah "
15685,210.4,Farrah,,"so if scientists are using a tool called a microscope what does that tell us about this stuff on the moon that they're looking at ","it tells us that it tells us that it's really small like whatever it is because it says it's microscopic Really small. "
15687,130.2,Oliver,,"really smaller exactly did class else think that while they're reading or see that in the text student ","yeah i am i thought that i thought the same thing i student so i i was thinking the same thing that that the microscope was the tool because you had to use it to see the the water "
15691,210.4,Luis,,"student have you used a microscope before what else do you think scientists use microscopes to look at it doesn't have to be on the moon you can think about things maybe you've used a microscope ","oh yeah no i totally we've done that before and science like we've looked at like the plant like cells and stuff like that so yeah i've seen lots of stuff with microscopes "
15694,210.4,Chris,,,"up i was just i was gonna say i used microscopes like you know what i mean like i used to science and up my mom is doctor and she like she uses microscopes at work "
15697,210.4,Farrah,,"can you think of other jobs where people use microscopes ","it's because we weren't going to work with you because our answers weren't right like i was wondering like why my answer was wrong "
15700,230.2,Farrah,,"yeah so you mentioned that the scientists looked use your tool called microscopes i was wondering if you could use some text evidence that proves to where you saw that in the text is there a quote that you remember ","totally there's a paragraph that's what i was saying the water is microscopic he wouldn't be able to see it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close to you have to like they couldn't find it unless you saw it right or did they find it another way "
15706,230.2,Jazmin,,"So, Jazmin. Do you have text evidence from your response. You said NASA send a small machine. Do you read about that. ","in the in the second paragraph it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
15710,110.4,Chris,,"nice ","i guess i was just thinking i've been to nasa with my dad and we looked around and i noticed that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and stuff like that so i was wondering like where does that fit in "
15714,110.2,Chris,,"so you can think of a way that they use oxygen tanks to find water they might need oxygen tanks to be on the moon ","yeah well they had to like you had to use the suits to get off the spaceship and go walk around and look for water "
15721,110.2,Chris,,"exactly exactly ","and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but i just really wanted to work with us today and like a particular i wanted to thank you for reminding us to use evidence from there because you don't always remember that and you really helped us tremendously and also like it was really cool like seeing student was an upcoming show because you were like asking him for his background knowledge and also like he was able to talk about like stuff which i think is really like i think that really works for him yeah today was fun "
15723,110.2,Jazmin,,,"thank you so much "
15725,110.2,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just was gonna say like i already know like all kinds of stuff about space and like basically i like i don't really think i even need to be in this class like i don't need any help "
15728,150.1,Luis,,"does that make sense student ","okay i can do that yeah "
15733,230.2,Farrah,,"so student you said that you'd need a scientific tool called the microscope and you also said that you circle the same thing now where in the text can you point that out just so that everyone's on the same page ","okay so let's basically i think let's see so you to paragraph three and we were saying okay the water they found is microscopic we wouldn't be able to see he were looking straight at it you need a microscope to look really close so like i guess that's that seems like really important to me you know like that that you can't i think you can't find the water unless you can see it well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong "
15736,110.2,Farrah,,"no your answer isn't wrong ","okay "
15738,110.2,Farrah,,"there was nothing wrong with your answer i like there i like both of your answers i just wanted class to be on the same page ","sounds good "
15741,410.2,Chris,,"and then student your response says that they found craters full of water but you didn't really answer the question of what equipment they use to find the craters ","oh like oh i see so okay that's actually that's really helpful so like i didn't say like what equipment i just was talking about craters so i'm not sure what i mean here's the thing when i know that because my dad took me to nasa but there's like you know what i mean like i saw that scientists use oxygen tanks and masks and spacesuits kind of like what we're saying and so i guess i'm wondering like that's not in the reading "
15745,230.1,Chris,,"well there is always textual evidence but it's good to bring back our knowledge as well that could help you bring the text to life so you and student kind of have similar responses so can you elaborate more on like background knowledge that you have also oxygen tanks and spacesuits things like that ","like you have to use equipment if you're going into space and i guess i guess the yeah yeah i mean i know a lot about like use like rocket fuel and you have use stuff like that you know what i mean Yeah. Yeah, exactly. "
15751,210.4,Jazmin,,"and what did the machine do what is used for ","you mean the lunar orbiter it's how they discovered the water "
15755,110.1,Farrah,,"you happen to know what the lunar orbiter is i feel like you have a little bit of surface up ","um so unfortunately we have to go to lunch like i wanted to make sure to thank you and in particular i wanted to thank you for helping us to try to clarify answers and you know asking us to make sure to use the text when we were responding to your questions to that we had added to thank you so much for working with us was really fun thank you bye bye "
15762,230.2,Luis,,"i'd like to focus first on those that said that they do that there is sufficient evidence so that would be student student student now what part of the text makes you think that the water would be a valuable resource ","yeah actually i think i got this all figured out i'm all good "
15765,230.1,Luis,,"what makes you think you got all figured out ","okay because you know i mean i already know that they found water on the moon i already know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff so i'm good "
15767,230.1,Luis,,"so is this from prior knowledge that you like read or seen the show or is it that you you like you have a really good understanding of the text ","well i mean i i read a lot of stuff about space and i watch nova on pbs so yeah like i have a lot of prior knowledge about this already "
15776,230.1,Luis,,"what made you say that ","okay okay that part i did see somewhere in this store in paragraph five it's like the second sentence can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
15782,120.2,Jazmin,,"i just wanted to clarify what the question was so it says that is there convincing evidence that water in the on the moon could be valuable now your answer yes student ","i'm still confused "
15786,230.1,Jazmin,,"what are you confused about ","well because what student got his answer in the text is different from where i got my answer in the text "
15791,150.1,Luis,,"does that make sense ","oh yeah yeah yeah okay yeah "
15797,150.1,Luis,,"give a different answer ","i gotta say if if i think it's a valuable or not i think "
15803,410.2,Luis,,"water splits into this and it wouldn't be a good resource or yes because it does split this and that and if you do read on it's leaning more towards the positive so i assumed that you were agreeing but i don't want to have to assume ","okay i guess i'm not sure if i agree or not okay "
15806,120.1,Chris,,"okay how about you read the text and then i'll come back to you later to see if your answer has changed ","okay okay well i was just reading i read that there could be a piece by by 2024 "
15808,110.1,Chris,,"by 2024 wow that is very interesting we never had a base on the moon ever ","yeah that could be pretty cool "
15823,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay and student you were saying that you found your evidence somewhere else in the text where did you find your evidence ","okay well i mean it's not like exactly somewhere else in the text i guess it's still from that same paragraph now let me try to remember where i found it oh no yeah it was okay it was it was in the one above that because i i pulled it from paragraph four where it says tfor example future astronauts could drink this water so i guess i don't know if student was right or if i was right as we get to different as we got it to different parts of the text "
15828,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah it does so so then i my answer is right i just wait actually what was wrong with my answer because you you said that i did good because i answered the question and i said yes "
15839,420.2,Oliver,,"a suggestion i would say is adding i know this because in paragraph four it states ","okay okay yeah that's actually helpful for me to teacher i love looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i really appreciate how you took the time to explain all of their ideas and and and and then kind of make i feel like class thought to feel valued and their ideas and and i also have some ideas from you explaining what what we need to work on to get answers "
15842,420.2,Oliver,,,"okay okay thanks teacher bye "
15844,420.2,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher "
15846,420.2,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15849,150.1,Luis,,"well we're just going to go through your class answers today just to make sure that we can have a full understanding in the broad spectrum of it i think you all have a pretty good understanding but i want to make sure you know fully what's going on ","ok oh ok "
15851,150.1,Luis,,,"you want to hear you want me to tell you what i said again "
15853,150.1,Luis,,,"ok no problem so i said let me see what i wrote down oh scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
15855,210.2,Luis,,"so they do use oxygen tanks but for this we're wondering what they're using for the water you know so we're wondering instead of just in a general sense what they use we're thinking what are they using for the water ","ok instead of a general sense what are they using for the water ok ok i mean they need the oxygen tank to breathe on the moon "
15857,210.4,Luis,,"they do but what are we using to get the water and to see what's going on ","oh i don't know yeah i don't know "
15860,230.3,Farrah,,"so does class want to actually ok oh jesus sorry one second class ok so student for example you said that they used a microscope to look really closely right ","uh-huh yeah "
15862,230.3,Farrah,,,"yeah "
15864,230.2,Farrah,,"student where did you find this how did you know did you find it in the text ","yeah in paragraph 3 it was the last sentence of the text that i found it "
15867,120.4,Oliver,,"so can you give me something different ","well i mean it was this i think that's the right answer though because it talked about the equipment and what it does and it's looking at the water so i don't think there is another answer "
15869,130.1,Jazmin,,"well there is a couple of answers ","yeah i think my answer is right so i don't know why my answer is wrong "
15871,420.2,Jazmin,,"but can you tell me what the machine is can you be a little bit more specific about that ","oh yeah nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter lunar orbiter "
15873,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah that's perfect so when we're saying our answers we want to be as specific as possible to the text because that's really important to give evidence to what we have instead of just the general so if you have a specific thing from the text definitely include that always in your response because that gives me an idea of how much you can understand what's going on ","ok "
15876,110.1,,,"so your answer was really really really great and i really enjoyed it ","oh thank you laughter "
15881,210.2,Chris,,"but something that they used in order to find it is the question that we're asking. ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen masks and tanks and suits "
15883,110.3,Chris,,"yeah i mean that's great that's great that you have that background knowledge i really appreciate you adding that to the conversation i think that's really really important ","ok yeah "
15887,210.4,Chris,,"do you know why they use a microscope from the text ","well when she read it it said to look at it really closely No. No, I don't know. "
15891,420.2,Chris,,"so when we're looking at our answers i want you to be able to maybe explain just why they needed this equipment as well ","Yeah. I got to explain more. I got to see more. "
15893,150.1,Chris,,"it's not always more but i want you to be able to see where the evidence is coming from because then i know that you know where the evidence is coming from ","ok ok yeah "
15895,150.1,Chris,,"reading the text is very important ","ok i think i got it "
15898,110.1,Oliver,,"that's perfect ","ok excuse me ms mccarthy "
15900,110.1,Oliver,,,"i was looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i know this was really short and we just met but i really appreciate how you helped me think of how i can use evidence from the text in making my own answer even if it's the same as somebody else's but to put it in my own words "
15902,110.1,Oliver,,,"thank you bye "
15906,110.1,Luis,,,"yes yeah so i just was gonna say that like i already own like all that there is about space so i don't think i even need to be in this class "
15908,220.1,Luis,,"so we're going to be focusing on just this text so that we can digest this and answer the question so even if you do know a little bit you can bring in that background information but we're gonna be focusing on the text that we read ","okay i can i can do that "
15912,120.2,Farrah,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover ","i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15914,230.2,Farrah,,"yeah they do use that that is a really good point and do you know when we answer these i want you class to try and think of where you found them and let me know where you found them because we want to bring in that information from the text so where do you think you found that one ","in the reading "
15918,230.2,Farrah,,"you can say the number of the point it was on so like the microscope part where was that ","oh it was paragraph three he said that the water they found was microscopic and that you'd need a scientific tool to look really close "
15923,310.1,Oliver,,"and i like that you really pulled that from the text ","um well i said pretty much the same thing as student um you know like i thought it was the microscope as well um so i guess i have the same answer "
15925,230.2,Oliver,,"is there anything more specific that you want to pull from her answer in the text ","i'm not sure what what to pull "
15928,120.1,Oliver,,"is there anything else that you want to add to that or is it just that ","um well i would say like scientists use the microscope to discover water "
15931,120.4,Chris,,"how about you student all right ","um yeah so i said that scientists found craters that were just full of water "
15933,120.1,Chris,,"and that's a really do you want to be a little bit more specific with your answer for me ","well i guess that they found lots of water like they found a whole bunch of water in these craters that was kind of you know what i mean "
15938,230.2,Chris,,"did you find that anywhere specifically in the text ","well they said they said oh okay they said this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
15941,120.4,Jazmin,,"how about you student ","so my answer with this it was nasa send a small machine but i was like why why is my answer wrong "
15943,420.2,Jazmin,,"so when we answer we want to be very specific so like in the text what small machine are they talking about did they say what kind of small machine ","yeah they they said in paragraph two nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
15948,420.2,Farrah,,"yep so that's what you want to specify that the equipment that use was the lunar orbiter which is a small machine so you are correct but we just want to make sure we're super specific about it ","did they use the orbiter or did they use the microscope i mean i guess i'm not sure why my answers wrong "
15950,210.4,Farrah,,"So they had to use the microscope to look really really closely out that so they use them both. ","interesting okay "
15954,210.4,Chris,,,"oh i just was saying that that scientists like well i've been to nasa so i know that scientists like oxygen tanks and masks and stuff so i was wondering "
15957,210.4,Chris,,,"oh sorry i was so if i know that's part of it but it wasn't in the reading how what what you know what i mean "
15962,110.2,Chris,,"yeah so you are correct ","Cool. And that's, that's like different from like if i talk about something that you know this was what i thought but this is my like i said like this is where i got the information "
15964,110.2,Chris,,"mm hmm and that's a very good way to do it that's cool mm hmm ","we actually have to go to lunch "
15968,110.2,Chris,,,"and i really want to thank you for making sure that check the reading mostly and then for me like i was really interested in like being able to think about how i was how i was like raising what i was saying is it got me thinking like how do i think about what i'm saying so that was really cool i felt like this interesting connection to my thoughts thank you so much "
15973,220.1,Luis,,"so i'm very impressed with all of your answers to the questions that we just went over and so what i want to do now is to go over these responses and help you adjust them just to make sure that we get our complete understanding of what we're saying yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
15977,120.4,Farrah,,"okay all right so student i'm gonna start with you so in remind me of what your answer was ","yeah sure i said i'm that you'd need let me look i think i say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
15981,230.2,Farrah,,"so good so in the text where did you find that in the text what made you choose as your response ","three well i was looking for equipment and then in paragraph three they they use the word scientific tool and i know that's the same thing as equipment and then i was looking for the other keywords about finding water on the moon and i saw that in paragraph three "
15991,120.4,Oliver,,"okay okay all right and how about you remind me of your answer now ","okay well i i had a circle the same thing i student because mine came from the third paragraph to it says um you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely if the last sentence in that paragraph "
15993,230.3,Oliver,,"nice so are you also having the same ideas student where equipment and scientific tools can be used interchangeably as a synonym ","yeah because i i know that a tool is something that you used to do with thing and i know equipment is something that you used to do a thing to "
15998,130.2,Jazmin,,"all right so student and deb why don't you class work together while i finish up with class else and you class can turn and talk quietly and find some more things that we can find for evidence yes student ","i don't understand i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16000,120.4,Jazmin,,"so remind me of your answer one more time ","i said nasa sent a small machine "
16002,230.1,Jazmin,,"so in your answer why did you choose that ","i guess similarly to what it is that i was looking for something that was like equipment and and i was also looking for where they would like discover the water and so that was a piece of equipment "
16011,420.2,Jazmin,,"make sure you use evidence from the text to support that scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ","okay i have to write that from the beginning because i was just adding on to my old answer to i found a lunar orbiter "
16013,420.2,Jazmin,,"scientist sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter is what it states so you want to word that and make sure that the understanding of where it came from and what it is is incorporated into your answer ","okay okay where it came from it came from nasa right "
16015,110.1,Jazmin,,"yep ","and what it is is a small machine called an orbiter "
16018,110.1,Chris,,"okay good job i guess i can write that down okay ","you know what i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
16021,120.4,Chris,,"they do do that so student was that your answer for the ","no my answer was about the polar craters "
16024,230.2,Chris,,"alright so we're in the text did you find that answer what made you choose that as the answer to the question ","okay i remember it was in the beginning um yeah and paragraph one and why i chose it was because i was looking for some of the keywords in the question discover water on the moon and in that in the third sentence or four sentence it has almost all those words in their scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the most polar crater so it had all the keywords "
16030,120.3,Chris,,"it did so i want you to read read me the question out loud ","what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon What equipment. well i guess i didn't i didn't use equipment but i do use discover water on the moon "
16035,310.1,Chris,,"yep so the discover water on the moon is definitely important and it definitely was found in that first paragraph and i understand where you would get that answer ","okay um they use the lunar orbiter to find water in the in the poor craters do i keep my craters or do i change the whole "
16037,210.2,Oliver,,"we just need to you know the equipment that they use to find the water in the craters okay ","excuse me "
16039,210.2,Oliver,,,"it's time for us to gold so we'll have to see you later "
16044,150.1,Luis,,"alright class so we were working on our responses ","i didn't ask me "
16047,120.4,Luis,,"alright student so i don't you remind me of what your answer was for the first question ","okay but i also just want to say i think i got all this figured out now i'm all good "
16050,120.4,Luis,,"all right can you just remind me of your answer ","yeah okay so i said i'm scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
16054,230.2,Luis,,"all right that is very true i want you to walk me through where you found that answer ","okay maybe i didn't find it in here but i know that i know that they can't go to the moon without oxygen tanks "
16058,230.2,Luis,,"in paragraph five did you find it ","oh yeah look in paragraph five refill the gas tanks before heading out into it oh no that's gas tanks i was thinking about the breathing part "
16060,230.2,Luis,,,"astronauts could breathe oxygen okay that's something "
16062,210.3,Luis,,"yeah so in the question the question says what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon do you think oxygen tanks to help them to discover the water ","well i mean it helps them breathe "
16064,210.3,Luis,,,"look for water if you can't breathe "
16069,120.4,Farrah,,"what did you say student ","the lunar orbiter but i said the microscope and the teacher said that was right "
16074,230.1,Luis,,"it's the microscope and the lunar orbiter so i want you to tell me why you chose those ones now what made you change your thinking ","because because that's what i'm student had and what student had and you you told them that was correct "
16079,150.1,Luis,,"Okay, so that we can make sure we are understanding. ","okay all right paragraph two it says lunar orbit our land at the south pole and okay so that's looking well i mean that's not actually water nice but ok so that's one thing for microscope they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close well actually that's looking at the water that's not looking for the water so i actually think student is wrong and i think jazmin's answers right "
16083,210.4,Luis,,"the text says they needed the microscope to find the water because they had to look very closely at it and they needed the lunar orbiter to find the water ","oh yeah yeah yeah okay i get that "
16086,150.1,Jazmin,,"all right does class have any questions about their responses and how they can help to make them better ","i'm still kind of confused okay so i was trying to look at the sentence that you helped me to write "
16089,150.1,Jazmin,,,"i'm not sure like how to i mean i know i so i read nasa's into small machine and then you're like that's so vague right that the name so i then i wrote now this is meant to solve machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and then there was more more that you you you suggested that i write but i don't i don't remember how to make what to add to my answer "
16093,420.2,Jazmin,,"so one thing you can do to add to your answer is in the text where did you find that answer so you can say in paragraph two ","ok ok ok ok i got it "
16103,150.1,Chris,,"that makes sense ","yeah mine's more a comment than a question because what i let me think oh yeah oh cuz we were talking about the water on the moon and i was thinking about how i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
16105,230.1,Chris,,"really so do you think they could use the lunar orbiter or the microscopes to bother there and find it the water yeah yeah ","i'm wondering if maybe they would just leave some stuff there so that they can keep building up a whole piece there and then they can leave their their tools and equipment on the moon "
16109,150.1,Oliver,,"that's a very interesting question does class else have any questions or comments related to the question about what we were reading ","a small question on course as sure my answer sound the same as jazmin's answer "
16113,420.2,Oliver,,"so all of you in your responses can add where you found your answers in the text into your response so we can all say like in this paragraph i found my answer ","ok ok i understand i got that well thanks so much teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i didn't want to say yeah thank you for helping us to realize what was missing from our answers because now i do know that i should write on like where i found the information and maybe one more sentence from a text "
16117,150.1,Farrah,,"hello class i know when we are working on our tasks in discussions with water on the moon and i know we are gonna dive into what we read ","i think student has the first question "
16119,110.3,Luis,,"think it's good so you can share your answers with the rest of the class because maybe someone might not know as well as you do ","cool yeah yeah i can do that "
16121,110.3,Oliver,,,"um yeah but i think some and i was going to share her answer "
16123,110.3,Farrah,,,"that's okay we can share answers it would you like us to each share answers one by one "
16125,110.3,Oliver,,,"i'm pretty much the same hey "
16129,120.4,Oliver,,"no problem so let's all share what we had for our responses who would like to start ","i'll start so i said that in terms of what it meant it scientists us to discover water i said you need a scientific tool microscope to look really close yeah and i have the same answer as um i had the same answer as seven basically i circled the same thing "
16133,120.4,Luis,,,"for me i said scientists found craters of water i was thinking that there's like lots of fun for me i was saying that basically nasa send a small machine yeah and what i was saying is basically that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that you know "
16139,210.4,Oliver,,"so can someone tell me what is what sticks out within that sentence ","i'm like it sticks out that it says the sun never shines there it's always in dark "
16141,110.1,Farrah,,"it's a dark dark place student do you want to share too ","basically i had to think "
16143,110.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah i will be in any in any case but i was also wondering like i know we're looking at the and i hate to interrupt but i was just thinking like i don't really know why my answer is wrong "
16151,210.4,Jazmin,,"can someone tell me what sticks out to them in that sentence ","so i think like one thing it says is that the lunar orbiter is what lands and looks like i think that's really important like is the thing that looks for the ice deposit and then also well that was the big thing i saw "
16153,110.1,Chris,,"very good response ","i kind of was thinking about what student and student were saying and i was thinking that the deposits are small so maybe like it's you know what i mean like maybe you need a microscope to see "
16156,110.1,Oliver,,"good you need tools to see them ","um yeah pretty much like student i think said for me and student "
16161,120.3,Chris,,"the water they found is microscopic mean you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","um yeah so i think like for me that's interesting is it says like to see the water you have to use a microphone "
16163,110.1,Chris,,"yes absolutely ","it makes me think i guess my question is like i've been to nasa with my dad and we saw that like there was like masks and suits and stuff that astronauts or i was wondering like why that's not in the reading "
16165,110.1,Chris,,,"yeah sorry i i was just wondering why like the suits and oxygen and stuff like that like wasn't like that seemed like that would be in court you know what i mean but it's not mentioned anywhere "
16174,110.3,Farrah,,"i mean obviously you need oxygen to survive so that's a very good observation ","yeah so i was thinking that it's super dry and if it's super dry like it says that it's like spread over a water area like that the water doesn't just like you know what i mean it's not just in a pool and it would be really hard to see and unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to take a second and really thank you for working with us in particular you really like i think made class feel like they were their opinions and like yeah i think class i think also like what was so important is like you really helped us to make sure that we looked at the end to like figure out like what we were supposed to be me and you also you know you really had us listen to each other and that was really cool because sometimes we don't like listen to each other's ideas and conversations and today i was listening so close so thank you so much for for helping us "
16178,110.3,Luis,,,"excuse me but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16180,150.1,Luis,,"oh student you know plenty about space but i just want to talk about what we learned in the text and what kind of interested us ","oh oh ok "
16184,150.1,Chris,,"do you understand what i mean ","yeah yeah because i went to nasa with my dad so i do know about the mars rover and other things too "
16186,110.3,Chris,,"that's awesome space is so cool and i'm so glad that it's a passion of yours ","yeah "
16191,310.1,Jazmin,,"student your response was really awesome i love that you had a really specific reference to the text talking about nasa and that they sent a small machine ","but i don't understand why my answer is wrong OK, OK, so I guess I don't know how to do that. "
16195,110.1,Jazmin,,"all right so you said that nasa sent a small machine to the moon ","uh-huh So NASA sent a lunar orbiter? "
16197,110.4,Jazmin,,"yeah nasa sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon ","ok so that's what i should say nasa sent a lunar orbiter to investigate the moon "
16200,420.3,Oliver,,"you want to make sure that when you're reading a text you're trying to take in as many details that are specific to the question as possible ","I do. I do. And I do want to say I only said that I circled the same as Farrah so I wasn't going to say the exact same thing, but I didn't like, circle it because she circled it. I just happened to have the same answer as her. "
16204,420.2,Oliver,,"i want you to try to when you're answering questions about text i want you to try to look for specific things and even if you share the same ideas as your classmate try to articulate it in a new way and try to explain your thinking ","ok ok explain my thinking ok "
16206,150.1,Oliver,,"you understand ","so you're saying if student has the same answer as me then i should try to find a different answer "
16208,420.2,Oliver,,"not necessarily for example if student has the answer then you can say the same answer but just work to kind of say it in your own words and describe what you thought about it ","ok ok yeah my english teacher says that to say it in your own words i could do that "
16211,230.2,Farrah,,"but we just want to work to kind of find an example in the text so that you know where you saw that in the text ","yeah it was in paragraph three "
16214,110.2,Chris,,"all right awesome i really liked how you said the specifics about the microscope and you said like you explained that they used the microscope to see water on earth that was really wonderful ","it's not so much a question but remember how i was telling you about how i went to nasa with my dad so yeah i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
16216,110.3,Luis,,"they do they use all of that that's really great so that's what we would call background knowledge that's stuff that you know before even reading the article and that's really awesome ","ok ok ok well it looks like it is time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say mr dallas thank you so much for explaining what each of us needs to specifically work on so now i know that i should explain my ideas or say them in my own words even if they're the same as what somebody else said and then i also heard you tell student what she should work on too so thank you very much "
16219,110.3,All,,,"bye "
16222,110.3,Luis,,,"um yeah so here's kind of my question so i was gonna say like um i kind of already know about space so i don't think i actually have to be in this class because i don't really need any help "
16224,150.1,Luis,,"um student i saw you class seen this class because i think that all your answers showed really good understanding of space but i think that we could just get a little bit closer a little bit more specific have an answer to the questions ","okay i guess i can stick our out "
16232,120.4,Farrah,,"so, can you guys raise your hand to someone to answer my question. what color is my sweater? ","okay so your sweatshirt is "
16251,210.2,Oliver,,"the important words in the question are the ones that helped create the question and then they connect to what you read so you want to look in the question and see what those important words are ","Okay, so. so i think i'm gonna go first okay yeah that's fine cuz you're on the left so that's cool okay so we're trying to break apart the question if i understand correctly and we're trying to figure out right like what are the important words in the question is that right i think so although actually i think we're supposed to answer the question and figure out what what the important words in the reading like you know what i mean like which were the important words we're supposed to look at so i think that's what i'm going to figure out because that's what i thought our answer was supposed to be i don't think that's quite right student but you know if you're going to do that i guess you're going to do that like what i think what i think is basically like okay so the important words in the question to be are effectively like equipment because it seems like that they want to find it and they want to like um i guess maybe scientists because we know that there and then water those are the most important parts of the question because they're saying that they're asking you what equipment do they use and then the the thing that they're finding is water and that's the most important thing of all so that's what i think i'm okay so are you done student yeah you can look at it okay so what i noticed in the actual paragraph was i thought that the words that were important were um let's see if i look at it like i think the main thing that was important was um lunar orbiter water craters ice and microscope those are the most important words in the read eight that i saw okay "
16262,120.4,Oliver,,"i'm student what where did your class choose as the most important word in the question ","so we had a disagreement and we kind of were thinking differently so i thought that you were asking what were the important words like in the question itself so when i was looking for important words what i said was like equipment scientists and water because that's what we're talking about right we're talking about finding water and we're talking about the equipment that the scientists use and how they were able to find water so that's important words student had something fferent um yeah so for me basically what i said was that i thought the most important words because i thought you were saying the most important words in the paragraph so i thought okay the most important words are water like lunar orbiter microscope oh like glass like the glass of water that they use and i and and like words like that because those are all words that that have to like that they're asking about you know what i mean "
16268,120.4,Chris,,"Chris Jazmin or Luis do you guys have an answer to share Chris. ","um so unfortunately we have to go to class but before we go i just wanted to thank you so much for working with us it was really fun to work with you thank you so much bye "
16272,120.4,Luis,,,"So I was just thinking, like, I think I got this all figured out, so I think good to go. "
16276,150.1,Luis,,"i'm student i think that you class all have it figured out but i think that if we just look at it a little more in depth we could just get our answers to that much better ","yeah we thought so student and i both thought that equipment was a really important word and that we thought that equipment was the most important for um and we thought that scientists was pretty important too because both of us were thinking about how much equipment like has to be you know what i mean so basically um student and i thought about a lot about it student didn't totally agree with us "
16288,210.3,Jazmin,,"would class like to raise their hand and share the word words that they circled ","um i'm still a little bit confused about part of it but i think that it started to make a little more sense as we went through this sort of exercise so here's what i am circle so i circled lunar orbiter and then yeah and i kind of circled microscope but i really thought you know orbiter was the only equipment that was used to find water like i guess you could say the microscope was used to study the water but um so i circled that one to like apple circle but you know what i mean like that's that's what i ended up with "
16293,310.1,Oliver,,"student that's a really great job because you look through the text and you found the equipment that's mentioned which is a lunar orbiter but you also notice that a microscope is mentioned but you realize that the microscope does not help them find water on the moon ","i'm so student and i kind of work together again as we we usually work kind of together and do the same stuff as we think fairly similar and so actually one thing that i was thinking is that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 and what it made me think is like it made it seem like all the equipment's even more important so like what i ended up circling i circled microscope i circled glass i circled lunar orbiter "
16296,410.3,Oliver,,"lunar orbiter is a really great piece of equipment that you mentioned however i also want to make sure that we know that glass is not so much equipment as it is just something that's mentioned as an object ","oh so they didn't use a glass to measure it "
16305,110.1,Chris,,"alright student and great job and are you class worked as a partner ","okay so i circled the same stuff like actually i circled microscope and lunar orbiter i didn't circle glass because what i thought when i read it was that glass was just like how much water like 32 ounces not that they actually you know use the glass but i added because i thought it was showing or i added a few words at the bottom like spacesuit and oxygen tanks just because i was still thinking that you'd have to use them to find the water so i just didn't want to forget that because it seems like that would be important "
16312,210.4,Farrah,,"a microscope helps them study the water and helps them look at it but the microscope itself did not go all the way up to the moon okay ","oh so they like okay so i think they're beginning to understand so like they used the lunar orbiter to find the water but like student and i were confused right student you know we were confused because we were thinking that you couldn't find it if you couldn't see it so we thought like maybe somebody had the microscope and walked around and they put it on the microscope kind of the dirt and they were like oh look it's a script but that's not that's not right they they studied it after they found it "
16322,310.1,Oliver,,"class it's a really great job i really love you class are starting to use the text that you read previously ","um unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you again for working with us and like in particular i really wanted to thank you for doing a couple things like one thing is that you really helped us to understand like what the words we were looking for in the question and you were really patient with us as we try to understand your instructions and you really encouraged us to clarify the thinking that we were using and you were like offering really really thoughtful concerns like when you told me what you are a little concerned about how how i was approaching this stuff and when you are concerned that we were all mentioning the microscope well not all of us i guess student was mentioned on student you really need but um basically like what really jumped out to me is like that um we had a really strong suggestions for like how to go forward and you really kind of like we're able to figure out how we were thinking about each problem and it really helped us to understand how to how to solve the so that was pretty cool thank you so much it was really fun to work with bye "
16327,150.1,Luis,,"and we are going to look at our answers to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16330,110.3,Luis,,"you know all about space student ","okay "
16336,230.1,Farrah,,"so let's student why do you think you need a microscope to look at the water on the moon ","um okay a couple of reasons one we've been using microscopes in science class and our teacher had us look at little water molecules water drops under the microscope so i know that they do that and then when i was reading the story in paragraph three is the last sentence it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
16340,230.1,Oliver,,"why did you circle the same as student ","well i was looking in the story for equipment and looking for water and in paragraph three they say the water they found is microscopic so that's the place where they found the water and then the name of the equipment and that one is the microscope "
16343,110.1,Chris,,"awesome ","i said that the scientist on crators full of water "
16347,210.2,Jazmin,,"so let's go back to our question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what is one important word in that question student ","i think equipment "
16349,110.1,Jazmin,,"equipment awesome you're right you're right ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16358,230.2,Luis,,"you think equipment like oxygen like an oxygen oxygen tank ","so actually i didn't even really read it because i already know a lot about space and i already know that scientists use oxygen tank so that's how i got that piece "
16361,150.1,Jazmin,,"so let's look deeper into that student ","i got my part in paragraph two i just didn't say the name of the machine but i had it "
16363,210.4,Jazmin,,"so student can you tell us the name of the machine from paragraph two ","i read it it's the lunar orbiter "
16365,210.3,Jazmin,,"the lunar orbiter so how can we incorporate that word lunar orbiter into our answers ","i could just say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
16369,210.3,Chris,,"student how could you incorporate the word lunar orbiter into your answer ","um i could say scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16375,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome ","um i guess i could say um well i don't see how i can use it because i thought that the equipment was the microscope "
16380,110.2,Oliver,,"it says your the microscope is right it is very much right ","well if the lunar orbiter is right how can the microscope be right too which one is right "
16382,130.2,Luis,,"well let's look who knows what a lunar student do you know what a lunar orbiter is ","um no actually okay i don't know that one i don't know what that one is "
16386,130.2,Chris,,"okay who can tell me what a lunar orbiter is ","um well when i was reading the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so the lunar orbiter it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater I didn't even realize that was that was the same thing, like a micro a lunar orbiter is a microscope. "
16389,210.3,Chris,,"where do we use a lunar orbiter ","on the moon "
16391,210.3,Chris,,"on the moon and where can we use a microscope ","anywhere "
16394,210.3,Chris,,"how would we make our answers a little bit more specific ","you know now i'm going to add that to my list of equipment because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16396,130.3,Oliver,,"right so now that we know a lunar orbiter is what we use to discover water on the moon how can we re re answer this question ","can i just say it like how you said a lunar orbiter was used to discover water on the moon "
16399,130.2,Farrah,,"student do you agree with that ","um yeah well now that i understand um yeah uh yeah i do "
16402,110.1,Chris,,"awesome ","i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
16404,110.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
16407,220.1,Chris,,"okay hi class so in our last lesson we learned that a lunar orbiter is what we can use to find water on the moon does class remember ","yeah "
16410,220.1,Luis,,"so let's talk a little bit more about what we can go ahead student ","yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but i got this all figured out now so i think i'm all good "
16414,120.4,Chris,,"the word starts with an e ","um equipment "
16417,120.4,Farrah,,"does class agree ","yeah "
16421,120.4,Jazmin,,"so can somebody look and try to see where a good evidence would be to add into our answer ","okay we already have the lunar already "
16423,110.4,Farrah,,"we already had the lunar orbiter part ","i think i already put evidence in my answer too "
16425,120.4,Farrah,,"what evidence do you think you put in your answer student ","okay well i put the lunar orbiter and then i added that to what i said about the microscope so then i have two names of equipment and i have looking really closely which is from the story and evidence is just from the story right "
16428,120.4,Chris,,"and we where does the water hide on the moon ","in the craters that one was in my answer "
16433,120.4,Chris,,"to support what we are trying to say ","okay well i okay so what about mine because i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16438,120.4,Jazmin,,"a lunar orbiter student kind of touched on that in her answer ","i'm still kind of confused "
16440,120.4,Jazmin,,"when you confused on student ","i guess i don't know which evidence i'm supposed to be looking for "
16442,120.2,Jazmin,,"so let's look all together we are trying to find why we use a lunar orbiter ","to find water on the moon "
16445,110.4,Farrah,,"again student kind of touched on it and her answer ","to look at the water on the moon "
16448,210.3,Chris,,"but also because the water is so small on the moon right ","yeah yeah it's microscopic "
16451,210.3,Oliver,,"so how can we add those into our answer ","okay um i'm gonna say okay so let me look at my my answer before okay um you'd need all scientific tool called a microscope and a lunar orbiter to look really closely because it's microscopic "
16455,210.3,Chris,,"student how can you change your answer ","okay scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter because the water well if the water was microscopic then how did they find the craters full of water "
16459,140.1,Chris,,"the water is hiding in the craters ","so they're full of water at the bottom no oh man now i'm confused scientists have known for a long time okay well scientists found craters full of water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
16461,140.1,Chris,,,"because the water was microscopic "
16464,210.3,Chris,,"all right let's go to student student how can you change your answer ","oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the water on the moon i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
16466,210.3,Chris,,,"a base like they might build a moon base "
16468,110.3,Chris,,"oh that's very cool student ","yeah yeah "
16470,140.1,Chris,,"maybe maybe we'll have to read about that next time ","oh yeah that'd be cool "
16473,210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah all right student how can you include those into your answer ","okay um okay teacher how did you know that we should include microscopic in the answer "
16477,120.1,Jazmin,,"what student ","how did you know that we should put the microscopic part in the answer remember when i was saying like i'm trying to figure out like how do i know what part of the story the evidence i should put in my answer "
16479,210.3,Jazmin,,"So in this answer we're talking specifically about the moon. So which one of those things do you would you think would be more specific? ","definitely the lunar orbiter "
16481,110.4,Jazmin,,"definitely the lunar orbit are so that's why we're including the lunar orbiter in our answer ","okay and then the microscopic word "
16483,130.3,Jazmin,,"we're using the microscopic part to prove that we need a lunar orbiter ","oh ok ok i understand okay "
16486,210.3,Jazmin,,"awesome so how can we change your answer a little bit student to include that evidence and then also include the little the lunar orbiter ","okay um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter because the water is microscopic "
16489,110.1,Luis,,"perfect ","oh i gotta do this too "
16494,110.1,Luis,,,"oh okay nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter because the water was microscopic "
16500,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome student ","um. well teacher i'm looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i am thinking about my answer and i think i learned that we have to be specific and put in evidence that tells why "
16503,110.1,Oliver,,,"oh wow that was right oh cool okay yeah well thanks teacher for telling us um what what evidence from the text we should put in our answer and and that we how to do that okay "
16505,110.1,Jazmin,,,"oh thanks teacher "
16507,230.1,Farrah,,"okay student we're going to start with you so you answered the question of what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon and your answer was that you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely how did you get to that answer ","reach every reader well i was looking at the at the text and i thought about the fact that the question asked about equipment and so i was looking for some things that was equipment and then the question also asked about water and so i saw in paragraph three that they were talking about finding the water and they were talking about the microscope which is equipment "
16510,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense do you see that ","oh yeah i see it "
16514,150.1,Luis,,"what about making is that making more sense to you ","oh i don't think i know i don't understand why i'm why it's not the microscope excuse me i'm sorry to interrupt but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16516,220.1,Luis,,"well student that's great that's you feel like you know everything that there is to know about space but there is always more that we can learn and maybe by listening to our friends answer is we can learn even more ","oh okay "
16518,220.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
16522,230.1,Oliver,,"okay so student i see that you just answered the same as student did you read the article ","yeah yeah i had the same answer that student did that they were asking about finding water and i'm paragraph three talks about finding water Okay. They use a microscope to see the water but not to discover the water "
16524,230.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16527,210.3,Jazmin,,"well your answer is not completely wrong you did say that nasa send a small machine but can you tell me what that small machine is ","oh okay oh she called a lunar orbiter "
16531,130.1,Chris,,"can you tell me what equipment they use so student and student you're not completely wrong a microscope is a piece of equipment but that's not the full answer ","ok ok so "
16533,120.1,Chris,,"student can you tell me what kind of equipment that they used to discover water on the moon ","you told student that she was close because she said on the small machine and then you asked her what it was called and she said the lunar orbiter so i think you told her that that was the answer right "
16535,130.1,Chris,,"right and then student and deb also let us know that they use a microscope as well once they discovered the water do you remember reading that ","yeah yeah i remember reading paragraph three but i didn't think that um that that was it because because they said that they were talking about finding the water and i had seen that there was like a lot of water in the craters "
16537,120.1,Chris,,"right it can be a little confusing if you don't read over it carefully huh ","yeah i guess so um but i do know like a lot i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16539,110.1,Luis,,"right and that's student that was your point right ","yeah yeah like i know a lot of a lot of equipment stuff "
16541,120.2,Luis,,"okay so student what can you tell us about the equipment that the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","um well well i had said that um i think they need to use like oxygen tanks in order to go to the moon you know when they have to wear their space shoot so and that's equipment tools because they can't breathe on the moon "
16543,110.3,Luis,,"right so you really are thinking outside of the box you're not just reading the article and just using what the article has given us you're thinking outside of the box and thinking about the other equipment that they might use yeah ","yeah cuz i mean i read a lot about space "
16545,140.1,Luis,,"so you like to read ","yeah "
16547,120.1,Luis,,"well that's well that's great so student what do you think about the equipment that the article has told us about ","um ah you mean nothing like that what you told student about "
16551,120.3,Luis,,"can you find it and that's in paragraph 2 ","not i sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large bore crater these ice deposits are very small okay yeah i yeah "
16555,210.4,Chris,,"so then in paragraph three what does it tell us that they use it that they needed to us to look at to see these very small deposits of water ","um the microscope "
16558,210.4,Chris,,"so the first piece of equipment that they're using is called what ","lunar orbiter "
16560,210.4,Farrah,,"and the second piece of equipment was called what ","the microscope "
16563,150.1,Farrah,,"the microscope good job student so does class understand ","i think so um you know what i just realized it's it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say thanks for for for taking like and having us keep looking back at the text and and and keep asking us the questions so that we can kind of keep thinking about it and thinking about it "
16565,150.1,Farrah,,,"okay bye "
16570,150.1,Luis,,,"i'm good yeah i'm good too me too i'm good i had one question i shouldn't be in this class because i already know everything i know all about space "
16572,150.1,Luis,,"student you are very smart but there you've got to remember there is always room for us to grow and improve and learn more ok ","ok "
16575,120.4,Chris,,"does class want to volunteer their answer ","i'll say mine "
16577,120.4,Chris,,,"i said that they found craters full of water "
16581,410.1,Chris,,"but the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover that so are craters full of water is that a type of equipment ","no craters aren't equipment so i guess no "
16583,410.1,Chris,,,"i said since craters aren't equipment then i guess no no it's not "
16586,130.1,Farrah,,"so that's good you thought through that it wasn't a bad answer it just wasn't correct for that question ","i could "
16588,130.1,Farrah,,,"i said the part in the story where it says that they found that they need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
16592,310.1,Jazmin,,"so a microscope is a type of equipment it's a piece of equipment that was mentioned in the article so that's great that you were able to point that out ","excuse me miss brown "
16594,310.1,Jazmin,,,"i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16596,120.4,Jazmin,,"what was your answer student ","that nasa sent a small machine "
16598,210.4,Jazmin,,"they did nasa did use a small machine can you tell me what that small machine was ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter "
16600,210.3,Jazmin,,"a lunar orbiter so the question of what type of equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what would be a good full answer student ","what type of equipment did scientists use to inaudible "
16603,110.4,Jazmin,,"they did so scientists used a lunar orbiter to discover the water on the moon ","i don't know "
16605,130.2,Chris,,"does class remember ","i answered craters full of water but you said craters wasn't equipment i know that they said there's a lot of water deep in the moon's craters so i would think a lot of water "
16607,210.4,Farrah,,"if you look at paragraph 3 it says the water they found is microscopic and that means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking right at it but student told us that the article says that in order to see the water we would need what student ","a microscope "
16609,210.4,Jazmin,,"so how many types of equipment were mentioned in our article ","the microscope and the lunar orbiter "
16612,130.3,Chris,,"right there were two so a good full answer to what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon would be scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and a microscope to be able to see the microscopic amounts of water yes student ","i just wanted to say that i went to nasa so i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits too "
16614,130.3,Chris,,"Our question said, what did they use to discover water? So oxygen tanks and their suits, that wouldn't be part of that answer. But they are pieces of equipment that astronauts absolutely would have to use. ","yeah ok "
16616,120.2,Oliver,,"so the second part of our discussion question is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","excuse me miss brown i'm sorry to interrupt "
16618,120.2,Oliver,,,"i just realized that it's time for us to go to lunch so i know this time was short but of i'll see you later ok "
16620,120.2,All,,,"bye "
16622,120.2,Luis,,"ok so we're going to discuss the next question and that is is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable does class have any thoughts on that ","i just wanted to remind you my dad's actually an astronaut "
16624,120.4,Luis,,"ok that's awesome student do you have any thoughts about the water on the moon do you think that it's a valuable is there convincing evidence that water on the moon is valuable based off of our article ","water is valuable we've got to drink it all the time so yeah based on the article i would say yeah water on the moon is valuable "
16627,210.4,Luis,,"and what does the article tell us about why water on the moon would be valuable ","yeah i do "
16629,130.2,,,"does class want to help student out why does the article tell us that water on the moon could be so valuable ","i had an idea but i don't remember "
16632,120.4,Chris,,"what's your idea student ","it was something about how it was talking about water can be broken down into two parts do you remember what that is hydrogen and oxygen "
16636,210.4,Chris,,"awesome yep so smart so why would it be helpful if it can be broken down into two parts what could those things what could oxygen and hydrogen be used for what do we use oxygen for ","to breathe I don't know what we use hydrogen for. "
16641,120.1,Jazmin,,"uh-huh oh you know what else ","what you can use water to grow things so that we can have a moon garden on the moon that would be really nice "
16646,110.1,Jazmin,,"that might be a good idea ","i have to look again water could be useful in lots of ways they could drink the water so is water so that's something they could drink the water "
16649,210.4,Jazmin,,"does the article tell us that water is light or is water heavy ","is says water is heavy "
16654,130.3,Oliver,,"so astronauts would be able to use the water if it was broken down for oxygen and hydrogen to fuel the rockets oxygen to breathe obviously the water to drink ","mumbling i just see them asking a question if we think it'd be a good thing "
16657,210.2,Oliver,,"but spending the money building the equipment and doing the research do you think that it would be worth it is the amount of water on the moon and the uses for the water on the moon valuable enough for nasa to spend the money and do the research ","we need to drink water and i feel like if the astronauts were on the moon and they get thirsty then they do want to be able to have some water to drink right "
16659,230.3,Oliver,,"right they would need water to drink so student you think that it would be worth it to spend the money and do the research ","yeah "
16661,130.2,Farrah,,"ok student what do you think ","i guess i don't know i don't know if i think nasa has a lot of money so i guess i figured they can spend a lot of money because they have a lot of money but i don't know if it's worth it "
16663,210.3,Farrah,,"you are probably right nasa does have a lot of money but if they do the research and they spend the money and then they don't get a lot of water then what do you think they would be upset ","oh yeah my mom gets really upset if she spends a lot of money on food and then my brother doesn't eat it she gets really mad "
16665,210.1,Farrah,,"right so they would feel like maybe they were wasting it so they have to have enough evidence to show that the amount of water that they could extract from the moon that the uses that they could use the water for on the moon that those uses and the amount of water that it would be worth it to them to spend the money and to build the equipment ","yeah i see what you're saying "
16667,150.1,Oliver,,"class else have a question ","it's not a question but i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch "
16669,150.1,Oliver,,,"but i did want to say even though we only had a short time together i appreciate how you asked each of us about what we were thinking and you took some time to explain like for student and ask her some questions that made her feel valuable and i feel like for student and student too so thank you so much for helping us think about what we were reading "
16671,150.1,All,,,"bye "
16675,150.1,Farrah,,,"hi good to see you "
16681,150.1,Farrah,,"yes water on the moon did you class enjoy the reading ","mm hmm "
16686,150.1,Luis,,"and that's why i pulled you ","class excuse me yes me "
16688,150.1,Luis,,,"i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16690,110.3,Luis,,"well that's great that you know so you can help us learn even more things about the space and then maybe you might even learn something new you never know thank you for sharing that though ","yeah okay perfect spot "
16696,110.1,Farrah,,"you get alright so let's look at some of your answers and we have that student and deb you had similar answers right you both said you need something like a microscope to look really closely ","Yeah, exactly. It's because our microscope is equipment. It's like a tool that you use to look at things that are really small. Yeah, in a science lab. "
16702,230.2,Farrah,,"and if you don't see it that's okay too ","it's in it's in part three it's in part three paragraph three they say you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope "
16706,210.2,Chris,,"Were talking about with our question that we were talking about referring to before it was what equipment just did scientists used to discover water on the moon. So who can tell me what is discover mean? ","It's like to to find something "
16709,210.4,Jazmin,,"Or maybe they use something else. ","yes yeah how can you find it if you can't see it "
16711,110.2,Jazmin,,"you're right but maybe you don't need the microscope to see it because water maybe there's enough of it that they could see it without student you have something to add ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16721,120.1,Jazmin,,"and then i want class to know if they want to change their answer ","um well i still think that's the small machine i don't want to change my answer you don't want it's a small machine "
16724,210.4,Jazmin,,"good and do you know what that small machine is called ","nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbiter "
16730,420.2,Chris,,"A small machine. That's awesome. But we want to expand on that you add in right from the texts like they said, called a lunar orbiter. So would you want to add that to your answer. ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16737,210.3,Chris,,"That they use to find that water. So what would you add Chris to your response about finding the water in that specific equipment. ","oh well i guess what you said to student is it that is the lunar orbiter so i guess i would say they use the orbiter to find the craters full of water "
16739,420.2,Chris,,"that's perfect beautiful i love that does it make more sense that you have to make sure you're answering the full question when they say equipment you have to remember their equipment and then you can add in those details you have those are awesome as well ","okay "
16744,420.2,Oliver,,,"actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but wanted to say thank you so much for coming today thank you for reminding us oh sorry "
16746,420.2,Oliver,,,"well yeah i wasn't it was really nice to meet you and we really appreciate how you helped us add more details to our answers in order to make them better "
16749,420.2,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you "
16752,420.2,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me i'm shutting me and that's class i already know all about space "
16762,120.4,Farrah,,"who would like to discuss their answer first ","yeah so i feel really good about my answer and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i know that a microscope is a tool and it sounds like they use it to look at the water "
16766,210.4,Chris,,"does class remember where they found the water ","yeah that was part of my answer they found the craters of water and the craters were full of water "
16770,130.1,Jazmin,,"so the equipment that we're looking for is the equipment that they use to get into these creators so wouldn't exactly be a microscope that they use to get into the craters to find it student just something you'd like to add ","um yes so um well i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16773,110.2,Jazmin,,"okay it's not necessarily wrong at all that's a great answer because you're right they did nasa did send a small machine ","yes out loud "
16776,110.2,Jazmin,,,"okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
16780,420.2,Jazmin,,"good so what do you think you could add to your sentence to your answer to make it even more detailed and more specific to the question ","It's called a Lunar Orbiter. "
16786,150.1,Oliver,,"but do you see how rereading back to the first sentence and paragraph to how the lunar lunar orbiter was something that they use to actually discover the water do you see the difference between that in the microscope ","honestly not totally like i got back maybe they used both but i don't really see why it's not the microscope "
16791,210.3,Oliver,,"so do you think they would use a microscope to get through these tough exteriors do you think that would be the best equipment that they used to specifically find the water ","um no i guess before you use a microscope you probably need something else "
16793,210.4,Oliver,,"do you remember what it's called look back to paragraph two ","oh yeah um i will i will answer yeah a lunar orbiter "
16795,150.1,Farrah,,"is that making sense to you student as well ","yeah yeah i understand it better now "
16797,150.1,Chris,,,"yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16802,120.4,Luis,,"student how are you doing because i know you mentioned the oxygen tanks as well ","i yeah that is what i had also said yes "
16806,150.1,Luis,,"do you understand now how it's more of the lunar order that they use to discover the water ","I mean, that sounds like a pretty good answer. I mean, I think also Chris's answer. I mean, with all the oxygen tanks and stuff. That was pretty good. because like on youtube they show how the astronauts like train with their oxygen tanks and in the old the zero gravity chambers and oh yeah "
16808,110.3,Luis,,"you do know a lot about space ","yeah i i'm kind of space expert on which is why i picked oxygen tanks that's my answer "
16810,420.2,Oliver,,"yeah just that was kind of from your prior knowledge yep so now we know to look you can use your prior knowledge and use what's in the article to answer those specific questions yes deb you have a hand up ","yeah well it's it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for really helping us understand what it meant to discover the water and not just like find it or i mean look for it yeah that was a really helpful explanation "
16813,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi "
16815,420.2,Farrah,,,"yeah yeah we can see you just fine "
16822,420.2,Luis,,"We're going to use writing right from the text to make sure we support our answers. So if we say no, there's something in the text that will support a no answer. And if we say yes, there will be something in the texts for a yes answer. Does anybody want to talk about their response first ","yeah well actually i just wanted to remind you that my dad as actually an astronaut "
16825,120.4,Luis,,"do you want to talk about your answer student ","um yeah yeah i can talk about my answer um so my answer is i'm water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
16827,230.2,Luis,,"awesome and i see you got that from the second sentence and paragraph five is that correct ","i am i sure did "
16836,210.4,Luis,,"in the next sentence can you find why it is important they can break water down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen ","okay the next sentence says astronauts could breathe the oxygen Yeah. not being asleep "
16839,120.4,Jazmin,,"class else want to talk discuss their answer yes student ","um so i was thinking you could use water to grow things and we can have a moon garden a garden on the moon "
16841,140.1,Jazmin,,"that's i love that answer do you like to garden yourself student ","yes i love to garden and i love to be in nature "
16847,230.2,Jazmin,,"i do have a question for you is there anything about using the water for growing things on the moon in the article do you remember or are you kind of just thinking of things that we do with water on earth ","when we look back at it well no i guess they don't talk about a garden but because there's water that's something you can use water for "
16852,210.4,Jazmin,,"what else do we use water for that is mentioned in paragraph four ","drinking Yeah. "
16856,150.1,Chris,,"Do you see how we could use that information. ","oh yeah because what you just said was a lot like my answer my answer is well water is so heavy so it's good that they wouldn't have to carry it on the ships anymore they could just get on the moon "
16862,230.3,Chris,,"so we know you told us it's good that they can have it with them and they don't have to bring as much so the astronauts can what with it ","they can drink it "
16868,530.1,Oliver,,"do you see any ways that your mind is kind of changing are you thinking differently now that you're hearing from your other friends and your class ","no no i'm not thinking differently because here you got look at this and in the text and part six that's where i got my answer because part six says if they're gonna use a moon water they need a plan to like got the moon water and that's going to take time and money so it's not like tomorrow they can just call up a moan and bring a water it's like they have to spend all this money to do that and that's going to take for ever "
16877,210.3,Oliver,,"so thinking about it that way if there's not think taking the logistics out of it and all the specifics that they've stated in the last paragraph taking all that out of it do you think there are valuable ways we could use the moon water for astronauts and whatnot ","i will show like the whole drinking water thing on the whole like breathing yeah um so that's really important but i guess i thought the question was just asking like if i thought it was a good idea like i convinced that we should i'm like all spend time on the water on the moon and so i wasn't convinced "
16882,210.4,Oliver,,"So thinking about such as using the water for oxygen is there evidence that we can break down water into oxygen and hydrogen into two parts? ","yeah that's science so yeah Definitely. "
16886,120.4,Farrah,,"That the water could be used for Farrah, do you have anything else to add, ","well so this is so fun and interesting but we have to go to lunch i'm really sorry but thank you so much for letting all of us express our ideas on this question because i had the same as student but i think my classmates convinced me that there's some some cool things you could use the water for and it was just really cool to listen to class so letting us do that "
16888,120.4,Farrah,,,"yeah bye "
16892,120.4,Farrah,,,"hi miss carpenter it's good to see you today "
16894,150.1,Farrah,,"wonderful i'm glad you're all here did you all read the assignment that i send out to you about finding water on the moon ","yes we did "
16897,220.1,Luis,,"very good so we are going to talk about the tool that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","excuse me x shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16899,140.1,Luis,,"you know all about space really where did you learn about space was it from a book or do you get to go to a museum ","oh well i like to watch a lot of videos like on youtube so i look at a lot of stuff on the internet like videos and learning about astronauts and watching launches of rocket oh it's so cool "
16901,110.3,Luis,,"i'm sure it is i hope that you'll be able to use some of that knowledge that know to talk about this exciting discovery of finding water on the moon ","yeah yeah okay "
16904,150.1,Luis,,"to find information within the text can you all do that ","um well actually our story it's on our tablet right in front of us so we can see it there "
16907,150.1,Luis,,,"yeah we have those too "
16911,120.4,Chris,,"s student thank you so much you're very brave to go first it's always a bit of a challenge so well done ","well i think the main point of part one is that it tells us that scientists actually found craters full of water on the moon "
16917,120.4,Farrah,,"right who's ready to share thank you ","well i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
16921,430.2,Farrah,,"but we want to explore a little bit further maybe there's more to the story than just what you gave in your answer and we want to go a little bit further we want to dig a little bit deeper ","yeah that sounds cool wd can do that yeah "
16923,230.2,Farrah,,"right what's what's the textual evidence to support chris's claim with the main idea of the first paragraph is that scientists found lots of water on the moon ","it says that like in the first sentence they found evidence that there's water deep in the polar craters but student i don't know if it's like full of water but um it's in the craters "
16929,210.4,Jazmin,,"class can review it in front of them and then when you're ready raise your hand and tell me what you think the main idea is in the second paragraph ","i think the main point of part two paragraph two is like that nasa sent a small machine "
16931,230.1,Jazmin,,"mm hmm very good can you elaborate on that does it say what the name of the small machine is ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter lunar orbiter "
16934,130.2,Chris,,"all right who agrees with student or student do you have something to say ","yeah so i went to nasa and i saw that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and all sorts of stuff like that "
16939,210.3,Chris,,"that's really really cool do you think that nasa used astronauts suits in oxygen when they sent a machine to the moon ","oh well if there were astronauts there soon yeah but maybe like you said doesn't let's say there were astronauts i "
16947,120.4,Oliver,,"student go ahead ","oh i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us go through a loop story and look for the main points because that's really helpful for us we're looking for the answers for the questions so thank you so much for introducing that to us because i know we'll use it next time "
16949,120.4,Oliver,,,"thank you "
16953,120.4,Farrah,,,"hi how are you today "
16955,150.1,Luis,,"doing good thank you for asking so you all read a passage about discovering water on the moon is that correct ","yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
16969,420.2,Chris,,"think about restating the question in your answer if you get stuck and you can't come up with something or always feel free to raise your hand if you're stuck need a little bit more help ","okay "
16971,420.2,Jazmin,,,"i was gonna say i don't understand why my answers wrong "
16975,420.1,Luis,,"you have a lot of background knowledge on this subject so i want you to go back to the question and identify what kind of equipment the question is asking about what did the scientists use the equipment to do and look for an action word in the question ","okay action word and question here we go "
16977,420.1,Farrah,,,"okay i'm feeling a little confused so you said to go back and look at the question and think about what the question was asking right "
16980,210.2,Farrah,,"indeed specifically what kind of equipment is the question asking for ","okay so well it's asking for equipment that they use to find the water on the moon and so on well i said it was the microscope because if the water is so tiny that on in order to find it you need a microscope to see it "
16985,230.3,Chris,,"From using a microscope to seem small microscopic bits of water. ","okay can do yeah so you told me to think about what or something about the question what did you say "
16989,230.3,Chris,,,"Yeah I did that. mm hmm and the the answer needs to be equipment and so well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
16992,210.3,Chris,,"very good does any of that equipment that you listed do you think that that equipment would be useful for finding water on the moon ","well i mean if there's astronauts there they definitely need those things "
16995,150.1,Chris,,"try to expand your knowledge about equipments that's astronauts might use they use things beyond suits and oxygen tanks as well there is some equipment in this passage that maybe you've never encountered before and you might discover yet another thing that's that astronauts us ","okay yeah i'll look for all look for some new stuff "
16997,150.1,Jazmin,,,"okay so you asked me to expand my answer and so while my answer was nasa send a small machine and so i found some more info it says nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and the lunar orbiter when land at the moon south pole and look for the ice to process "
17001,310.1,Farrah,,"that is very very very good student and i what i like about that is if i didn't know anything about this topic of finding water on the moon and i had never read this passage i could learn how the astronauts discovered water on the moon from your answer ","so it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for giving each one of us a different thing that we needed to do to help improve our answer instead of just like telling us all to do the same thing because that helped us know that you really read our answers and knew how to help each one of us individually "
17005,310.1,Farrah,,,"all right yeah good to see you i can tell "
17007,150.1,Luis,,"very good so we are going to do some discussion of your answers to the second question that was posed to all of you and one thing that i want to tell all of you class about this question yes student ","um i just want to remind do my dad as actually an astronaut "
17013,120.4,Chris,,"i'm going to start with student right there in the middle can you tell me what your answer to the question was remind me please ","yeah okay so i said water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
17015,230.2,Chris,,"and can you point out some evidence for the texts that tells you that astronauts will be able to not go into space with water on spaceships anymore ","yeah i think i found it oh oh yeah okay it's here on portal where it says water is heavy it takes up a lot of room on a spacecraft "
17017,230.2,Chris,,"very good could you saying is there anything more that the text says about water and how heavy it is ","having water vailable on the moon would leave more room on the spacecraft for people and things "
17020,230.2,Chris,,"do you find this to be compelling evidence that the water would be valuable ","oh yeah yeah i think that's important that they it's really heavy and so they could make the spacecraft's lighter or maybe bring other other equipment that's um that's important to "
17023,310.1,Jazmin,,"student what i really like what you just did there was that you started with an idea and then you came up with some of your own thoughts your own thought of maybe if they didn't have to carry heavy water they could carry other things as well i like that you expanded your thinking ","so you can use water to grow things so we could have an moon garden on the moon "
17026,230.1,Jazmin,,"could you tell me more about where you think we could have a moon garden or expand on that idea a little bit more i want to i want to see what you've imagined in your head ","yeah well if there's water you need water to have plants like you they could grow food and they could make them really beautiful and so if there was water i think that's an opportunity that they would have to use the water "
17029,120.4,Luis,,"student can you tell me what your answer was to the question ","yep sure can okay water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
17031,230.1,Luis,,"excellent and how does that make the water on the moon valuable to astronauts ","i can't remember it sounds pretty cool "
17033,230.2,Luis,,"does i'm pretty cool if you go back to the text and you reread the part of the tax the toxin that talks about that gives you that information about hydrogen oxygen being used for fuel is there anything around it that lets you know why that would be useful to astronauts ","oh yeah okay oh this is why this is why i picked this okay um it says oxygen and hydrogen could be used for rocket fuel "
17039,420.2,Oliver,,"The reason I asked Chris Jazmin and Luis for their opinions first was because I wanted you to see what it looks like to give supporting evidence from the text. What I want both of you to work on is you absolutely your answer is your opinion. ","Okay. well um so i said um it's not ready yet and it did say that it did say that on the story "
17042,230.2,Oliver,,"did can you tell me where it is in story i believe you i just i just need the actual text please ","oh okay so um and the last part it says i'm making a plan will take a lot of time and money like you can just go to the moon today and drink this water or anything because it's not ready yet and so i don't think it's that valuable because they need to spend all this time and money to make it to make it valuable "
17045,230.3,Oliver,,"that the amount of money that we put into invest in this we won't get returns ","on yeah well cuz that's another meaning of the word value like money um so i don't think i don't think they should spend all their money on that because remember there's not even that much water there's like four cups you can't drink at that there's not there's not a lot "
17049,420.2,Oliver,,"and that it would take a lot of money and investment to even use what water there is on the moon so i when i tell you to go back and finish up your work please use that evidence to support your answer ","before you before you talk to them and i'm so sorry it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say this was a really cool discussion because we got to hear so many different ideas and class had ideas that that had evidence to go with it and so that was really cool to see and hear their answers and their evidence so thank you so much "
17052,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
17054,420.2,Farrah,,,"we're good we're so excited for your class "
17060,120.2,Luis,,"so let's go ahead and start digging into what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah okay excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17062,110.3,Luis,,"well i'm glad you have an interest in space and i'm glad that you know what but maybe you can contribute a little bit of your knowledge to the rest of the class so you might find some use there ","okay yeah that sounds great i'd love to do that "
17066,120.4,Farrah,,"does class want to volunteer to go ahead and go first ","yeah okay i can go "
17069,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17071,230.3,Oliver,,"And I think someone else circled, the same answer as you. ","that was yeah that was me yeah i saw the same thing as student "
17073,230.1,Oliver,,"either you can explain why did you circle that ","yeah i can say that so well it's right there in the text and i know we have to find something in the text and well that is a scientific tool it's equipment and we know we need equipment for the answer to the question "
17076,130.2,Jazmin,,"that's a really good reason we do need to talk about the equipment in the text did class else have any other ideas ","i had a different answer and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17078,230.1,Jazmin,,"so could you walk me through your answer a little bit explain your reasoning behind it ","oh yes okay well it's it's right there in part two and it says that nasa send a small machine and it its job was to look in that in the craters at the ice deposits and i think that means that that's how they found the water "
17082,130.2,Luis,,"does class want to jump in ","oh yeah definitely well the thing is scientists can use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks too "
17085,120.4,Chris,,"so i think we have one more person we haven't heard from yet would you like to go ahead ","okay yeah well my answer is scientists found careers full of water on the moon "
17089,210.4,Chris,,"let's talk about specifically what equipment they use to discover water especially can we go back to the text and look at a place where it mentions discovering water ","okay yeah do you want us to reread it "
17095,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay class find any interesting clues ","yes okay well i i still think i still think that it's a small machine because in that part it says that they used it to investigate and that that word reminds me of discover so i still think that's the small machine "
17098,130.2,Chris,,"okay so you still think that that class else that has class else's opinion stayed the same or have they changed ","well okay so here's the thing um i went to nasa and so when i was reading this it made me think i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17100,230.2,Chris,,"yes good i'm glad you were able to connect to prior experience to that so how does that relate to what we're talking about in the text did you see anything in the text about things that they use ","oh oh well no i guess it's just when i read it it reminded me of going to nasa and i know that we have to say it whitman and so it made me think of that appointment "
17105,130.2,Farrah,,"does class else have any difference of opinions were anything else that they discovered what rereading the text ","okay well i'm i'm getting a little confused because i said the microscope and when i looked back at the text it says the water is microscopic and so and so i'm thinking how can you discover something if you can't see it don't you need to see it through the microscope if you're going to discover it "
17112,310.1,Oliver,,"so i can see where you would say microscope ","oh yeah i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and and we have to go to lunch and i'm really bummed because i feel like we're just getting to the park but i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of her answers and and letting us know that you you could see why we got those answers on that really that really helped us feel good about our answers thank you so much "
17118,150.1,Luis,,"all of you have done an excellent job and i know that you all are great thinkers i think that we can work a little bit harder to make your answers the absolute best you can do you have a question ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17120,150.1,Luis,,"you do student you absolutely do and your answer was so good that i think we can make it even better are you willing to be flexible and think with me ","um yeah okay "
17126,150.1,Farrah,,,"Some, some time in English class. Yes, please do. "
17134,110.2,Farrah,,"so student after i read your answer and your answer is wonderful you answered part of the question you found the equipment that they used right that ","yeah "
17137,120.3,Farrah,,"So I was hoping that maybe in your brain and your head quietly right now. Is there any way that you could reread paragraphs one and two. Actually let's start with just paragraph two. ","Like out loud or just on my own. "
17139,420.2,Farrah,,"um you can do it on your own okay and i want you to start working on the sentence starter okay do you need me to read that to you ","know i just little confused because i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17145,110.2,Farrah,,"so your answer is correct and you did a great job with your thinking ","that makes a lot of sense "
17149,420.2,Farrah,,"great i'm glad i'm so glad so if you could fill out this sentence starter for me ","okay i'll work on that "
17152,110.1,Oliver,,"i love it great job student ","good i'm doing well i can try that sentence starter if you want "
17154,120.4,Oliver,,"do you have something for me yeah ","okay it's on scientists to use a microscope to discover water on the moon and i found my answer in paragraph three "
17156,110.2,Oliver,,"student you did an amazing job with that sentence starter ","thanks "
17159,310.1,Oliver,,"and i wanted to say student i loved in your first answer that you agreed with student because that means that you're listening to your friends thinking ","yeah well i just said what i said before because like something i don't want first like if i had gone first i would have said microscope but she had already saw that so i just said what i saw "
17162,110.1,Chris,,"totally great job thank you that was awesome ","yeah okay "
17164,150.1,Chris,,"how's it going ","well i'm sure because because i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17166,140.1,Chris,,"person you are so passionate about space do you want to be an astronaut when you're older ","that would be pretty cool yeah "
17169,220.1,Chris,,"that would be really cool so student we're working on reading informational texts and the reason that we're doing this is so that you can start to learn how to write about informational texts i know that you know about space ","Oh, so like the equipment has to be like in the story. "
17172,120.1,Chris,,"so well i check in with student do you think that you could work on that a little bit ","yeah oh look oh look in the story again "
17177,120.3,Jazmin,,"yeah maybe reread it once or twice just to see okay ","i i'm ready with my answer "
17179,120.4,Jazmin,,"you ready okay let me hear it ","scientists used a small machine to discover the water and i found the answer in paragraph two "
17185,210.3,Jazmin,,"it could be a computer later right ","yeah right "
17188,420.2,Jazmin,,"so your answer is right but i think that we should add a little bit more detail and describe is there maybe an adjective or a name of that small machine that we could use ","oh oh it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
17193,420.2,Oliver,,"love it so student if you could rewrite your answer and maybe use that name that would be super helpful ","yeah actually are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much that sentence starter was so helpful and you really took you took the time to listen to every single one of us our answers and you just made us feel like like we've done a really good job and you helped us make our answers better to "
17197,420.2,Farrah,,,"hi it's nice to see you "
17200,150.1,Luis,,"cool detective hats and we're going to be looking in the text for answers okay student do you have a question ","yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17209,150.1,Oliver,,"connecting the information in your brain is also going to help you a lot but i just want to make sure that you're getting the best answer you can is that okay ","yeah i mean that sounds kind of fun Yeah, so the question is looking for a piece of equipment that's what the answer needs to be "
17211,210.2,Oliver,,"yeah now student can i challenge your thinking what does equipment mean do you know ","equipment is like something you use so could be like a tool or something "
17215,210.2,Jazmin,,"Where do you think we can find our answer Jazmin? ","we have to look in this story "
17220,130.2,Luis,,"actually student and student i think we're going to work together student are you are you with me ","yeah "
17224,310.1,Farrah,,"so both of you found your answers somewhere in the text you were it was clear that you read the text and i really love that you were looking at the text you definitely read it or at least looked at it which is great ","Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely. I don't understand why that answers wrong. "
17231,410.2,Farrah,,"i'm concerned about the way that you worded your answer student so the way that you worded your answer didn't really restate the question ","Um the scientists Yeah. so the scientists need a tool called on microscope "
17235,420.2,Farrah,,"So how would you restate that question. ","um so the scientists used a scientific tool called a microscope "
17239,130.1,Farrah,,"Yes. So that is one part of the one part of the answer. ","okay you want to have reread it Okay. "
17242,110.3,Luis,,"so student you definitely have knowledge on this subject ","oh yeah i know everything about space i watch all the videos on youtube all about space i pretty much know everything there is to know "
17252,210.4,Luis,,"And the answer, you'll find is in the text. ","Yeah, so the question is what equipment that scientists do stuff discover water on the moon. In the story, on oh okay i should probably really read it "
17255,210.4,Chris,,,"okay yeah so this is kind of like what student said but i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17259,430.2,Chris,,"totally and and that's very helpful but i do want us to practice being that reading detective right so i want you to find your answer in the text because i want us to practice that skill is that ok with you ","yeah i guess i can do that "
17262,430.2,Oliver,,,"yep "
17266,410.2,Oliver,,"i am concerned because you didn't really rephrase anything you just said i circled the same as savanna's that doesn't help me know if you understand the question or the answer ","Oh yeah. Well, I mean, I only said that because Farrah one but for me and like if I had gone. First I want to set it, but she went first. So if I had been first I would have said that the tool is a microscope. "
17269,130.1,Oliver,,"okay so there is another tool in there ","Um, I would really like to. But actually, we have to go. All right, so, um, thank you so much for making us detectives that was really kind of made looking at the text and searching for answers, I'm seem really cool. "
17272,130.1,Farrah,,,"hi "
17274,220.1,Luis,,"hey so today we're going to do something super cool we are going to be reading detectives okay so that means when we get a question about the text we are going to answer it by looking in the text okay student do question ","yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17279,220.1,Luis,,"because when we read informational texts this year you're going to need that skills okay ","well yeah "
17284,150.1,Luis,,"are you ready to be a reading detective ","and protective caps on here we go "
17286,150.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah of course "
17289,230.1,Luis,,"well first student before i became um what made you think that was the correct answer when you read the question what relied talk me through it ","okay so it said what equipment to the scientists use to the spot or the water on the moon and so if there are scientists and they're all my own that gonna need i need a lot of things but they're definitely gonna need oxygen tanks yeah they need to breathe when they're out there looking for the water "
17292,430.3,Luis,,"but i am a little bit concerned that you didn't find that answer in the text i want to suggest maybe you could go back and read the text again looking for the specific answer that you need do you want to try that ","um yeah i guess i probably be good if i read it "
17294,150.1,Luis,,"and you know what that might add to that information that's in your brain you might learn something new ","okay yeah good for him "
17296,150.1,Luis,,,"he yeah "
17299,150.1,Luis,,,"okay "
17301,150.1,Jazmin,,,"um yes i'm ready "
17303,230.1,Jazmin,,"awesome okay it's student so i was wondering what can you talk me through your answer ","yeah so i said nasa sent a small machine and i i don't understand why that's wrong "
17309,420.2,Jazmin,,"i was wondering can you describe the machine at all are there any adjectives in the texts that describe the machine ","oh well it says that the machine is small "
17311,210.4,Jazmin,,"what is the name of the machine ","yet it's called the lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposit in the polar craters "
17316,420.2,Jazmin,,"oh my goodness student you just answered my next question my next question was going to be what does the machine do could you add a little bit more detail into your answer ","yeah oh okay so i should say i should say that in my answer should i should say lunar orbiter And what that week, my answer. That's spectacular. "
17321,210.3,Oliver,,"that would make your answer spectacular ","oh yeah uh huh "
17323,430.3,Oliver,,"I am a little concerned that you didn't put it in your own words, because I don't know if you understood it, right. So I was wondering, is there any way that you could put the answer in your own words. ","no of course of course yeah i read it i hope you wrote that i love the text on my answer is that the tool is a microscope "
17325,210.3,Oliver,,"yes but i'm going to challenge you for a minute can i challenge you as a detective ","yeah "
17328,210.4,Oliver,,"there's actually another piece of equipment in there can you look to the text to find the answer for what that piece of equipment is ","and another one the microscope that's not it "
17331,130.1,Oliver,,"the microscope is a tool that they use but i think there's a more more important piece of equipment that they use ","oh okay i need to look for that because i thought a microscope and that's pretty important water's so small you need to see it "
17333,210.3,Oliver,,"totally know it's it is important but i would like you to look for the other one too okay ","yeah okay "
17338,230.1,Chris,,"so student can you talk me through your answer really quick ","actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say i know this time you didn't get to hear my answer but i heard class else and i know that you made class feel like their answer was really important and you understood why they said it but also you can help them make their answer spectacular and that that sounds really important "
17341,230.1,Farrah,,,"oh thank you hi hello "
17343,230.1,Farrah,,,"i'm mr stephen it's nice to meet you were doing good today "
17348,150.1,Luis,,"so can class tell me what you class were just reading about ","yeah so i'm sorry sorry um we were just reading about the water the water on the moon and i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
17351,150.1,Chris,,"can class tell me what this article was about ","yeah i can "
17353,150.1,Chris,,"tell me what was this article about ","well it was about how they found water the phone craters are full of water on the moon "
17356,110.1,Jazmin,,"thank you for that information student ","yeah i can add this is student "
17358,130.2,Jazmin,,"student add on ","well to find the water nasa send a small machine "
17362,210.4,Luis,,"does class know what that machine is called ","oh yeah i know this i know this event um it's the lunar orbiter it says that reading the story itself lunar orbiter mm hmm yeah student that's the name of it it's all lunar orbiter "
17366,150.1,Oliver,,"does class else want to add anything else interesting that they weren't from this article ","well i learned that the water it's really really small it's so small because you need a microscope to see and yeah that was my answer that you need a microscope "
17371,150.1,Farrah,,"does class else want to add anything else while we have a few minutes left student ","um well i also sent them microscope like student and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17376,130.2,Farrah,,"does class want to help student make answer stronger ","um i can do it i can do it i'm like you should have said i'm lunar orbiter because that's it that's what they said but but the text also talks about student it talks about the microscope to so you just i came not going to just change my answer as it talks about the microscope "
17383,130.2,Jazmin,,"do you agree or disagree ","i think that's a microscope it says it says no said also machine how the lunar orbiter to investigate so which one is it "
17386,130.2,Chris,,"student what do you think do you agree with student endeavor do you agree with student and student why ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17388,110.1,Chris,,"well student who do you agree with ","um well "
17390,130.2,Chris,,"do you thin they used the microscope do you think that they used the lunar orbiter why or why not ","well maybe maybe both "
17392,230.1,Chris,,"why do you think that ","well because i got some little story they say you need the lunar orbiter to investigate like student and student set but i guess also i mean if the water so small like student and student said then you need a microscope because how can you how can you discover it if you can't see it "
17396,130.2,Luis,,"what do you class think what do you class think the answer is then ","i have a question "
17399,130.2,Luis,,,"i don't think of microscope is right you class you class i don't think it's right because i think that in the lunar orbiter there weren't even astronauts there weren't even astronauts there right it was just the lunar orbiter like like an unmanned craft and so they wouldn't eat up microscope if there are like you know as a righty "
17402,130.2,Luis,,"do you agree with her thinking do you disagree with her thinking why oh ","i'm sorry that was student i should have raised my hand "
17406,130.2,Chris,,"student make sure that we're raising her hand what do we think ","i think oh sorry it's student i think i think student might be right because well at nasa some of the spaceships they can go without astronauts but if it went with astronauts they probably knew the microscope but maybe they use the microscope like after "
17409,130.2,Oliver,,"does class want to add some more detail student thank you for raising your hand ","yeah well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you for encouraging us to add more detail and to really listen to and build on each other's answers and talk about which one we thought was right because that really helped us think about what the article said so thank you so much "
17411,130.2,Farrah,,,"hi good afternoon "
17414,140.1,Oliver,,"good afternoon class how is class doing please raise your hand ","oh you just said raised her hand um so i just wanted to say i'm having a really good day "
17416,140.1,Luis,,"oh thank you student would class else like to tell us about their day before we move forward student ","yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17424,120.4,Chris,,"student what's the main idea of this text ","okay so i think the main idea is that they have found water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know because they found it "
17427,120.4,Jazmin,,"and i will go it's student ","okay so um student i agree partly like yes it's definitely about water on the moon but i think it's also about how there's not a lot of water on the moon like it's only on these really small little bits "
17432,130.2,Farrah,,"would class like to add anything else to what they think the main idea of this text is ","okay well so this on this connects to a student said student said the waters really small and this also connects to my answer so the scientists they had to use a microscope to find the water you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely at it so um i guess i just i don't really understand why my answer is wrong "
17440,150.1,Chris,,"i don't see class raising their hand this means that we understand what we need to do ","okay so um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17445,230.2,Chris,,"What details in the text or what specific equipment are mentioned in the text that scientists used to discover water Chris. ","so the equipment from the story "
17447,230.2,Chris,,,"reach every reader let me look don't remember "
17450,230.2,Jazmin,,,"i found another piece of equipment in the story additional additional to the microscope and that was actually my answer and it's nasa sent a small machine "
17456,420.3,Jazmin,,"if you're not sure what to do you can always go back in the text to where you found that piece of information and see if maybe they use a specific name ","for that piece of equipment okay yeah so it says on that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter "
17459,210.4,Luis,,"can class tell us what this orbiter did someone we haven't heard from yet ","um yeah it says it student right next on what you said it says that the lunar orbiter investigates and looks for ice and the polar craters "
17464,310.1,Oliver,,"so you're saying that the lunar orbiter investigates polar craters for ice that's a very strong answer because you look in the text and you quoted the text directly ","um excuse me yes student um we we have to go it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for really directing us to look back in the text and to find our answers in the text that was really helpful "
17466,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi we're excited to get started "
17470,230.1,Luis,,"how did you class arrive that you're thinking ","um well i just wanted to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
17473,430.2,Luis,,"it's good that you are connecting outside information to your answer i'm concerned that you didn't answer the question directly but you provided evidence why don't you go back decide if you think water is valuable or not and whether or not your evidence supports your answer ","okay you want me want me to read it again "
17477,120.2,Chris,,"what else do people think is water valuable why or why not ","okay well um water is heavy so it's good that they don't have to carry it on the ships anymore "
17482,420.2,Chris,,"i'm wondering if you can push your thinking further and ask why having more space on a spaceship is good ","Okay, yeah. Oh, I'll take a look "
17488,520.1,Jazmin,,"i'm wondering what you'll do next time you get a question like this to arrive at an answer like this what's something that you can do next time when you get a question like this ","well i i got my answer just from from reading the text and i looked for evidence and another thing i did was i kind of thought about what made water useful so i'm drinking was one thing and another thing that i was thinking is that you could maybe use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the moon "
17493,130.2,Oliver,,"did class else use a strategy similar to student or differently to student and how did it help them or how did it yeah how did that help them to do this work student ","um well okay i'm student she said about how she read it and she she thought about it and look for evidence and i think i did something similar but i actually came up with a different opinion so i think part of part of the question was having an opinion "
17498,230.2,Oliver,,"i'm wondering how is your answer different from student and what evidence did you use to explain how your you got a different answer from student and what evidence you used ","um yeah definitely okay so i said no there is not convincing evidence because i'm though the water isn't ready yet i mean it's not like you could just go to the moon today and i'm drink the water and plant a garden so i wasn't convinced because it said right there and part six it's gonna take a lot of time and money "
17500,230.1,Oliver,,"what do you think you would have needed to see from this text to be convinced that it was valuable ","oh i think maybe i'm that "
17503,110.1,Oliver,,"student i see your hand will call on you next ","um i think i would be convinced to maybe if it wasn't so hard to get the water and also from the first part if there was more water because it said there's only like four cups that's really not enough for all the astronauts to drink i don't think it's worth all the money "
17505,110.1,Chris,,,"oh well i just wanted to see i did i did what you asked and i looked for more reasons and i found out that water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
17507,230.1,Chris,,"um can you tell me more about this ","um oh okay i'm oxygen and hydrogen could be used as rocket fuel "
17510,430.2,Chris,,"i'm concerned about whether this is a good thing or a bad thing and why can you tell me if this is good or bad and why ","oh it sounds pretty good to be like i'm extra rocket fuel that's probably really on like necessary when you're flying in space "
17514,230.1,Farrah,,"can class tell me how it feels answering these opinion questions ","oh well i really want to answer but we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you heard every single one of our answers and also understood where our answers came from and that just made us really feel that you were listening and that you cared about every single one of our answers so thank you so much "
17516,230.1,Farrah,,,"hi "
17519,150.1,Farrah,,"welcome to reading task water on the moon have you read it ","yeah we've all read it already "
17525,120.2,Luis,,"the question is what equipment at data centers to use to discover water on the moon ","excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
17528,110.3,Luis,,"it's okay ","yeah that sounds great "
17531,150.1,Luis,,"did you have the chance ","we read it we read it already "
17533,120.4,Farrah,,"okay so um you can answer the question now ","can i go first "
17536,120.4,Farrah,,"student please go ahead ","i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17540,110.1,Farrah,,"um thank you student you are very close ","well the water on the moon the story said it's so small you can't see it "
17543,110.1,Farrah,,,"so they need to use the microscope so that they can see it so that you could look really closely at it "
17545,150.1,Farrah,,"Do you agree. ","oh so before they can use the microscope they have to use something else "
17549,110.4,Farrah,,"yes you are right ","can look again yeah "
17551,110.4,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
17554,110.4,Jazmin,,,"well i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17556,210.4,Jazmin,,"what did the scientists call the small machine ","let me see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
17558,110.4,Jazmin,,"great so the small machine is the lunar ","lunar orbiter "
17561,110.4,Jazmin,,"yeah your right ","so so i just had to say the name and then my answer would be right "
17565,110.4,Chris,,"yes you are your right ","my answer was different because i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17568,210.2,Chris,,"now we need to figure out how they find it i mean what equipment or machine they are using to discover the water ","oh so i have to say the machine "
17572,210.2,Chris,,,"what they used so then i guess it's i guess it's the lunar orbiter "
17575,110.4,Chris,,"all right the lunor orbiter ","okay so i just have to i have to make sure i i say the equipment okay "
17583,120.4,Oliver,,"share with us your answer ","yeah well i hope the same answer i'll student about the microscope so i'm still totally sure why that's not right Well, I guess it's true observe "
17585,210.2,Oliver,,"so the question is asking us to find what equipment the scientists used to discover the water not the equipment used to observe the water ","hey okay okay so they use the lunar orbiter to discover on the microscope to observe "
17588,110.4,Chris,,"yes you are right ","well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17591,110.2,Luis,,"yes i agree with you ","yeah i i also know that because i know a lot about space so i know that they have to use oxygen tanks to yeah i know that "
17594,110.2,Luis,,"yeah so i think a lot is a good guessing ","well because there's no oxygen is based on the astronauts would need them or else i couldn't breathe up there they need them to survive "
17597,110.4,Luis,,"yes so the oxygen tanks are providing oxygens right ","Uh huh, uh huh. "
17599,120.1,Luis,,"yeah so maybe you need to look at a text and more closely and the find the answer ","okay "
17603,150.1,Oliver,,"any other questions ","are just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really help those understand that we needed to find not just like any old equipment but the equipment that was used to discover and you helped make that really clear for us so really thank you so much "
17606,150.1,Farrah,,"hello boys and girls i'm what i'm going to do today is to introduce you a new strategy together then you are going to practice it and in a small class and i will come to talk to you a little more individually later if you still have some progress okay ","yeah that sounds great "
17608,150.1,Luis,,,"excuse me "
17610,150.1,Luis,,,"um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17612,110.3,Luis,,"great it look like you're an expert in our class so maybe you can help your classmates to clarify some background knowledge okay ","oh yeah that sounds awesome "
17616,420.1,Oliver,,"pick up a pen or a pencil and i'd like you to circle the words that you think are the most important words in the question ","okay yeah "
17620,420.1,Oliver,,"please remember to circle the most important words that helped you to find a specific place in the passage to answer a question ","yeah i think we're all ready "
17624,210.2,Farrah,,"okay so first one of the keywords that are used is to discover ","um yeah i can share "
17627,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah go ahead student ","so i thought the keyword the most important word was equipment because that word tells you that you're looking for like a tool for your answer "
17630,420.3,Farrah,,"Now you can use the words you circled ""equipment"" and go back to the middle of the passage and see what specific equipment is listed there. Okay? ","yeah should i tell you my answer "
17632,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah you can share ","um so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
17636,120.4,Chris,,"yes student go ahead ","on so i said water because my answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon and the whole story is about water "
17639,410.2,Chris,,"my concern is you didn't include any equipment in your answer ","yeah i guess no "
17641,210.3,Chris,,"yes and because you told me an equipment is the most important words in the answer so what do you think how will you revise your answer to include the equipment ","oh well okay so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17644,120.4,Jazmin,,"yes student what is your question ","yeah actually maybe i can help student because my word that i picked was discover "
17647,430.2,Jazmin,,"but my concern is would you look carefully at the passage i think you have targeted the right place in the passage you just need to be a little more specific ","oh okay so well my answer was nasa sent a small machine "
17649,230.3,Chris,,"yes and so student do you notice what student just said she said the machine that discovered was a small machine right ","yeah oh yeah that was in part two the small machine "
17651,420.2,Luis,,"yes so you class just need to be a little more specific what kind of machine was used to discover water ","oh i remember i remember from the story "
17653,120.4,Luis,,"yes student go ahead ","um it said it was a lunar orbiter nasa sent a small machine called lunar orbit are to investigate "
17655,150.1,Farrah,,"great so do you notice what student said ","um yeah he he read the whole sentence and so it said the name of the machine "
17657,150.1,Farrah,,"yes so the machine is the lunar orbiter do you agree ","yeah yeah that's what it says in the text "
17659,150.1,Oliver,,,"so it's it's time for us to go now but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us and being so specific which what with them with what each one of us could improve about our response on that really helped each one of us think about what our next steps could be free you can see "
17663,420.1,Luis,,"okay now please read the question again you are going to find out the key all important words in a question before you answer it ","um yeah i understand but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17665,110.3,Luis,,"wow great you know a lot about space so you may be an expert in our class so you can help our classmates to clarify their misunderstanding or all the things they want to know okay ","yeah sounds great "
17670,420.1,Farrah,,"pick up a pen or a pencil and circle the words that you think are the most important in a question the words you are going to circle will help you to find out a specific place in the passage to answer a question ","yes yes i think we are finished "
17672,210.3,Farrah,,"okay so what was one of the keywords that are you circled student ","oh so the word i picked from the question but i thought was most important was equipment "
17676,210.4,Farrah,,"and so please go back to the meat of the passage and see what a specific equipment is listed there ","okay "
17680,210.3,Oliver,,"and class else do want to show you your keywords ","oh yeah well i picked the same as student because equipment and we also we also have the same answer too we work together a lot and both of us said it was a microscope because that's equipment "
17684,210.3,Oliver,,"yes great and i appreciate that you used the evidence from the text but do think microscope is the best answer ","um yeah i do because it's a scientific tool just like it says right there in part three microscope is a scientific tool um yeah so that's aw yeah the keyword "
17686,210.3,Jazmin,,,"yes i picked an action word i picked the word discover from the question "
17692,210.3,Oliver,,"when you add reading a passage and talk about what you will change and why you change that in your answer ","Yep. Sounds great. "
17694,120.4,Chris,,"okay all right let's talk in our class about no question student can you read your answer that you gave ","okay yeah so my answer to the question was scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17701,110.2,Chris,,"okay i really appreciate that you give us a fact and exactly evidence for all the passage when you answer the question ","well okay well it kind of goes along with my my keyword because i said the keyword was water and the whole story is about water and they found the water like all this water in the crater I hadn't hadn't heard of that just yet. "
17703,410.2,Chris,,"yes and so equipment is an important word in the question but you didn't include any equipment in your answer ","yeah i didn't include equipment i just said like where they found the water "
17709,420.2,Chris,,"yes so how will you revise your answer to include the equipment ","yeah i'll have to i'll have to put some equipment in my answer to make sure it answers the question Well, I went to NASA. So I know scientists use a lot of equipment actually like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. OK. OK. "
17711,130.2,Jazmin,,"and then student how about you you maybe help us later to help out out student and student to answer the question because your answer is nasa sent a small machine right ","yes "
17715,210.3,Jazmin,,"how you will make your answer more specific ","oh well what if i use the keyword like i could said i could say nasa sent a small machine to discover the water "
17720,310.1,Oliver,,"Yeah, I like it. You had a target to the right place in the passage you for the answer. ","i'm so sorry i looked at the clock we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say this was so helpful thank you for for finding something good in each of our answers but also challenging us to look back on and reread for even more detail and even stronger answers that fit with a keywords that was a really helpful strategy "
17723,310.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you today "
17725,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're good thanks for asking "
17728,310.1,Oliver,,,"um yeah so i'm student my name is student oh sorry "
17731,310.1,Chris,,,"oh hi it's nice to meet you my name is student "
17734,310.1,Jazmin,,,"hi my name is student "
17736,310.1,Luis,,,"yeah so my name is student and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17740,150.1,Farrah,,"teacher correct ","that's correct "
17742,120.4,Farrah,,"teacher awesome so student what did you say what was your response for the understanding what equipment did scientists use ","i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17744,230.2,Farrah,,"teacher so a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely okay did you find evidence of that in the text ","in part three it talks about the microscope and how the water is really small "
17748,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah so it says it's microscopic so although microscope or microscopic start with the same beginning they mean two different things so microscopic means it's really small ","well so that says right it says right after that you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i took that word right from the story "
17751,230.3,Oliver,,"teacher and student i saw that you said you circle the same as student ","yeah i also thought it was a microscope because that's a tool and on the question asked for equipment that's equipment "
17754,310.1,Jazmin,,"right so i could see where that would get confusing ","I have a question. "
17756,310.1,Jazmin,,,"well i understand why my answer as well "
17763,230.2,Luis,,"teacher student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks where did you see oxygen tanks ","oh well i just know a lot about space because i watch videos on youtube and i watch stuff about rocket launches and i really know a lot about astronauts so um i just know that the astronauts would have needed oxygen tanks "
17768,150.1,Luis,,"Teacher : Does that make sense. Luis ","so you're saying like because it's um it's not in the story i need to pick something from the story "
17770,420.2,Luis,,"right so i would like to see you use some context from the story to be able to answer that question does that make sense ","yeah i should probably read it "
17772,110.1,Luis,,"teacher okay student reread and then i'd like to see if you can get a different answer okay ","yeah yeah okay "
17775,230.3,Chris,,"teacher awesome and student i saw you said scientists found craters full of water on the moon ","yeah so cool "
17777,210.3,Chris,,"teacher yes it's very very cool but is that equipment were craters equipment ","no no craters not equipment but that's where they've had to find the water "
17779,210.3,Chris,,"teacher right so how did they get there though what equipment do they use to find it ","oh well um i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen takes like student was saying and masks and suits "
17785,120.4,Oliver,,"teacher student student student student did you hear anything ","well um this is student i heard you say lunar orbiter i'm like i know you said that sorry to answer because you can told student but i still don't really understand why it's not the microscope from part three because that's also equipment and they also needed to find the water "
17789,210.4,Oliver,,"paragraph three says that the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth so is the water on the moon big or small ","it's definitely small "
17793,210.4,Oliver,,"what does a microscope do ","well it lets you look at things that are really small Well yeah, I think. "
17796,210.3,Oliver,,"teacher right so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely but that doesn't necessarily say that nasa sent a microscope to look really closely it does it ","i guess it doesn't say that nasa sent it "
17799,210.4,Oliver,,"right so where in the article do you see a sentence that starts with nasa sent ","okay and part two i'm oh oh man oh i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and helping us find the right sentence and the text and looking for the right words to help us answer the question that's really helpful for us at this article and also for our next time "
17802,210.4,Farrah,,,"nice to see you "
17804,120.2,Luis,,"you as well so our first question from the article that we read that we have to respond to was the question what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student do you have a question ","um yeah i should be in this class i already know all about space "
17806,150.1,Luis,,"student that's awesome that you know so much about space but we're going to expand our knowledge today as a class okay ","ok ok "
17810,150.1,Chris,,"alright are we all set or do we need more time ","i think we're ready "
17812,120.4,Chris,,"alright so student what were the keywords that you underlined from the sentence ","well i said that the keyword was water because my answer was about the craters full of water on the moon "
17816,120.4,Oliver,,"student would you like to share ","okay sure yeah i had a different keyword from student and mine was on equipment "
17820,230.1,Farrah,,"okay student why did you circle equipment ","well because when it says equipment that means you have to look for like a tool for your answer and so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope and so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
17824,120.4,Luis,,"student what did you think ","well i also said equipment "
17826,230.1,Luis,,"why did you say equipment ","yeah i think for the same reasons that student and i know because i know so much about space i know there's so much equipment that you need and like you can't do anything without equipment so it just seems like really important you know "
17829,230.3,Jazmin,,"right so there is a lot of equipment that we need to utilize especially with space ","oh i thought that the most important word in the question was discover "
17831,230.1,Jazmin,,"discover okay why discover ","well because that's sort of like the action like what they did "
17837,420.3,Chris,,"okay so i want you right now to reread the text or the article and i want you to circle any word that you might think is equipment is that clear ","yeah so me and student we're gonna reread it and circle all the equipment that we find is that right "
17839,420.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah because i went to nasa so i know that scientists used a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17841,150.1,Chris,,"right so you have some background knowledge so let's read and see if we can find any other pieces of equipment okay ","okay yeah "
17843,120.4,Jazmin,,"all right well you do that deb student and student do you have a question ","oh no no question i'm going to read too "
17846,120.4,Oliver,,"what about you student and student do you feel like you need to reread or what did you talk about in small class ","well we agree that the microscope was a piece of equipment and they probably used it to to look at the water and then the only other piece of equipment we saw was the small machine "
17848,210.4,Luis,,"what was that small machine name do you remember ","oh i know i know i know i know it's the lunar orbiter "
17851,210.4,Luis,,"so you talked about the small machine that they used and what did they use that machine to do ","says that they they used it to investigate and it looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
17853,120.3,Oliver,,"okay and student can you reread that first question ","okay um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
17855,210.3,Farrah,,"okay and so student after hearing the equipment and what it was used for in the question number one do you think that lunar orbiter is the right tool or do you think the microscope is after doing more research ","well i guess i'm still a little confused like it definitely sounds like lunar orbiter is a good answer but i guess i still think microscope is a good answer too "
17857,110.1,Oliver,,"okay so you still think that lunar orbiter is a good job student do you have a question ","oh yeah well i just actually i wanted to say that it's time for us to go but i wanted to say thank you for having us look at that question so closely today "
17862,120.4,Chris,,"so we were talking about the different equipment and student and student were rereading the article so student and student would you like to share with the class any of the equipment that you circled from the reading ","oh yeah yeah okay definitely so well we found the same to that student and student i guess because there's the small machine on the lunar orbiter and then at the end it talks about the microscope "
17864,230.3,Luis,,"right so you found the lunar orbiter and the microscope nice student ","yeah i just wanted to remind you my dad as actually an astronaut "
17868,120.3,Farrah,,"Farrah. Can you read the question for me that you're trying to answer. ","huh yes it's um what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
17871,210.4,Farrah,,"did the microscope help find water on the moon ","i i thought it did because it's like how can you find something if you can't see it if it's too small for you to see how can you find it without something like a microscope huh "
17874,120.3,Farrah,,"can you reread the part in the article about the microscope for me please student ","yeah out loud "
17877,120.3,Farrah,,,"okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17881,120.3,Chris,,"and then student can you reread the part about the lunar orbiter ","Yeah, I can do that. Definitely. Um, it says, let's see, NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the moon's South Pole and lock her ice deposits and a large polar crater. just right there or do you want me to keep going "
17883,120.3,Chris,,"um can you read the next two sentences for me ","mm hmm yeah okay these ice deposits are very small scientists said that one ton of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water "
17887,210.4,Luis,,"student can you summarize what the paragraph said ","i'm the one that student read i mean the one that student read yes yeah okay so it said that they sent the lunar orbiter and it looked at the moon and it found a water but it was actually ice and it was in the craters and there's like not that much of it "
17889,230.3,Luis,,"right so you told me the they found the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon but it was ice right ","yeah it was frozen "
17891,230.3,Farrah,,"okay so the lunar orbiter found the water on the moon and then student you were saying at the microscope helps us to look at the water right ","right yeah because it's so small like student was saying "
17893,210.3,Jazmin,,"right so student which tool do you think found the water the lunar orbiter or do you think the microscope did ","well my answer to begin with was the small machine so i still think that's right and i don't really see what was wrong with my answer nasa sent a small machine "
17896,230.1,Jazmin,,"do you have a name for the small machine ","oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter we've been talking about it like this whole time "
17902,130.2,Chris,,"student do you agree with student ","well yeah i agree with student i think would make sense that the lunar orbiter discovered it because i know from science class or a bit means to like go around so i'm picturing the orbiter like going around and around the moon and i can't really see how a microscope kind of fits into that so yeah i think that it saw the lunar orbiter and i was thinking i first thought it was these craters full of water but it sounds like there wasn't that much "
17905,510.1,Chris,,"student you are using your background knowledge of a definition of orbiter to be able to apply your answer ","yeah exactly yeah because we learned that word orbit "
17907,130.2,Farrah,,"you learn the word orbit and student what did student say what does it mean ","it means to go around "
17910,230.3,Farrah,,"to go around right so student shared that the lunar orbiter went around the moon looking for something ","the small pieces of ice "
17914,210.3,Farrah,,"the small pieces of ice so did the lunar orbiter find the water or did the microscope find the water ","oh yeah that's making more sense that the lunar orbiter is what like i'm a bit like detected it and then and then they used a microscope to like look at it and study it "
17917,230.3,Farrah,,"than you you were able to use the context of your microscope which is another tool to be able to say that the microscope is going to help study the water which is small pieces correct ","yeah yeah that makes sense now "
17920,150.1,Oliver,,"okay so student can you summarize what student just said for me ","all yeah i sure can she said that on the oh i wasn't really listening i think it was thought on the lunar orbiter like found it and then the microphone all like looked at it "
17922,130.2,Luis,,"student is student right ","yeah i mean it's like close enough he couldn't he has to better words i think but yeah he got the idea "
17926,110.1,Oliver,,"okay so student and student than right he got the right idea yes student ","um well actually yeah i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to us and really helping us connect what we already knew like our background knowledge with the text and also helping us understand when we were using it to answer the question instead of actually using what's in the article in front of us that was so helpful thank you very much "
17929,110.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
17932,150.1,Luis,,"reading my name is teacher so we're going to be digging a little bit deeper into our discussion questions on reading about water on the moon ","yes me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
17939,150.1,Oliver,,"so i like a lot of these answers but why don't we i think that we need to take a step back with some of these answers ","it says nasa sent a machine called all lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quarter these are still deposits are very small "
17943,210.4,Chris,,"what did nasa do ","i was just raising my hand well they found the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
17949,210.4,Jazmin,,"So what did the, what was the first thing they did in that first sentence. ","and so sent a small machine "
17952,210.4,Jazmin,,"So we know that NASA found Ice deposits that were very small, but the first way that they found or the first step in defining that was sending a small machine there. ","that's what i said for my answer nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why the answer was wrong "
17959,120.3,Farrah,,"but let's read the next step so can someone read the third paragraph out loud to me ","yeah i can read it i'll do it now this means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't to be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
17962,210.4,Farrah,,"the water that they found is microscopic so it's tiny and they even explain to us it means that you wouldn't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it so what was the scientific tool needed to see something so small ","well it was a microscope that was my answer "
17970,130.2,Luis,,"to someone want to try to put that into one answer ","i could do it i can do it oh you want me to do it put that put the answers together this is student "
17973,130.2,Luis,,,"yeah okay so if you just put those the two the two things together it's like i'm on nasa sent a small machine and it was a lunar orbiter and then by looked at the small water with a microscope "
17976,130.2,Chris,,"did class want to add anything to that i can i still see a hand student ","yeah i would have to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
17981,410.2,Chris,,"If you provided that information that you just told me, Chris, which is great background knowledge, the person who's reading this won't know where you got that information from it doesn't apply to this question. Does that make sense to you? ","so it's because it's not in the story "
17983,310.1,Chris,,"that's right yeah but again that's excellent background knowledge because background knowledge always helps us understand what we're learning about even better it gives us almost like a little step ahead ","yeah yeah that's that makes sense yeah "
17985,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i'm wondering because i don't think about the lunar orbiter i don't think it had astronauts on it so did the astronauts did they need a microscope because if there weren't any astronauts they're not like walking around looking looking through a microscope on them right "
17991,210.4,Luis,,"the first paragraph says the equipment that the scientists used included a small machine called the lunar orbiter ","Oh, okay. So even though they didn't use it on the moon. It was like, they still had to use it like later. "
17994,110.4,Oliver,,"they still had to use it correct ","excuse me must go on i just looked at the clock it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us understand how to put our answers together and make the most specific answer for the question we really appreciate that you taught us that today thank you very much "
18000,150.1,Luis,,"so we're all here together because there's we all know we all answered the questions individually but we all could use a little bit of work on just fixing those answers just a little bit yes student ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18004,120.3,Chris,,"so can someone read the question out loud to me ","yeah i'll read it "
18007,120.3,Chris,,,"okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
18009,120.4,Oliver,,"Yeah Oliver give it a try. ","okay well i think the keyword as equipment because you have to know that you're looking to find a tool to answer the question "
18013,120.4,Farrah,,"so who wants why don't we start with student could you tell me what you actually wrote for your answer ","oh yeah sure okay i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18016,120.4,Jazmin,,"so how about student could you actually read what you wrote ","So I said that NASA sent a small machine, and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
18025,120.4,Jazmin,,"Yeah, Jazmin. Go ahead. ","well i think that it's a small machine that has to go first "
18028,230.2,Farrah,,"farrah's nswer i can find that right in paragraph two whereas i'm sorry not student jazmin's answer i can find in paragraph two but student where did you find your answer ","on part three "
18030,120.4,Oliver,,"right go ahead student did you have a question ","i do have a question yes so i'm not sure i agree with student because what i'm thinking is if the water is so small that you can't even see it without a microscope then how can you find it if you can't even see it "
18038,120.3,Oliver,,"each ice deposits are very small scientists said that one top 10 of the top layer of the moon surface would hold in total about 32 ounces of water that's just like four glasses of water about what one person might drink in a day ","oh no that's okay that's okay you can keep going "
18040,150.1,Chris,,"do you have a question ","yeah so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists do use a lot of equipment like on oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18047,420.2,Chris,,"to use evidence from the text in front of us ","so it has to be a piece of equipment from the story "
18049,130.3,Farrah,,"that's right that's right so we're going to begin by step one mentioning the lunar orbiter and step two would be mentioning the microscope yes student ","well actually it's it's time for us to go right now but i wanted to say thank you for reminding us that we have to go back and read the whole thing to make sure that we didn't just pick part of the answer but we actually find the whole answer "
18055,150.1,Luis,,"we're going to be going over our responses to our comprehension question regarding the text on the moon ","um yeah okay um before i do that i just wanted to say um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18059,120.3,Luis,,"so why don't we all work on that together so could you go ahead and read that question out loud to me student ","yeah okay um the question as what equipment at scientists to is to discover water on the moon "
18063,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah student what do you think ","so i said that nasa send a small machine "
18066,230.2,Jazmin,,"hmm and where did you find that ","it's in part two "
18070,130.2,Farrah,,"does class have a different answer or did they find any other information about any equipment yeah student go ahead ","yeah so i picked a different piece of equipment and student picked and i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18074,210.3,Farrah,,"so do we think that maybe we just should include both of those responses to make one response together ","that's it that's all we need to do "
18083,120.4,Oliver,,"does someone want to give it a try and try to combine those two answers maybe student ","oh yeah okay well yeah cuz my my first answer was the same as some animals about the microscope to if you put the two together i guess you just say on that the scientists used a lunar orbiter and a microscope "
18088,120.1,Oliver,,"You can, did you want to give that a try. ","um yeah well before i do that i just wanted to say i'm student and student i think you're wrong i don't think i don't think they use a microscope because i mean i know it talks about it like sorry and stuff but can you can you even picture like if there was an astronaut and they weren't like walking all around that big giant moon what like a microscope like i can't imagine that "
18090,230.1,Oliver,,"um i know that does sound funny so what makes you think that the scientists were on the moon with the microscope ","like i mean that's what i mean that's why i mean i don't think they use a microscope because i don't think there were any astronauts there "
18096,150.1,Luis,,"does that make a little more sense student ","yeah yeah yeah that's what i thought that's kind of what i thought our first place that it was was most like that the lunar orbiter "
18100,210.4,Chris,,"right so then with the microscope in paragraph three it's suggesting that the scientists were using the microscope when they were examining it back here on earth ","well surely so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i don't understand why why that's not the right answer "
18106,410.2,Chris,,"for example i know that you went to nasa because you've talked about it however maybe student doesn't know that so if he was reading your response he may question where you got that evidence and if it's truly valid ","Okay, yeah. thanks for explaining got it "
18110,150.1,Oliver,,"does class else have any other questions to clarify this response ","what i wanted to try the thing you said where we put it all together and i'm use the words from the question "
18113,150.1,Oliver,,,"okay so equipment that the scientists used to discover the water was on the lunar orbiter then later like student said they used a microscope "
18115,520.1,Oliver,,"that's right that's excellent so now when we go forward and we're answering comprehension questions you can use dev's amazing example where we restate the question and we're sure to use all of the evidence from the text ","thank you and actually it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand how we each had like a part of the answer and how to put them all together and make the best awesome so to answer out there was "
18118,520.1,Farrah,,,"hi we're doing good thank you for asking "
18122,150.1,Luis,,"so you all read water on the moon right ","well i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18124,150.1,Luis,,"oh that's wonderful to have your background knowledge i just want to make sure that class understands this text this particular text okay by this author ","okay okay "
18131,120.2,Farrah,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well i think that a keyword is equipment because in your answer you need to have like a tool or something "
18140,130.2,Jazmin,,"see if you class got the same answers ","so for my answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong after reading the text again "
18143,430.1,Jazmin,,"all right it's not that your answer is wrong particularly it's not what the question is asking right it's asking what equipment specifically so let's try to use the text and see what the name of that tool is ","And so it says that NASA sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter. "
18145,230.2,Jazmin,,"that's fantastic exactly the more specific we are in the texts can you help me find out where that is which which pairs ","i found it in paragraph two in the in the first sentence "
18150,230.2,Oliver,,,"Well, Farrah, and we had a different answer when we talked about it. we said it was the microscope and they talk about that in the next paragraph how you would need a tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's also equipment "
18155,130.2,Chris,,"class else find any other piece of equipment ","will own i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18157,230.2,Chris,,"wow that's awesome background information is there any evidence in the text that you found that kind of that supports that they use oxygen and hydrogen tanks and etc ","um oh oh well no not in this story but i just know that if there were astronauts they would need all of those things "
18162,110.1,Luis,,"that's a very good point ","yeah okay so i'm thinking what student said it just made me think um i just reread the textbook as you told us to you know it doesn't say anything about astronauts student they don't even have the word astronaut and that story "
18168,120.1,Chris,,"Can you try ","i guess your i can try again because if i have to pick one from the story i would say i go so i would probably say what student said about the lunar orbiter because that sounds that sounds more like like a like a spaceship or something that they would send "
18170,420.2,Chris,," ","it says to investigate and to look for ice deposits "
18173,110.4,Oliver,,"yeah look for ice deposits in a large polar crater yes student ","i'm so sorry i just locked up a lot and we actually have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that our answers needed to have evidence from the text and the more evidence you have a stronger your answer is that's going to help us a lot with us close on also our classes too so thank you so much "
18175,110.4,Farrah,,,"hi it's good to see you today "
18181,110.4,Luis,,,"um yeah well i was gonna say i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer "
18195,120.4,Farrah,,"student can your class tell me what you what your reflection was ","yeah yeah we'd love to go first okay so um well we had the same answer originally so our our our answer for this has kind of the same show on we said "
18205,120.4,Farrah,,,"well what was the first part again i used to i used to think Okay, so we started out thinking that the answer was the microscope but now we think that the answer is the lunar orbiter be because oh well because well it kind of we talked about it and we heard that jazmin's answer was right "
18211,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah student jazmin's answer was right but do you know why that is ","well it's because that they use the lunar lunar orbiter first and that's what they used to discover and then they use the microscope to study "
18218,230.1,Jazmin,,"Let me ask Jazmin. Can you clarify to us Why you chose the lunar orbiter in your revised answer. ","yeah so well my first answer was nasa send a small machine but my new answer is nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and i changed it because there wasn't enough detail so if i just say small machine it could be like anything like a like a toaster or a computer so next time i have a question like this i will look for all the details "
18224,510.1,Farrah,,"she's going back to the text and finding that specific piece of evidence that was used to discover water on the moon ","i'm okay i would say next time i see a question like this i will look for or i'm look for evidence and the text "
18228,120.4,Chris,,"how about a student or student and i haven't heard from you yet what were your takeaways ","can i go "
18230,120.4,Chris,,,"i want to know is my new answer okay my new answer is the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that okay "
18236,210.3,Chris,,"so is that referring to any equipment that the scientists found or used ","nope nope nope nope nope nope student you didn't even say the equipment and that's like the whole point but that's the whole question oh yeah "
18240,230.2,Oliver,,"let me pull up my text which paragraph was that in ","oh this is student i'm really sorry but actually we have to go and i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us think about how we got our answers and why we changed our answers because student and me we had just going to change that because we heard the right answer but now we heard more ideas for for how to find the right answer and the first place so thank you for that "
18245,150.1,Luis,,"we are going to take a few minutes to reflect on our takeaways from our revised answers ","um excuse me i shouldn't be in that scrub i already corrected my answer "
18250,150.1,Luis,,"i just want to hear your takeaways and reflections ","yeah okay "
18258,120.4,Farrah,,"look like we're ready who would like to share your takeaways ","oh we can go first "
18263,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay so well we had the same answer at the start so we we started out thinking that the scientists used a microscope to look really closely at the water and now now we think that the scientists used the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of on frozen water in the craters and we think that because well um so it was like we were told that the microscope wasn't right because they didn't use that first they used the lunar orbiter first but i don't really know how i would have thought of that on my own "
18271,120.3,Oliver,,"can you read what that question is ","yes so so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon Oh yeah I got it. It's discover "
18275,120.3,Oliver,,"student can you read ","all okay um it's it's what equipment to discover "
18277,150.1,Farrah,,"right does that make sense student ","yeah can i try again "
18279,120.1,Farrah,,"try again ","okay so we used to think it was the microscope and now we think it's the lunar orbiter because that's the equipment they used to discover so i guess if i was doing this again maybe i would do what you had to have just do and look back in the question for an action word "
18282,120.4,Chris,,"what about student ","oh okay well i want to know if my new answers okay so my new answer is the water the scientists found on the moon was microscopic "
18285,150.1,Chris,,"alright let's just let's use the same approach we used for student and then answer ","They on they read the question and they found the action work discover "
18289,210.3,Chris,,"discover and let's analyze your answer and see if that really answers the discover part ","so i said the water the scientists found was microscopic so i said like what it looked like when they discovered "
18295,120.1,Chris,,"i see some few shaking their head no huh alright so next strategy you can do is revisit the text ","so so and what should i look for "
18300,130.2,Jazmin,,"okay can you help them out you class what part in ","yes student you want to look for equipment your answer nice to say equipment so it needs to have like a thing like an object in it "
18304,120.1,Oliver,,"And see if you can find something different. ","um excuse me um we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say that the way that you had us talk about why our answer changed on really helped us think about not just how to look at the text but also like how to look at the question and i think that's a really important first step so thank you so much for teaching us that today "
18306,120.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18308,120.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're good thanks for asking "
18311,120.2,Luis,,"so you class answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon does someone want to oh student you have your hand raised you have a question ","excuse me i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
18315,120.2,Luis,,"do you want to go first then student about answering the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
18317,230.2,Luis,,"cool and did you get that information from the reading that we did ","no i just i just knew that because i watch all sorts of stuff about astronauts on like youtube and you know on the internet and stuff "
18321,110.3,Luis,,"right so that's so cool that you have that extra information ","looking at now "
18326,120.4,Farrah,,"student what did you say ","i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18331,210.3,Farrah,,"or do you need more than that ","well they said it's really small so if you don't have the microscope you can't see it "
18342,120.4,Jazmin,,"all right let's see student you have your hand up ","here yeah so i listened to the facts and i still don't understand why my answer is wrong i said that nasa scientists small machine "
18345,420.2,Jazmin,,"right so your answer isn't wrong they did send a small machine but i want to see more detail i know that you could pull more detail from this what was the small machine called do you remember ","i think you just said it it's the lunar orbiter nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter "
18349,120.4,Oliver,,"student what would you like to add to that ","i get that they sent the lunar orbiter but i cricled the same answer as student and and i still don't i don't see why it's not the miscroscope because it sounds like they used that too right "
18351,210.4,Oliver,,"they did so once they actually found the water then they used the microscope to see it so they needed to use a machine first to actually find the water and then they use the microscope to actually look at the water ","it's like first the lunar orbiter goes and that's how they know it's there and then and then use a microscope to like study it "
18353,120.4,Chris,,"exactly i'm student do you have anything to add ","yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18356,210.4,Chris,,"do you know we just read about it you want me to read it again ","i think we know it's um well it's an orbiter so i guess that means like it goes around the moon "
18358,210.4,Chris,,"let's read it again it talks about the lunar orbiter going around the moon and it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater ","was my answer my answer was that the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon "
18360,210.3,Chris,,"right they did and they did that through what equipment ","lunar orbiter i guess "
18364,150.1,Oliver,,"right nice job all right does class else have anything they want to add to this discussion student what do you want to add ","well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our answers and helping us understand the difference between what the lunar orbiter did and what the microscope did that was so helpful and now i understand what to look for in the text so i really appreciate it thank you so much "
18367,150.1,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18369,150.1,Farrah,,,"really good thanks for asking "
18372,150.1,Luis,,"awesome i'm excited to learn some more about water on the moon with you class today ","yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18376,120.4,Farrah,,"with that being said let's talk about all of your answers that you class gave to the question about what equipment did scientists use to discover on the moon who wants to volunteer to go first was what they said for their answer ","okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
18378,230.1,Farrah,,"okay awesome student and what made you say that ","so they talk about the microscope in in part in part three and they say the water is microscopic and so you wouldn't be able to see it if you didn't have a microscope "
18382,120.4,Jazmin,,"who else would like to share that what they said as their answer ","i'm ready i'm ready to go "
18385,120.4,Jazmin,,,"okay so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18387,230.1,Jazmin,,"oh okay so first tell me what made you say that nasa sent a small machine ","well they say that in part two that they sent a small machine "
18390,420.2,Jazmin,,"but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text and add more details to your answer what was this small machine called and what was it there to do ","okay so should i reread it "
18393,120.4,Chris,,"who else wants to share their answer and what they got ","can i go can i go "
18395,120.4,Chris,,,"okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18397,230.1,Chris,,"okay student so what made you what made you choose this answer ","okay well so the text is it's called water on the moon and so i figured the answer should be about the water on the moon and they found it in the craters like these critters full over water "
18400,420.3,Chris,,"what i want you to do now is go back to the text and look for a specific piece of equipment that the scientist used to discover this water on the moon ","Okay, looking for equipment. Gotcha. "
18402,420.3,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm i'm i'm feeling confused i had the same answer as student and i still i don't understand why you told her to look again because i think a microscope it's the correct answer "
18404,230.1,Oliver,,"oh okay so why why do you think the microscope is the correct answer ","well how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
18408,420.3,Oliver,,"Discovering water on the moon and the machine that they use to discover it because if you go back and you read that part, you'll actually find that there's a different machine that they use. So I want you to go back and try and find that machine. ","okay i'll do my best "
18411,120.4,Luis,,"and then student what did you say for your answer ","ah i said you need a scientist need oxygen tanks "
18413,230.1,Luis,,"okay awesome so you said that the scientists need oxygen tanks and what made you say this ","well i mean since i know so much about space i just know that if if you're gonna have people on the moon they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks and really like lots of equipment and stuff "
18417,420.3,Chris,,"so that's awesome but what i want you to do is i want you to go back to the text reread it and look for equipment that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon okay ","yeah well what student said it reminded me that i i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like even said and masks and suits "
18420,110.1,Chris,,"you're right they do use tons of different equipment ","oh like the stuff they say in the story "
18423,110.1,Chris,,,"okay so every night there's like there's two there's two equipments i see this small machine which student was talking about and i see the microscope too "
18427,210.4,Chris,,"oh okay so if you read further which one is used to discover water on the moon ","oh it doesn't really say the word discover but if i had to guess i'd say i probably guessed the orbiter it sounds like that's more of a robot kind of thing that might be able to detect the water "
18430,210.4,Oliver,,"um in that sentence it goes on to describe what this lunar orbiter does can you read through that and then tell me what the lunar orbiter does ","oh i'm really sorry i we have to go but i just wanted to say thank you so much for listening to why we got our answers instead of just like telling us that our answers were wrong that really made us feel like like you really heard every single one of us "
18433,210.4,Farrah,,,"hi "
18435,150.1,Farrah,,"alright so what we're going to talk about now did you all get a chance to read through the text again and maybe come up with some new answers about the machine that was used to discover water on the moon ","yeah we all we all took some time and we read it again "
18438,120.4,Jazmin,,"would class like to share ","yeah i can share "
18441,120.4,Jazmin,,"all right student go ahead ","so you told me to look again and see if i can add more details to my answer and i found more details in part two which is where my answer came from and so i would say nasa scientists machine called a lunar orbiter which will land at the moon south pole and look for is deposits in the craters "
18444,150.1,Jazmin,,"do you understand why i had you do this ","oh no not really i just added more details "
18447,210.3,Jazmin,,"great so do you understand why your answer might have been not complete last time and now it is ","because there was more information that i didn't put in "
18451,120.4,Oliver,,"student ","okay um so i thought the microscope it was the right answer and now well now i know about the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really know how i would have known that i'm without without student telling us "
18453,120.3,Oliver,,"oh interesting okay so what i want you to do is i want you to right now read me the question that we're trying to figure out ","okay um what equipment did scientists use to find water on the moon okay so we're looking for the equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon "
18456,120.1,Oliver,,"okay and when you get to that part please raise your hand and let me know we'll go over together to fit to talk about the equipment that they used okay ","yeah i'll look "
18461,530.1,Chris,,"great does class else want to share their answers and maybe how their answers have changed ","okay well i was i was thinking about a lot of stuff about nasa and the different types of equipment and the craters and stuff but you reminded me that the answer well it has to be equipment and it has to be in the story so i guess if i were to try again i would pick out a piece of equipment on like the lunar orbiter "
18465,120.4,Oliver,,"student did you find anything ","okay so um i think a part that you're talking about is the part in part two where it says about looking for the ice deposits because i guess the water was not just water it was ice and they found it as ice ice form "
18467,120.3,Oliver,,"oh alright can you read that whole sentence to me starting from the beginning ","yeah okay this lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar greater "
18470,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","yeah okay so in the part about where they actually find the water are talking about the small machine "
18473,310.1,Oliver,,"good work paying close attention to the details of our story ","yeah okay i think i'm i think if i if i just read it more carefully next time i maybe i could find the right answer "
18478,110.2,Luis,,"you're right you're so right if there are astronauts on the moon there needs to be oxygen tags ","yeah okay um my answer did not really change like i guess i get i get how you say it has to be in the story and yeah okay they use a lunar orbiter maybe they use a microscope who knows but if there were astronauts there have to be oxygen tanks "
18481,210.3,Luis,,"but what is our question asking us ","okay why did scientist us to discover why "
18483,210.3,Luis,,"Did they use their oxygen tanks to just be like, Okay, I'm gonna throw this oxygen tank at the moon's so that it discovered water. ","okay well well they were using the oxygen tank star for you "
18487,230.3,Luis,,"right so they're using the oxygen tanks to breathe breathe but then they're using a different piece of equipment to actually discover the water on the moon ","yeah yeah yeah i see what you mean now "
18490,230.3,Oliver,,,"um well it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say that the way you asked us to think about how our answer changed like what we used to think and now what we think that really helped me at least understand how i could go from a wrong answer to to a more a more right answer i think i'm going to use that next time too so thank you so much "
18494,230.3,Farrah,,,"hello hi it's good to see you i'm unable to see and hear you at this moment i think you might have frozen can you repeat what you said you had frozen "
18496,230.3,Farrah,,,"that's okay "
18499,230.3,Luis,,"so i see that some of us have said that scientists use lots of equipment yes student ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18501,150.1,Luis,,"okay well we're just going to talk a little bit more ","okay i love talking about space "
18506,210.3,Farrah,,"and that's one part of it do you remember any other parts from the reading ","well i read it i read the whole thing but that was the piece of equipment that i thought because a microscope is like a tool "
18509,110.1,Farrah,,"yeah microscope is like a tool ","and so that's why i thought it was the answer because in the text oh i remember one thing i remember is isn't the water is really small it's so small it's microscopic and that's why you need the microscope to see it i remember that "
18513,130.2,Jazmin,,"so looking at the reading there's another machine that the scientists use did class remember what that other machine that they used ","well i said that nasa sent a small machine "
18515,210.3,Jazmin,,"do you remember what it was called ","it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
18518,130.2,Jazmin,,"who remembers what the lunar orbiter looks for ","um well i think it looks for the for the water "
18521,110.1,Chris,,"yeah ","was my answer that's what i said that the scientists found craters full of water "
18523,210.4,Luis,,"Or like, What state was this water found in? ","oh i know the answer to this one i know "
18525,120.4,Luis,,"what is it student ","if ice it was ice "
18528,210.4,Farrah,,"how is the water on the moon different from the water on the earth where you might find like giant lakes full of water ","i got that there was the lunar orbiter and stuff but i still don't understand why my answer was wrong "
18531,130.3,Farrah,,"you just needed a little bit more so in addition to using a microscope they also use the machine called the lunar orbiter ","oh ok so it's both "
18533,110.1,Farrah,,"exactly ","okay "
18535,110.1,Farrah,,,"did they use them did they use the microscope to on to see the water because i feel like i feel like you have to see it before you can discover it and that was the word and the question discover but i feel like you have to see it first "
18540,210.4,Farrah,,"so when you think of microscopic what are you reminded of that you've seen before ","oh like so tiny you can't even see it "
18543,210.4,Oliver,,"Are we thinking about, like, huge craters filled with water. ","i heard what student said but i don't think he was right i think i think it was awesome student said full of water but i think it's so small cause i also said a microscope like student "
18548,230.1,Chris,,"student when you've said that you found craters full of water how big do you think the craters were ","they were pretty big because they're on the moon and stuff and and i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18554,150.1,Chris,,"Does that make sense. ","yeah so i guess i was picturing like all this water but really it was just like like a little little ice deposits exactly okay that's different than what i thought in my mind Yeah. makes a lot of sense "
18556,230.3,Jazmin,,"student so you said nasa sent like a small machine ","yes a small machine "
18558,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah so what would you need a small machine for what did they use it for ","what it says then you start to investigate that's the word they use in paragraph two "
18560,230.1,Jazmin,,"so they used it to investigate what makes you think that it's small ","just because they use that word in the sentence they say they say nasa sent a small machine so i was just i was using that word because it was in the story "
18564,150.1,Jazmin,,"is that makes sense ","it's called it's an orbiter and that makes me think that it like it goes in orbit like like it's kind of goes around the moon because we learned in science that that's what it means "
18569,110.1,Oliver,,"exactly ","excuse me yes i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming here today and for helping us talk through all of our answers because like you said sometimes we have to talk about it to help us kind of like think about what we were thinking in our head and hear what other people were thinking in their head and so it was really helpful just to talk about our answers with you today "
18571,110.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
18573,210.1,Farrah,,"okay so i put all of us into this class because class here has a partial answer does class know what a partial answer means ","well this is just a guess but it sounds like maybe it's like you have part of it but not all of it "
18576,310.1,Luis,,"yeah i like how you use part of the word partial to break it down into something that you already knew ","um yeah well i should be being in this class i already know all about space "
18585,150.1,Luis,,"does class understand these instructions ","yeah i think so so we're talking and sharing and then rereading to find our partners answers "
18587,210.3,Luis,,"yes and in addition to finding your partner's answer you're going to also look for things that you would add to their answer ","oh yeah okay "
18591,120.4,Farrah,,"let's start with your answer so what did what was oliver's answer ","okay student said well we actually had the same answer which was that it was the microscope that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope "
18593,210.3,Farrah,,"i see and as you're reading is there anything that you think you might want to add to that ","oh well no not really i mean we have the same answer and i guess i still don't understand why that answers wrong "
18595,210.4,Farrah,,"okay that's fine let's look a little bit closer at the reading so i'm going to direct you to one part of the paragraph not the paragraph the the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find okay ","sure "
18602,210.4,Farrah,,"okay that's fine let's look a little bit closer at the reading so i'm going to direct you to one part of the exerpt and then we're gonna look at it together and see what we can find in the second paragraph what's the main thing it talks about ","well i guess it talks about how the lunar orbiter was looking for ice and how there's not that much of it like it's really small "
18605,410.3,Oliver,,"I'm what I would like you to see, though, is a little bit more than just how much water there is but also what was looking for the water ","Okay, yeah. You want both of us to look at that again and I will look up part two for more tools. "
18610,110.1,Luis,,"and then i'm gonna get back to you ","uh huh yeah we were working all together the three of us "
18612,110.1,Luis,,,"okay i looked at on jazmin's answer and she said that nasa sent a small machine "
18614,210.3,Luis,,"okay and as you're reading what are you able to see in the reading that you might want to add ","well i was thinking that like we could add some other equipment like oxygen tanks because that was my answer and i'm student was talking about how he wants to nasa and so he knows that there's like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff "
18619,410.3,Luis,,"so even though we know that they use things like oxygen tanks that's not specifically in the reading ","Oh ok ok so cuz it's because it's not in the story. That's why it's not a whole answer. "
18621,110.4,Luis,,"exactly ","oh ok i see that make sense "
18625,420.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so go ahead and keep reading and see if you can find what details are in the reading that might answer this question ","okay well i looked at chris's answer he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and i think that's not quite a whole answer because he doesn't actually say anything about equipment "
18628,210.3,Oliver,,"i can see how you're starting to put together what we're talking about here about partial answers and why sometimes we need to just add a little bit more to them ","yeah actually i wanted to just say it's time for the next class but thank you so much because you really hope to think about what makes a partial answer and the fact that we could keep on going back to the text and look for more to make our answer more complete "
18634,150.1,Jazmin,,"so student you were looking at chris's answer ","student student and he said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18636,230.2,Jazmin,,"and when you're reading through what makes you where do you think that came from in the reading ","oh well i wasn't quite sure because when i was looking at it it sounded to me like it was just a little bit of water but maybe he was thinking about the craters like in part one it says craters "
18638,120.4,Luis,,"yeah student what's up ","yeah i just have something to say and that's i just wanted to remind you and also you do that my dad is actually an astronaut "
18640,110.1,Luis,,"wow that's very interesting even but i'd really like you to focus on the article right now and then you can tell me more about that later ","okay "
18646,420.2,Jazmin,,"So go ahead and look into the reading and see what you might add to the answer to make it from a partial answer to a complete answer and then I'll come right back to you. ","oh ok "
18649,150.1,Chris,,"i think the last one so you were looking at luis's answer right ","he looked at luis's answer and he was talking about the oxygen tanks and stuff but it sounds like that's not really the right answer "
18651,230.2,Chris,,"so as you're reading where do you think student got the answer of the oxygen tanks ","yeah well so here's the thing so we were talking about it because we both know about space but then when i looked at the at the story again it didn't actually say anything about oxygen tanks or even like astronauts really "
18656,210.2,Chris,,"but when we're looking at our question this one is asking for us to see in the text what tools were used what exactly did nasa use ","right yeah so that was more like jazmin's answer cuz she said the small machine Oh well. Okay. Hello, like it says that the lunar orbiter will land up the South Pole and look for ice deposits. So maybe we could say the lunar orbiter looked for ice deposits. "
18660,150.1,Chris,,"i'm going to go back over to student and savannas class so keep working ","okay okay "
18662,120.4,Oliver,,"so student and student what did you find when you were reading ","okay well um before we have said down microscope and i think we still bought kind of think about microscope might be right but there was one other tool and that was the lunar orbiter "
18665,230.2,Oliver,,"oh where did you find that in the text ","to paragraph two like the first sentence of it "
18671,230.2,Oliver,,"you found your first answer in paragraph three correct ","yeah paragraph 3 is about the microscope "
18673,420.3,Oliver,,"Look again and try again and see if you if it's actually talking about a microscope or if it's talking about something a little different. ","okay so reread part three yeah okay got it "
18675,120.4,Farrah,,"and student were you getting the same things as student since you're working together ","yeah we found those two pieces of equipment yeah the lunar orbiter and the microscope and it also talked about a cup like measuring the water "
18679,420.3,Farrah,,"for you student what i want you to do is try looking at paragraph two and see what they're talking about when they're talking about the cup and maybe why they mentioned that ","okay i'll look at that "
18685,230.2,Luis,,"since we've looked at jazmin's answer and luis's answer let's look a little closer at chris's answer so what did you all find when you were reading again and reading closely to see where student got his answer and what you might student yeah ","okay so um i don't know where student got his answer because if you read the story it's pretty clear that there weren't any craters full of water or anything it just says they were there was water like deep in the craters and so i would fix chris's answer i would say um that the scientists they found only a little bit of water and it was actually ice and they found it in the craters with on the lunar orbiter "
18691,210.4,Oliver,,"what comes into your head when you think of craters ","oh god i'm so sorry to have to say that i looked at the clock and we really have to go on a launch now but i went on to say this was so helpful because you helped us on think about like how to keep thinking about our answer and keep going back and see why is this the best answer or why is something else the best answer and so by looking at the text again and asking ourselves questions that's going to help us make sure we have a fall and not a partial answer "
18693,210.4,Farrah,,,"hi good afternoon "
18696,150.1,Farrah,,"how did we enjoy that text the water on the moon ","oh it was so cool "
18699,150.1,Luis,,"i'm glad you liked it does class want to share anything important that they read ","well excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18703,120.2,Jazmin,,"for class so feel free to answer and the question will be what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and use the information that you learn from in the text ","nasa sent a small machine "
18705,210.4,Jazmin,,"good did they give a name for what the machine was called ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
18708,310.1,Chris,,"good i like that you went back in the text and dug a little deeper to see if there was more information good job ","i'll share can i share "
18710,310.1,Chris,,,"yeah well "
18714,310.1,Chris,,,"scientists found craters full of water on the moon They're like big on the kind of hard to describe. But it's like it's like a whole but with a bottom and it's above ground instead of underground. I don't know. They're hard to describe. "
18716,210.4,Chris,,"yeah i'm looking in the text now and i see that it describes craters as dark places where the sun never shines ","oh yeah that's a good description too "
18720,110.1,Farrah,,"thank you who else would like to share what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18726,210.4,Oliver,,"So if we look back in our text. Maybe someone can read from the text. If you have it handy line that would indicate what equipment was used for science to discover water on the moon. ","okay well actually i had the same answer i student and so i found out in paragraph three and if you look there and says the water they found as microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you are looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope so i think that's what they use because you have to see something if you are going to find it "
18731,120.1,Oliver,,"what do we think they used ","To investigate. Let me look for that water in the story well it says investigate in part two "
18734,230.3,Oliver,,"yeah and member student had said that they sent a small machine to investigate ","So you're saying like they use thought the lunar orbiter first. After that, on the astronauts to use the microscope, just see it. "
18737,130.2,Chris,,"that's what i think does class agree ","yo well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
18744,110.2,Luis,,"these are all pieces of equipment that scientists might need if they're doing investigations that's a great point student ","yeah i actually i do because i know but the word orbit means like vehicles around something and so i'm thinking maybe that that there weren't asked astronaut spec has it doesn't even say the word astronaut anywhere in the story so like if there weren't even astronauts they wouldn't really need a microscope the astronauts walking around the whole moon holding a little microscope but that's kind of funny to think about "
18750,150.1,Chris,,"so i like that we were thinking did class else want to add something ","maybe they'll send astronauts back after "
18752,150.1,Chris,,,"get the water "
18757,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah maybe i guess we'll have to wait and see right yes student ","um well i just looked up a clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just want to say thank you so much for helping us understand how they use the different equipment and to look for that word investigate to find the best piece of equipment for the for a question but also knowing how they use like all the other kinds of equipment that we had also said and that really helped us feel like our answers where we're good an important one also know what the right answer was so thank you so much "
18760,110.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you "
18763,120.4,Luis,,"student do you have a question ","um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18767,210.2,Luis,,"so for this question it says what equipment do we know what equipment means ","yeah yeah equipment like the stuff he used to do something "
18771,210.2,Luis,,"yeah equipment is kind of like a tool so they're asking what tool scientists used to discover water on the moon ","well it's like um maybe i mean they might not use the oxygen tanks to discover the water but they would need to have oxygen tanks on if there were astronauts there because otherwise they couldn't even get to discovering the water because they wouldn't have any oxygen and they wouldn't be alive and they couldn't discover the water "
18776,130.1,Luis,,"So I don't think it would be oxygen tanks. I do think those would be helpful. But I don't think that that is exactly what the scientists used to discover the water ","Um, yeah, okay, I'll read it. Yeah. "
18781,110.2,Jazmin,,"great response ","thank you yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
18784,420.3,Jazmin,,"so i think it would also be helpful for you to go back into the text and look and see if you can find any more details about that small machine that they named in our text ","okay "
18786,230.3,Farrah,,"now let's see let's see i'm student i really liked how you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","yeah i knew i was looking for equipment and so that's why i found the microscope "
18789,210.3,Farrah,,"yeah and that's a great microscope helped us to look at the water but do you think it helped us to discover that water ","well i mean how could you discover something if it's too small to see you have to be able to see to find it "
18794,210.4,Farrah,,"before they even got to look at the water they needed a sense of if there was water and so they sent something on to the moon to help them discover that water ","you want me to read it again or well i mean i heard student talk about the small machine and stuff "
18798,210.4,Chris,,"so the first thing that the scientists did was investigate they needed to investigate the moon before they could even go in and see anything else ","Yeah, okay. So I went to NASA. So I know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks, but also masks and suits. "
18801,130.2,Chris,,"yes that's a very good point as well student and can someone remind me do we see in the text anywhere that there was any astronauts sent to the moon does class remember ","oh i don't think it's the word astronaut like and me were "
18805,410.2,Chris,,"but the text doesn't say that they sent any astronauts to the moon to find the water ","Oh, okay. So it was like, Oh, it was an unmanned craft. Oh, I learned that word at NASA to "
18809,120.4,Jazmin,,"go ahead student ","okay so you said i have to look for more detail and so i found about this machine a few things so first it said that it was called the lunar orbiter and then also it said it looked for the ice deposits and the craters "
18812,310.1,Oliver,,"good i like that you went back into the text and you found specific details to share with us ","on so it's our it's time for us to goal right now but i wanted to say thank you for paying attention to each one of our answers and giving each one of us something specific to think about and talk about that really made us feel like you heard us and could help each and every one of us "
18815,310.1,Farrah,,,"oh we're good today how are you "
18817,120.2,Luis,,"good thank you i see that you class have just answered your question your you just answered the question about the text that we read about water on the moon yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18819,110.3,Luis,,"wow to know all about space you must know a lot ","i do "
18827,120.2,Luis,,"the question was what equipment did scientists use to discover the moon the water on the moon ","Okay, yeah, I'll read it. "
18831,210.3,Jazmin,,"do you notice anything else about the equipment that they mentioned ","like about the machine or about other equipment "
18833,230.1,Jazmin,,"so you said that they had sent a small machine did you mean that this small machine helped to discover the water on the moon ","yes yeah so that was my answer yeah "
18837,210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so that's a great answer but i'm wondering if you can give me any more details for that ","Yeah. so yeah so i found it in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it will land at the mood south pole and look for ice deposits and the polar crate "
18843,210.3,Jazmin,,"looking at that question now and looking at what you just read we read in the text do you think that there's a way that you could improve upon your answer ","well i guess i could put more more like from the text so i could add like the name and how it works "
18845,210.3,Farrah,,,"hi um i don't understand why my answers wrong "
18847,230.1,Farrah,,"okay let's take a look at your answer so you said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and student can you just clarify for me when you said you'd need a microscope to look really closely what do you mean what are they looking closely at ","so they're looking closely to find the water because it says that it's microscopic the water is so they're looking at the the really small water with the microscope "
18851,210.4,Farrah,,"or do you think that they need some sort of machine to discover the water ","is this about like how there's no astronauts so they need a machine "
18853,210.4,Farrah,,"well so if we refer back to the text i do see your point about them needing a microscope in order to see the water but before they get a microscope they use some sort of other equipment ","student was talking about that machine that looked in the craters "
18860,210.4,Oliver,,"So we know that they needed the microscope to analyze it and to better see it but they needed something to help them  Understand if they're even was water on the moon. ","um yeah okay i think i can help student out because remember how like if there aren't astronauts then who would even be holding the microscope because like i picked that same answer to but now i see that like yeah you said you can't just send a microscope to the moon you have done something first "
18863,210.4,Oliver,,"no no so what did they send ","um so it has to be that lunar orbiter yeah i thought i was the microscope to student but now i changed my mind "
18869,210.4,Oliver,,"but first we needed to even understand if there was water on the moon and so that machine that lunar orbiter that we talked about helped us to understand if there was water on the moon ","oh it's time for us to go to lunch i'm so sorry this was really fun class but i just wanted to say on before we go thank you so much because you helped us see whether our answers actually connected to the question arm and that's why i changed my answer because i realized it didn't actually answer the question thank you so much for helping i see that "
18872,210.4,Farrah,,,"good morning "
18874,210.4,Farrah,,,"it's nice to meet you "
18877,150.1,Farrah,,"i want to go over a couple of things so did we just read an article ","about about water on the moon "
18881,230.1,Luis,,"can you add any other details ","well excuse me this is student i should i and i already know all about space "
18885,110.1,Farrah,,"teacher okay student i want to hear what you have to say it's so important but i was still asking student if she could build to her answer because i want to know if there's more to the article than just water on the moon ","well it was also about the fact that the moon is a desert and the different the tool that they had to use when they found the water "
18887,110.1,Farrah,,,"and my answer was the microscope that they use the microscope "
18890,120.4,Luis,,"so student agrees student agrees good student can you share what you were gonna share earlier thank you for waiting ","well i was just saying i shouldn't be in this class because i already know all about space "
18895,110.3,Luis,,"maybe that you can teach the rest of us about ","oh i know a lot about space because i watch all sorts of youtube videos about rockets and all of the planets and stuff and so for the question i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and they have to have the whole of rocket ship and everything that they need to prepare for that oh it's so cool to watch rocket launches and to learn about all the astronauts i just i really love space "
18905,120.2,Jazmin,,"the discussion question again what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yes so i saw that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18912,230.2,Jazmin,,"what did you read ","i read paragraph two where it says nasa nasa nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i said a small machine "
18916,420.3,Farrah,,"When we read an article, I want to make sure that you read through the whole thing and try to pull out pieces from the article for that discussion question. ","yes it's right here on our tablets "
18920,120.4,Chris,,"student you have a question ","or you went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff "
18928,210.3,Oliver,,"So let's take the next two minutes to read through the article, you can have your previous answers. I love just add to them and then we'll talk about it. ","i just looked at the clock and we have to lunch now i'm really sorry because this cost was really fun but i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us that we really have to use the words that are in front of us and the story in front of us and and not just all the things that we already know like like student and student but we also have to use that story and use what it tells us when we answer the question that was really really helpful thank you so much "
18931,210.3,Farrah,,,"hi good morning "
18933,210.3,Farrah,,,"oh great how are you "
18936,120.3,Luis,,"so you just answered a question about i'm not exactly sure what it was with someone like to raise their hand and tell me what you just read and what you just answered student ","okay yeah so um we answered the question about the equipment and the water on the moon but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
18938,120.3,Farrah,,"oh i love to hear what you know about space right now i want to focus on the question that we had to ask what was it exactly do you have the text in front of you maybe someone can read it from their book from their icon ","okay so the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
18941,120.4,Luis,,"student what was your answer to that question ","um i said i'm that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
18944,110.1,Jazmin,,"awesome thank you for sharing ","okay i said nasa sent a small machine "
18947,120.4,Chris,,"student what was your answer ","and my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
18950,110.1,Oliver,,"wow thank you for sharing ","so i circled the same as student and we both thought it was the microscope "
18952,230.1,Oliver,,"so thank you for sharing i'm happy that you work with student did you get any answer independently ","oh yeah i mean i mean we both just thought if the same answer i mean so i thought the microscope and she thought our microscope um yeah "
18955,110.1,Farrah,,"i'm happy that you were able to learn from each other ","um well my my full answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
18959,150.1,Oliver,,"that's so important because what does that tell me ","well some of us are right and some of us are wrong "
18962,130.2,Jazmin,,"oh ok i can see why you think that but i don't see it that way does class else have an idea why do we all have different answers ","maybe up there's more than one answer "
18966,150.1,Jazmin,,"why there are different tools and different equipment to help scientists to make different discoveries ","yeah okay that sounds good "
18980,150.1,Jazmin,,"for number one the first task you have two minutes and for number two the second task you have two minutes okay ","we know who our partners i think we're ready to go "
18987,130.2,Jazmin,,"student in student then work together ","okay okay "
18989,150.1,Farrah,,"any questions ","i think we're ready i think we're ready to go "
18991,150.1,Farrah,,,"on we we can move on but i promise the right people are working together "
18994,150.1,Farrah,,"let me know if you have any questions ","you said it was my turn first "
18998,110.1,Farrah,,"that your answer reads you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","yeah exactly "
19001,230.2,Farrah,,"yes exactly where you found it ","yes i found it in in paragraph three on it some where they talk about how the waters microscopic "
19004,120.3,Farrah,,"i can see this is that you're talking about the water they found is microscopic can you continue reading that paragraph ","okay um so the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19008,230.2,Farrah,,"was that a big clue for you ","yeah exactly i know that a microscope is a tool "
19011,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome thank you for sharing i want you ","teacher "
19014,110.1,Farrah,,"Yes, one second. And I will be so happy to hear. Let me just finish up with Farrah first. ","Okay, read and look for a signal. "
19016,420.3,Oliver,,"yes so reread paragraphs one and two and look for other clues that have a hint towards scientific equipment okay and it's okay for you to circle some words that might help ","um yeah i'm really sorry but it's time for us to go actually um but i wanted to say i wish we'd all gotten to work with you and hear your your individual on comments cuz it sounded like you had a really good idea of how to help student "
19020,420.3,Farrah,,,"oh hi miss teacher we're back "
19022,420.3,Farrah,,,"great we're excited to keep going "
19024,150.1,Farrah,,"okay so we're going to continue right where we left off student did you go back to your texts and reread paragraphs one and two ","yes i did "
19026,150.1,Farrah,,"okay are you ready to share what you got what the new partner ","well i didn't work with a partner yet i just rewrote it and i found that they talked about a machine "
19028,130.2,Luis,,"awesome so you're going to share what you found with student and i'm going to work with student independently student you have a question okay ","yeah i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
19030,110.3,Luis,,"so interesting maybe you can use some of your background knowledge to add to your answer ","yeah i can do that "
19034,150.1,Oliver,,"are there any questions ","no i think that sounds good "
19036,120.4,Oliver,,"student can you read to me what your answer was to number one ","yeah um so my answer is the microscope "
19038,230.1,Oliver,,"why is that your answer ","okay well um it said a piece of equipment and a microscope is equipment and you need it to look at the water "
19044,150.1,Oliver,,"are you able to add to your answer ","not yet i'm i right now i mean i know what the microscope is a tool "
19046,210.3,Oliver,,"do you think that there are more or different kinds of tools that scientists use on the moon ","um yeah um there's definitely other things like i was working with student and he has had his answer was the oxygen tanks "
19048,210.3,Oliver,,"so did your original answer change in any way after working with student ","no no because um i don't really think the oxygen tanks have anything to do with discovering water "
19050,230.1,Oliver,,"okay and why not ","well you don't use them for discovering you just use them for breathing "
19052,120.3,Oliver,,"can you reread the question to me ","yeah on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the mound "
19055,210.4,Oliver,,"i want you to think of how what is the processes that scientists go through to get to the moon ","oh what were you saying "
19059,210.4,Oliver,,"and think of what different kinds of tools he uses ","okay you want me to take some time and think about it or just try to tell you right now "
19062,420.3,Chris,,"you can brainstorm independently and then go back to text paragraphs one and paragraph two ","Isn't my turn. "
19064,420.3,Chris,,,"student oh sorry student i figured i was next "
19066,110.1,Chris,,"student i'm going to work with you independently in one minute okay ","okay "
19070,120.4,Chris,,"well let me just review do you want to share something ","sure so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and that connects to what student was just talking about so i wanted to share it "
19072,150.1,Luis,,"Thank you for asking. Luis. Then I'm going to work with you. ","sweet "
19074,130.2,Luis,,"student you can go with who doesn't have a partner right now ","oh it must be it must be student "
19076,130.2,Luis,,"student and student should be working together ","oh so it's student and so i don't know "
19078,120.4,Luis,,"okay student i'll work with you independently student what was your answer to the question ","okay it was um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
19080,230.1,Luis,,"excellent and what did you did you work with your partner just now ","um yeah it was student he said he thought my answer was wrong but i definitely don't agree "
19082,230.1,Luis,,"why not ","well if there's astronauts on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
19085,120.4,Luis,,"student have a different tool that he found ","yeah the microscope "
19087,130.2,Luis,,"you agree with that ","um now i mean maybe they used it but it sounded more like it was kind of like after after they found the water than they had to like study it but um i think that that oxygen tanks are probably more important okay "
19089,120.3,Luis,,"can you reread the question to me ","yeah what equipment did scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
19098,420.3,Oliver,,"and find different tools that scientists use you can circle hints or i guess i can help you ","oh yeah nice teacher i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but um i wanted to say having us and listen to each other's answers was really interesting because like you said it sounds like there's a lot of different tools the astronauts use it was really fun to hear all about them "
19102,420.3,Farrah,,,"hi hi nice to see you "
19105,120.4,Luis,,"teacher student can you tell me what you what you thought ","i'm excuse me excuse me this is student "
19111,110.3,Luis,,"okay i know it's awesome that you know so much about space and you do you really do know a lot about space ","um yeah we've all bought it on our tablets "
19115,120.2,Luis,,"what you think is the piece of technology that we use that the scientists used to find ","oh okay "
19117,120.1,Farrah,,"water okay so i'm going to give you one minute to reread or five minutes to read the text ","i think we're all ready "
19120,120.1,Farrah,,,"well i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19126,130.2,Jazmin,,"did class have a different answer than student ","oh i'm sorry i was raising my hand "
19129,130.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah cuz i have a different answer from student and i said that nasa sent a small machine "
19131,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah i'm nasa did send a small machine do you remember what that small machine was called ","oh "
19133,210.4,Jazmin,,"can you go back and yeah maybe if you finish that sentence you might be able to bring us to the right answer can you read that out loud for us where ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
19136,210.4,Chris,,"that was what was used so that they could discover the water when they wanted to observe the water further that was when like student said they used a microscope but when we go back and read the text it was the lunar orbiter that was used to to discover that water yes student ","when i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19141,150.1,Oliver,,"does class understand that can you give me a thumbs up or raise your hand if you if that is making sense ","i'm still a little confused actually "
19143,230.1,Oliver,,"okay what are you ","um i understand what you're saying cause the lunar orbiter sounds like it's still right answer but i had the same answer also student and i guess i'm just not sure like how i would know that my answer is wrong without without you telling us it's the lunar orbiter "
19148,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense when you go back and look at the question that was asked ","oh yeah well i was thinking like how could you find something if you couldn't see it but i i got that maybe you have to find it first and then you can observe it "
19152,150.1,Oliver,,"or need more clarification ","i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch actually but i just wanted to say thank you so much for coming today and for helping us understand why i'm the lunar orbiter was the best to answer for the question um so thank you so much "
19156,150.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi it's good to see you we're we're all doing well "
19160,120.2,Luis,,"so i saw that we had the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group, I already know all about space. "
19167,120.2,Jazmin,,"Okay, so can we look back in the text. I'm at the question that was asked, it was what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. ","well i think the action word is discover "
19176,120.4,Farrah,,"what do you think student ","okay so i'm sorry alright so i think that thought well so i couldn't find the word discover in the story but i think that in order to discover the water that you'd need to find you need the microscope because how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
19179,420.3,Farrah,,"oh student you're absolutely right the word discover isn't here but i want you to look actually i'm going to give you another minute to look back in the text for a word that is a synonym for discover ","Okay. "
19184,120.3,Jazmin,,"okay class looked back and paragraph two ","well so the word that's kind of like discover is investigate and i found my answer in the same sentence as that word i said nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19189,210.4,Luis,,"who can tell me the name of the small machine that nasa sent to investigate ","yep yep i totally got this one it is the lunar orbiter student that's right there and the story i can't believe you didn't get the name that's all right there "
19197,420.1,Chris,,"but friends if we pay attention to the keywords in our question we can really think more critically about how we're going to answer that question and we can go back in the text and try to find words keywords that stand out to us ","yeah oh hi i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19204,210.4,Oliver,,"because we might think it could be the microscope because that's another equipment that's thrown into the text right but that equipment was used only after the water was discovered ","Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer. "
19207,210.4,Farrah,,,"we're good thank you for asking "
19210,120.2,Luis,,"the question was is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable um so i want yes student ","um i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
19221,120.4,Chris,,"since we first answered the question so class have any new ideas student what do you think ","okay so look for the word valuable okay and i only found it in one spot at the very beginning where it says water on the moon would be a valuable resource so it sounds like the answer is yes "
19226,210.2,Oliver,,"what does evidence mean ","evidence is like something from the story the part of the story that you bought your answer from "
19229,420.3,Jazmin,,"That we're looking for evidence is to go back in the text in look for examples, the texts will be giving us examples of why water is a valuable resource. So if we read on, we can find examples within the text or evidence so that we can answer this question More completely into the best of our ability. ","well i got a new idea when i read it for the second time and so my new idea is that you can use water to grow things so we could have a garden on the womb "
19239,120.4,Luis,,"when you have an example raise your hand student what's your example ","my example as water can be broken down into two parts oxygen and hydrogen "
19243,230.1,Luis,,"okay why does that make it a valuable resource that's exactly true that it can be broken down into two parts but if we read on and we get the complete idea if we finish the the thought in the text and we keep reading we may learn why that's important why does that make it valuable ","um okay yeah so um it's valuable because i'm so it can be broken down into hydrogen oxygen and then oh um okay so astronauts could breed the oxygen i mean of course and then oh oh this part is so cool okay oxygen hydrogen could be used for rocket for your wall "
19247,130.2,Farrah,,"does class did class else find other examples student ","oh okay so i was thinking something a little different and it's still from the text there's still evidence so it says that making this plan will take a lot of time and money so i think that it wouldn't be valuable for a long time "
19252,130.2,Oliver,,"student gave an example student do you have an example of why water is valuable for for astronauts ","well i was thinking about another meaning of the word value like i'm like money and it talks about money and it says it would take a lot of money so i was thinking it's not valuable because it takes too much money "
19260,120.2,Oliver,,"of convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","i wish we had time to hear another answer but actually we have to go to lunch but this is a really fun class i don't want to end what thank you because you really helped us think about using evidence evidence from the text in order to answer the question and also you helped us know how to make a complete answer like if you read a little further sometimes and you add more detail your answer can be better and make a lot more sense "
19263,120.2,Farrah,,,"good morning good morning "
19265,120.2,Farrah,,,"oh well you're good thank you for asking "
19269,220.1,Luis,,"does class know what i mean by using evidence from the text ","what excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19271,150.1,Luis,,"so right if you know things about space but there's always more that we can learn it's not that you don't know things about space as to why you're in this class because we can have a better understanding ","oh ok ok ok that makes sense "
19273,210.3,Luis,,"student would you like to answer my question of how we can use everything from the tech to support our answers ","so does that mean like i'm like you have to use a word from the story "
19276,110.4,Luis,,"you're off to a good start like how you said he's a word from the story ","Oh, okay. That makes sense. Yeah. "
19280,120.4,Farrah,,"would class like to share out the answer as to what they believe scientists used to discover water on the moon ","i said scientists used a microscope to look really closely "
19283,230.2,Farrah,,"i like the way you're thinking can you explain why or anywhere in the article where you've seen that a microscope was used ","yeah so it's on paragraph paragraph three it says scientists need a scientific tool called a microscope because the water the water is so small "
19287,110.1,Jazmin,,"thank you student appreciate that thank you so much ","i said that that's the scientists nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19294,210.3,Jazmin,,"so you said a small machine but what some machine would you be talking about ","yeah yeah um so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
19298,130.2,Oliver,,"would class else like to add on student student or student to the first question ","um yeah it's student and i i have the same answer as student also found out about the microscope and so is it a microscope or or is it one machine called the lunar orbiter which one is it "
19302,130.3,Oliver,,"the correct answer is a lunar orbiter ","well a microscope is a tool like equipment like it says in the question "
19305,130.3,Oliver,,,"oh yeah so i have the same answer student and i thought it was the microscope so oh but you said also lunar orbiter and i'm i don't know why it doesn't microscope because microscope is also equipment "
19308,210.4,Chris,,"okay yes i'm sorry it is a microscope is used to view things that are small so being that water i'm the components of water so small you need a microscope to see ","well i'm point to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19315,210.4,Chris,,"But to identify the water they use a microscope ","okay so since since story didn't talk about those things then it's not the right answer Home. Okay. Okay. "
19319,210.4,Oliver,,,"on what actually are two o'clock and we left a good lunch what i wanted to say thank you for really reminding us that we had to use evidence from the text that was so helpful and i know it's going to help us with all our questions in the future so thank you for reminding us and being so patient with us today "
19322,210.4,Farrah,,,"hi it's good to see you "
19326,120.4,Luis,,"i know that you all have burning answer an average if i to go over with you are student do you have a question ","yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19334,420.1,Farrah,,"so what words should we really pay attention to when trying to answer that question ","okay so i think that you should focus on the word equipment because that tells you that the answer it has to be like a thing or a tool "
19338,130.2,Chris,,"does class else have an answer that they would like to contribute ","okay so i picked a different word and i thought that the most important word was water because that is really what the story is about water on the moon "
19340,210.4,Chris,,"and what about water on the moon what's going on with this water ","so there are these craters full of water on the moon and the scientists discovered it because they used to think there wasn't water but now they know that there is "
19346,120.4,Jazmin,,"so who would like to share what their response was to that question student ","okay my answer is that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19351,420.2,Jazmin,,"you were on to the right path of getting to the answer that nasa sent a small machine they did but can you tell me more about the machine can you be more specific while using evidence from the text something to support your answer what type of machine was it ","okay i can try okay so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and it lands at the moon south pole and it looks for the ice deposits in the craters "
19355,120.4,Farrah,,"would class else like to raise your hand and share what they answered for that question ","okay um my answer was different from jazmin's i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19357,230.2,Farrah,,"and student would you mind talking about how did you get that answer what in the text caused you to answer that ","so there's this part on part three and it says the water is microscopic so how can you discover something microscopic if you can't see it that's why i thought you'd need the microscope "
19364,150.1,Farrah,,"do you understand ","yeah okay that makes more sense okay "
19366,110.1,Chris,,"thank you student for sure student ","so i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19369,120.4,Chris,,"yes is that what you answer for the question student ","oh no but we were just talking about the equipment and so that made me think of that and i thought probably they would have to use those things too don't you think "
19371,130.1,Oliver,,"So yes, that equipment can be been gone to the moon. And in the process, but that's not the exact equipment that is used to discover the water, Oliver. ","i'm i'm really sorry but we have to go i wanted to say before we go thank you for really helping us understand the question and the question was about the word discover because that helped us well at least that helped me really understand what the best to answer was "
19374,130.1,Farrah,,,"hello again "
19377,120.2,Luis,,"so i like to go over question number two with you class it we is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","Um, I just wanted to remind you, my dad and actually an astronaut. "
19384,420.1,Jazmin,,"What is some important words that we need to pay attention to in the question or important part to this sentence. ","okay i would say an important part of the question is the word evidence "
19386,230.1,Jazmin,,"and why do you think that's an important part of the question ","well i think it means that you can't just like think of something on your own but you have to read what's in the story "
19390,430.2,Oliver,,"we don't just want to say yes water on the moon is valuable you want to use the text for our answers ","I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer. They won't be convinced. "
19394,110.1,Farrah,,"that's also a good point thank you student yes convincing evidence thank you for that ","is it valuable "
19396,230.1,Farrah,,"why do you think valuable tell me more please ","i think we need to come up with reasons why the water would be like important that's another meaning for valuable "
19402,120.4,Jazmin,,"but who would like to raise their hand and answer is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","well i have a few things to say so my first answer was it was let me look at it again okay so my first answer was yes and uh my evidence from the text is that astronauts can drink the water and stay hydrated and you can't survive without water and then the more i thought about it like thinking about valuable like convincing reasons it would be valuable i was also thinking that you could use water to grow things and you could have a garden on the moon "
19407,230.2,Jazmin,,"but going back to the question with the part of the question that says evidence that water on the moon can be valuable what are some things that are listed in the text yes a garden can regrow but does it say that in the text ","no it talks about the drinking drinking water but i guess i was just thinking about why water is valuable because student was just talking about that word and that's what made me think about the garden "
19410,420.2,Chris,,"that's very true what you said but as i said earlier we really want to be sure that we're answering what's being asked we don't want to talk about things that are not in the text or what they're not really asking us because that can be a little confusing yes student ","okay i have an idea and it's that that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
19412,230.2,Chris,,"yes did you see that in the text ","in part two "
19415,230.1,Chris,,"why is that important ","oh okay here it is um so they need oxygen the astronauts need oxygen "
19417,210.4,Chris,,"yes and what could the hydrogen ","oh i know there's i know there's i know there's i know this "
19419,130.2,Luis,,"student would you like to help student oh ","yeah i'm student you just need to read the next sentence extra right thing or access oxygen and a high to use as a rocket fuel "
19425,130.2,Farrah,,,"Well, I would say. that you can look at the most important words in the question Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story. "
19427,420.1,Oliver,,"when answering the question we want to look at important words ","i'm not but i have something else to say "
19431,120.4,Oliver,,"student if you have something to say ","no i was done um well i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just i really appreciate how you taught us how to take a question apart and how you also taught us to really look for evidence that our answers they have to come from the text "
19435,150.1,Luis,,"for our next part of our discussion we're going to talk about why it's such a big deal that water is on the moon ","um yeah i you know i really got this figured out i think i'm all good "
19437,230.1,Luis,,"oh go ahead and tell us what you got figured out ","um i meant more like i have it figured out like i can go back to my seat "
19440,120.4,Luis,,"so tell us about why water is why what evidence is there that water could be so valuable to have on the moon ","yeah so you can take water and you can split it into two parts you can make oxygen and hydrogen "
19442,230.1,Luis,,"hmm that's so what why is that such an important thing ","well because you can have those chemicals "
19444,430.2,Luis,,"yeah i agree that you can do a lot with those too so my concern is that you did identify an important piece of evidence but didn't explain why that's so valuable so my suggestion would be to add a reason for why it's so valuable to have those chemicals ","oh like what you can do with them yeah yeah okay i can do that "
19446,230.3,Oliver,,"great while student is revising let's go we'll go we'll start on the other side so student and student i noticed that once again you class must have worked together because you have some similar answers ","yeah we always work together "
19448,230.3,Farrah,,,"i just we're kind of friends but kind of not "
19453,230.3,Farrah,,"so you both wrote that this isn't that using this water isn't something that's going to happen anytime soon is that right ","yeah we were thinking that like maybe it's valuable like 50 years in the future or i don't know at some point in the future but we were thinking that because this question was like is there convincing evidence that water is valuable and we we thinking like no it's not valuable yet "
19459,420.2,Farrah,,"so my suggestion would be to find some reasons why even in that long future that you identified why could it be important to have in the future ","that's a really good point okay i think we can do this "
19462,120.4,Jazmin,,"so let's see student and student who would like to share next ","well i can share yes that astronauts can drink the water to be hydrated and you can't survive without water "
19465,230.1,Jazmin,,"is that why you found that piece of information as a key piece ","yeah it's like yeah i think that's why water is valuable "
19472,420.2,Jazmin,,"so my suggestion would be to keep what you have but now make a connection to why it's important that water is there on the moon ","like ok so like saying why water's important and then say like okay i think that makes sense so like looking and saying like why is it important up on the moon that it's already there Okay. Let me take a look. "
19475,120.4,Chris,,"all right student you're up next ","so i heard i read on facebook by uncle posts a lot of stuff and i read on facebook that there could be a base on the moon that there was maybe one already but there was definitely going to be one by 2024 "
19482,230.1,Chris,,"what did you mean by that ","well like it's heavy to carry water and i remember there was like diet asset that show like where they were all this stuff and they were saying that water was one of the heaviest and one of the hardest things to carry into space so if they already have it in space you don't need to bring any with them "
19486,420.2,Chris,,"To explain what benefit can the astronauts or can NASA have that they don't have to carry this water anymore, so what what other benefit does that provide see if you can expand your answer a little. ","okay i'll take a look "
19492,120.4,Oliver,,"so student and student did you find or did you revise your answers yet ","oh yeah we did ciz we took a look and say we we thought about this question cuz it was asking could it be valuable yeah we were trying to figure out like okay like could it be valuable as opposed to like is it valuable like right now at that was actually really interesting to look at so like basically we want to to revise our answer to say that it would be very valuable um you could use it to make rocket fuel by splitting it into it's like different chemical parts um you could use it to greek arm you could like use it for those things and and maybe you could grow a moon garden which they didn't have in the reading but i thought was an interesting idea "
19494,110.1,Oliver,,"i love that then we could have moon flowers ","i would love moon flowers "
19499,110.1,Farrah,,,"so fortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you for being with us and like in particular i just wanted to say like you really explained like what we needed to work on and i thought maybe that would be hard to hear but actually it was really how i class like it's nice to know like when we we weren't quite right and then we were able to be like okay because then you have this figure out what we should work and it was really helpful because then that i knew that i was going to shift and not going a different direction so thank you so much bye "
19503,220.1,Luis,,"hi class i am your teacher and it's so great to see you all today i'm excited to work with you on trying to oliverelop really complete answers ","yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19507,230.1,Luis,,"and student did your background knowledge help you with your answer to the question i see that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that did you think about that from your background knowledge ","um yeah because if the astronauts were falling to the moon to find the water they definitely needed oxygen tanks 100 i'm positive "
19513,120.2,Oliver,,"reread our question here what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","okay so in the question a word that i circled was equipment "
19516,110.1,Chris,,"equipment great that's an excellent word to circle thank you ","yeah so the word that i circled in the question is water "
19519,110.1,Jazmin,,"water great that's another awesome word in our question ","and the one that i picked was discover "
19522,110.1,Luis,,"discover great that's definitely our action word discover ","well what oxygen tanks would do was they would have the astronaut stay alive while they were looking for the water "
19525,120.4,Farrah,,"and while you do that i'm going to have another student share their response does another student want to share their their answer student yes ","okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19527,210.4,Farrah,,"alright and student i see you circled the same as well so we can address both of you together here so can student can you tell me what does a microscope do ","okay well a microscope and helps you see things that are really really small and in the story except the water was really really small microscopic "
19530,210.2,Oliver,,"but student do you remember what our key action word in our question was ","um yeah i think student said it and it was discover "
19532,210.2,Farrah,,"student do you know what another word for discover might be ","find "
19535,210.3,Farrah,,"in a microscope we're talking about seeing things so do we think that the microscope itself helped to find the water or maybe they they looked at the water with the microscope ","oh okay well it sounds like maybe they just use the microscope to look but i guess what i had been thinking is how can you find it if you can't see it "
19538,210.4,Farrah,,"yes that's an excellent point i think here in the text what they did was they first found the water and they could see the water and then to look even close even a little bit closer they they had to use the microscope okay ","okay okay yeah i'm i'm starting to get a picture of this now "
19540,210.4,Chris,,,"yeah well i just wanted to say so i actually went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19545,120.4,Chris,,"and so student did that help you answer the question what was your answer ","at the sulfur for my answer i said that the scientists found the creator's full of water on the moon "
19549,120.3,Chris,,"but i would like for you to reread for me the first sentence of paragraph three can you read that allowed for us student ","oh yeah okay it says this means the room is still drier than the driest desert on earth "
19551,210.3,Chris,,"yes so i see that you had said that the craters were full of water on the moon but does it seem like there's a lot of water in these craters or maybe just a little bit ","well i mean that part definitely just a little bit "
19554,230.3,Oliver,,"yeah definitely and i think your answer is really telling us where they found the tech where they found the water but def i see you have something to say ","yeah so um i just actually looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to carefully explain the different action words for the different tools i'm using that keyword really helped me in student figure out that microscope part so thank you so much "
19558,230.3,Chris,,,"thanks hi teacher how are you "
19562,230.1,Luis,,"student and i just sorry or sir could you please just explain your answer a little bit to me ","sure excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19564,110.1,Luis,,"oh isn't ","yes "
19567,110.1,Chris,,"i think can you just let the student finishes answer and i will get back to you later ","yeah yeah okay so here are my answer was a scientist on craters full of water on the moon "
19572,230.1,Chris,,"how can you come up with this answer ","um yeah so i was looking for the words like equipment and finding or discovering water on the moon and it was in the first paragraph that i saw that they said um let's see okay this indices scientists have found evidence the water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so they talk about finding water on the moon in that sentence and scientists to "
19583,230.1,Chris,,,"Oh yeah I guess I forgot about that part. Okay yeah sure. "
19585,230.1,Jazmin,,,"excuse me teacher "
19588,230.1,Jazmin,,,"i got my answer from the second paragraph so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19593,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay so can you tell me ","yeah i said nasa sent a small machine okay that's right out of the second paragraph which you told student to look "
19600,430.2,Jazmin,,"the in the question the scientists asked what equipment did scientists they use so can you tell me like what exactly equipment the scientists to use i saw you just say a small machine can you tell me the name of the machine ","i don't remember the name of it um lunar orbiter okay it's a lunar orbiter "
19603,520.1,Jazmin,,"next time you see this kind of question please be as specific as you can to answer the question okay ","oh okay "
19607,520.1,Chris,,,"oh no teacher i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like um oxygen tanks and masks and soups "
19615,150.1,Chris,,"let's get back to the tax have you found the correct answer student ","okay so in the second paragraph i saw that on them the equipment that student just said the lunar orbiter "
19617,110.1,Chris,,"yeah yeah great ","okay so that's the answer "
19622,110.1,Chris,,"yes ","guess i just didn't know how to how to change my answer should i just say i'm scientists use the lunar orbiter and found craters full of water on the moon "
19625,230.2,Chris,,"did you finding the passage ","oh "
19629,230.2,Chris,,"yeah which line it's ","the lunar orbiter will learn at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool of crater so "
19634,210.3,Chris,,"the sentence and your previous answer ","yeah yeah cuz i'm this one the one i just read says they'll look for ice deposit in a large polar crater in my sentence says they found craters full of water so i mean it's it's it the both of them talk about the crater but i guess in the this sentence it says ice and not water i guess that's the difference "
19640,110.1,Chris,,"yeah i'm glad you find the differences and ","Okay, better better like about the question or just any keyword to the answer. "
19643,120.2,Oliver,,"okay you think the most important words in the question ","um excuse me teacher it's time for us to go so we'll have to see you later okay "
19645,120.2,Oliver,,,"you're welcome bye "
19652,150.1,Luis,,"so have you found your answer ","i think so let me look back at those sentence again um teacher okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
19654,120.4,Luis,,"okay so student can you tell me like what your answers ","yeah okay so um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen "
19658,230.2,Luis,,"so can you tell me like where you found this answer student ","okay i might not have read the whole thing let me see okay okay so i didn't find it in the story cuz i already know about space so i just pulled that one out of my brain "
19663,230.2,Luis,,,"um yeah okay so it's asking me to say what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon. "
19666,210.3,Luis,,"what's the purpose of this equipment ","to find water "
19672,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay so can you go back to your answer and then now does your answer like address this question ","oh and okay so so no it doesn't address that question because you know accident tanks are used to breathe but i guess they're not used to find water Okay teacher i'm still kind of confused "
19674,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah just me and you tell me oh watch confuse you ","yes okay so you asked me what the name of it was in so i see that the name of the machine is the lunar orbiter and but then i guess i don't know like do i just have to add that to my answer i guess i don't know what when i'm supposed to write for my answer "
19679,230.1,Jazmin,,,"Okay yeah it's the same thing, even said, you know it wants us to tell what the equipment is that the scientists used to discover the water on the moon. so yes i i had that the small machine but then i was going to just add called a lunar orbiter but i guess i don't know if that's if that's enough of the answer or not "
19683,210.3,Jazmin,,"just the machines name right ","yes "
19685,210.3,Jazmin,,,"so i god is the difference is just adding the name "
19693,430.2,Jazmin,,"in this way that you are answer the question and in your original answer you just said it's a small machine so it's still an equipment you didn't tell people like what kind of equipment they use so ","Okay. "
19696,430.2,Chris,,,"iphone on the keywords on the keywords that you asked i think we're equipment discover water on the moon you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
19699,230.2,Chris,,"oh a lot where do you find this information ","on the internet or cuz i would like to read about what's going on at nasa and so there was an article on the internet talking about some of the work that are that the scientists are doing to try to find life and on the moon and so they may be in three years they could put a base up there me "
19709,230.2,Chris,,,"I think it was the one that says. all the second sentence maybe in paragraph two "
19711,230.2,Chris,,,"yeah this lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposits in a large pool a crater "
19716,230.2,Chris,,"oh where like where did you find your previous answer in this paragraph ","oh no it was in the first paragraph "
19721,510.1,Oliver,,"when you're trying to answer this question just to try to locate these keywords in the paragraph ","yeah i understand um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for when you explain to student and student the strategy of trying to look at the keywords and the question and then finding the keyword in that story also to underline that gives me ideas on what i need to work on to "
19723,510.1,Oliver,,,"you're welcome "
19726,510.1,Farrah,,,"bye hi "
19733,150.1,Luis,,"and we have a reading that i i understand that you read it already that is called the moon is a desert right ","excuse me i should be in this class i already know all about space "
19735,110.3,Luis,,"already so maybe you can teach us you can tell us about it okay ","okay yeah that sounds great "
19740,120.2,Oliver,,"what was the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon ","yes can i go "
19743,120.2,Oliver,,,"well i think that they used on won't student and i we kind of have the same answer and we both thought that the scientists used a microscope because the story said the water was really small like so small you couldn't even see it and so you'd need a microscope so like you could see the water "
19751,120.1,Jazmin,,"can you remember what was that ","well i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19756,130.1,Jazmin,,"we are getting closer to the to the answer they sent a small machine ","and let me look into nasa sent small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate a lunar orbiter "
19761,110.4,Jazmin,,"that's the answer that i was looking for ","oh so i just had to say the name "
19769,150.1,Farrah,,"so i want to hear all of your ideas ","hi i'm student well i said the microscope too like student said and i still a little confused about how come how come it's the lunar orbiter and not a microscope can you explain that again "
19774,210.4,Farrah,,"when these discovered this tiny water then after that they use the microscope carries and being ","oh oh so they had to they had to send the lunar orbiter first to find it and then they had to use the microscope to see it "
19777,210.4,Chris,,"yeah just see this tiny water ","so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like science some like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19781,210.3,Chris,,"you're right but the you think that for these experiment they send a oxygen tanks do you think it was necessary to send oxygen tanks to discover water ","well if there were astronauts they'd need them but maybe if it was a ship with no astronauts than they wouldn't need that so were there astronauts or no "
19783,210.4,Chris,,"in the reading these doesn't mention that they sent astronauts they send that they just sent the lunar orbiter to find this water and the lunar orbiter is a robot a robot doesn't need oxygen to survive ","yeah that's really causing me see wow so it was just a robot and it was able to go around the moon and and find the water for them "
19787,210.4,Oliver,,"and find these little amount of water in there ","well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text on such a such a deep level like i understand now why they use a microscope later and i weren't even astronauts there and you just really helped us read it written really detailed so we could understand it so thank you so much "
19792,210.4,Farrah,,,"nice to meet you "
19795,150.1,Luis,,"nice to meet you too i understood that you read the text already that the text is called water on the moon am i correct you read it already ","we read it already and i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19798,150.1,Luis,,"so maybe you can learn something here and maybe we can help you to improve your knowledge or maybe you can help us to enter or knowledge or knowledge okay ","okay yeah sounds good to me "
19802,210.4,Chris,,"first of all let's think about these texts okay and let's think about the main ideas of these texts okay so can you tell me where are the main idea of this text ","well so i think the main idea of the story is that that there's actually water on the moon and they used to think there wasn't any but now they know that there is water on the moon "
19806,210.4,Oliver,,"but so the you have another thought about what could be another main idea of this text ","i offer one "
19808,210.4,Oliver,,,"so you said the subtitle and the subtitle is a moon is a desert so i think the point as actually that even though they found water on the moon there's not that much of it it's really small oh also it's ice and not water "
19811,210.4,Oliver,,"okay so what is the other subtitle that we can discuss about ","i don't know "
19814,210.4,Farrah,,"what is the other main idea that we can learn ","are you talking about the part that says water is a valuable resource "
19816,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah i'm talking about so what do you think about that ","well actually i'm still a little confused about the first part "
19820,120.2,Farrah,,"So the first question that I want to tell you is what equipment if scientists used to this cover water on the moon. ","yeah so i thought the main word was equipment and so my answer was you would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why that answer is wrong "
19825,120.4,Jazmin,,"is your answer is enough okay student ","student i know you said equipment and i think that's important but actually i think the more important word is actually discover "
19830,210.2,Farrah,,"we have two main words in this question discover and equipment ","it's to look really closely at really small things "
19833,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah and also we use microscopes to observe and to analyze right ","oh yeah you're right "
19836,210.4,Chris,,"so we have to think about another equipment before that helped them to discover water since the beginning student ","yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19838,230.2,Chris,,"yeah that's right well what in the text makes you think that within the next what do you see that maybe that can be an equipment for this idea ","from the story "
19841,230.2,Chris,,"yeah from this story like for this case for this specific case we're talking about discovering water in the moono so what in the text makes you think about they need oxygen tanks to discover water ","i well i guess those aren't from the story but i just thought because we were talking about equipment that that's equipment that scientists sometimes use "
19846,130.1,Farrah,,"when they need astronauts and they need human beings because human beings human beings needs oxygen over there ","so it's time for us to go but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about where we found our answers and then whether or not being worked with that word discover that was really helpful "
19849,130.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi miss teacher it's good to see you "
19855,120.4,Luis,,"you want to say something about the text student ","yeah i do i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19857,110.3,Luis,,"yeah i know but maybe you can help us okay ","oh yeah "
19862,420.1,Oliver,,"what are the main words of this question in order to have an answer we have to pay attention to the question and we have to know what is exactly the thing that they are asking for ","okay so i said a main word in the question was equipment because you know that the answer has to be like a thing a tool "
19865,230.2,Oliver,,"you're right so what in the text makes you think that that's a that's a main word what do you think that ","what do i think is the right answer "
19867,230.2,Oliver,,,"okay well so my answer was that the equipment up and used what's the microscope "
19871,210.2,Chris,,"okay so what is another main word in this question ","Okay. So I said, the main point was water. "
19876,210.2,Jazmin,,"what is the verb of this question ","and so a verb is an action word and the action word in the question is discover and that's what i thought was the main word "
19881,230.2,Jazmin,,"can someone told me where is your answer according to the text ","and my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19884,210.4,Luis,,"can someone remember what is the specific name of this robot ","yeah i know that's one it's the lunar orbiter student come on "
19889,210.4,Chris,,"so when they discover water on the moon what happened next what is the next step when they discovered these ice deposits in the craters ","next step like so after they after they find the water in the craters well so on after the part about the lunar orbiter it talks about how there's not very much of it so maybe they measured it because it says there's 32 ounces so maybe after they found it they measured it "
19892,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah after that they have to they have to make an observation right and how can you observe this water and someone told me what is another woman on maybe they can they they will need to observe this water ","um well i think that was my answer the microscope "
19895,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah the microscope so can you tell me what is the main um what do you use the microscope for ","well i thought who was the answer to the question about about what they use to discover the water i guess i'm not quite sure why why the microscope isn't just the whole answer "
19897,230.3,Farrah,,"so you think that the microscope is the only equipment that they use to discover this water ","so i guess it sounds like maybe they have to use both "
19901,110.1,Oliver,,"so that's the main idea that's the main equipment that we use but class has excellent ideas and now i know that class read this text and class has knowledge about this so i am very impressed with your with your answers ","so i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you for helping us think about the main words in the question because that helps us find the very best answer in the text "
19903,110.1,Farrah,,,"hi hi how are you "
19906,110.1,Farrah,,,"oh good oh good it's nice to meet you so so we just finished reading the water on the moon "
19908,120.2,Luis,,"so our discussion question today is going to be what equipment and scientists use to discover water on the moon ","excuse me excuse me this is student um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space "
19917,150.1,Farrah,,"is that clear ","okay so should we just talk to each other or what do you want us to do "
19920,150.1,Farrah,,"that clear ","yeah okay thank you yeah "
19923,110.1,Chris,,"okay you said that scientists found craters full of water in the moon ","yeah i thought that was so cool "
19925,120.3,Chris,,"yeah that's interesting um i wanted to point a specific area i wanted us to read together um can you look at bullet number three and read the first sentence out to me ","okay oh part three you said the first sentence okay it says that means the moon is still drier than the dryest desert on earth "
19927,210.4,Chris,,"when you think of a desert do you think of what do you think what do you see ","all like like lots of sand as far as the eye could see and the sun beating down really hard and like cactuses and stuff "
19931,210.3,Chris,,"do you want to rethink your response and see and see if that maybe makes sense to you that if the moon is drier than the driest desert do you think there's water on the moon a lot of water ","well there's definitely water but hackers maybe the craters are full of water like i was kind of picturing that in my head that they were full of water like little pools but i guess if it's like a desert it must be a lot smaller and harder to see "
19933,120.1,Chris,,"yeah so how about you take a deep read of the three points and see if you can figure out what equipment they might have used to get that really small bit of water out ","okay i'll read it "
19935,120.4,Jazmin,,"thank you hi student you have a question for me ","yes i said that necessity a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
19939,120.3,Jazmin,,"can you read the second sentence out loud to me ","okay the second sentence on this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit handle large polar crater "
19941,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah so what do you think that it's doing once it finds those ice deposits ","don't really know because i know that it looks for them but i don't really know what it does next i don't think it's "
19943,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah it doesn't say that but if we read between the lines that i'm the machine is sent to go and look for them and then they're able to look at them underneath the microscope what do you think that might mean ","maybe they're studying it "
19945,110.1,Jazmin,,"yeah they're definitely studying it in order to find the water um ","so that's not answer right just the small machine "
19947,110.2,Jazmin,,"it's definitely your that's correct that it was a small machine that they sent to find the ice deposits or just trying to look a little bit deeper into what the machine was doing in order to discover the water on the moon ","oh oh okay so just add some more to my answer "
19950,110.2,Chris,,,"yeah well i was thinking about equipment and actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
19954,510.1,Chris,,"when we read we want to make sure that we're backing up what we're saying with information from the text ","oh you mean the story "
19956,510.1,Chris,,,"no it doesn't say oxygen tanks in the story "
19959,520.1,Chris,,"so every single time that we're using information from a text in order to answer a discussion question we want to make sure that we're referencing back to the text even though we might know a lot about the subject reading already ","so i need to pick up pick up a piece of equipment from the story "
19961,520.1,Chris,,,"okay that makes sense yeah "
19963,120.4,Oliver,,"student and student were you able to find out more information through working together ","on actually i just looked up clock and we have to build a lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for having us look back at the text and look for really detailed answers on that was really helpful so thank you so much "
19965,120.4,,,,"hello class thank you for sharing your responses to "
19969,230.2,Luis,,"i was wondering if you could tell me where you what made you say your response have you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely ","i'm excuse me excuse me i have my hand up "
19972,110.1,Farrah,,"student i will get back to you in one minute you can reread the passage right now ","okay so you asked us where where we found the microscope "
19974,110.1,Farrah,,,"okay so it's in part three and it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
19979,210.4,Farrah,,"Okay, can you two reread the second paragraph and see if that changes your answer. ","yeah okay we can look at it "
19981,210.4,Luis,,,"yes please um so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
19987,420.1,Farrah,,"i want you to reread it and think about what the most important part of the question is and circle that okay ","okay okay we looked at part two again "
19989,210.3,Farrah,,"okay did you have any different thoughts ","well i guess in part two it talks about a machine but i don't really understand why my answer is wrong "
19998,210.2,Oliver,,"so if we are trying to answer the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon the discovering is the aspect that we want to be focusing on so what tool did they use to discover the water ","oh well i mean i guess i kind of thought it was the microscope because if the water so small how can you discover it until you can actually see Yeah, I'm on the same page as Farrah here. I kind of agree because like if you need to discover it i i guess that's why i picked a microscope because it seems like that's the tool you'd need to see it yeah "
20002,210.4,Oliver,,"can you find some evidence about how they found that first sample ","oh i i don't see the word sample on in the story but it talks about the ice deposits "
20004,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah so how did they find those ice deposits ","okay um they the lunar orbiter will land on the moon south pole and look for ice deposits "
20006,210.3,Oliver,,"yeah so does that sound like an answer to the question that we are trying to answer ","um i guess yeah that sounds like they use the lunar orbiter to help find the water but i don't know if i would have picked it the first time "
20013,210.2,Chris,,"what part of the question did you pull out as being the most important part ","okay so i said the word equipment was the most important part and on well i actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20015,430.3,Chris,,"So can you try and reread and think about what equipment, other than The oxygen tanks and masks they used to find the water on the moon? ","oh so like equipment that's in the story "
20017,430.3,Chris,,,"okay yeah i'll look at "
20019,210.2,Jazmin,,"student and student what did you pull out as being the most important part of the question ","i picked discover "
20022,230.1,Jazmin,,"discover why did you pick the term discover ","because it sort of tells you what the machine what the equipment does so that sounded that sounded important because it's like the action "
20026,110.4,Oliver,,"yeah definitely is very important thank you for for responding ","come i'm so sorry but um it's it's actually time for us to go now but before before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to us and help us understand the importance of the word discover for our answers thank you "
20033,120.4,Luis,,"student what did you say was the most important part of the question ","i still have to say i just want to remind you my dad is actually an astronaut "
20035,110.3,Luis,,"well thank you student that will definitely help our conversation ","i thought so that's why i had to say it "
20037,120.4,Jazmin,,"thank you student what were you gonna say was the most important part of the question ","okay so i think the most important part of the question is evidence "
20040,130.2,Oliver,,"evidence thank you does class agree with student about evidence or does somebody have a different idea ","okay well um i thought that the most important part of the question was the word convincing because it seems like when you're thinking about the question you need to be convinced whether the water on the moon is going to be good "
20044,230.1,Farrah,,"student and student i want to to ask you why you think that the water is not ready yet or isn't going to be for a long time what made you say that ","well i guess i think i got it from the last part of the of the story part six because it says that in order to use the water it will take a lot of time and money so it's not like they could just go to the moon and drink the water today "
20049,230.1,Oliver,,"student what made you say that it's not ready yet ","um yeah yeah i'll kind of the same like student sad um i think it was the part yeah at the end because it sounds like it's going to be really expensive and there there wasn't that much water from like the first part of the story so it just seems like a waste of money and it's just not ready "
20052,210.4,Oliver,,"um i wanted to ask you to dive deeper into what would be required for their to find water on the moon what exactly makes it be so expensive and take so much time for them to get the water on the moon okay ","Yeah, we'll do that. "
20055,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i have an idea "
20057,120.4,Jazmin,,"yes student ","well i think you can use water to grow things so we could have a moon garden on the moon "
20060,430.3,Jazmin,,"i'm concerned that you didn't read deep enough to see how how difficult it would be to get the water so i want you to take another look at the reading and see what evidence you could find to support it being worthwhile to get to the water on the moon why it's so important to use all that time and effort and money to get to the water okay ","yeah i'm sorry you want me to read it again "
20062,420.3,Jazmin,,"yeah read it again and think about why it would be worthwhile to spend the money and to use the time ","okay "
20064,120.4,Chris,,"yes student ","water can be broken down into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
20069,210.4,Luis,,"and to find the evidence that it would make it worthwhile for them to mine for the water on the moon um what other functions water has ","yeah i got one i got one "
20072,120.4,Luis,,"yes student ","yeah so i know you could drink it well it doesn't sound like there's a lot of drinking but it also said like what the hydrogen and oxygen you could use it to make a rocket fuel "
20075,230.1,Luis,,"when you said just then that there wasn't a lot of it does that mean that you think that it would be worthwhile or not to find it ","no i didn't really think of that "
20079,230.1,Luis,,"do you think that that would convince you that it's worthwhile ","you know i think the rocket fuel on the sounds pretty useful but i think i might have to learn a little more about cars if that was more water it might be useful but if it's only one is it felt like a murmur four cups that doesn't sound very useful "
20083,120.4,Oliver,,"student you have a question ","yeah so um we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you because you listened to each one of our answers and you asked every one of us to think about our answer in a new way like if we said it wasn't valuable you asked us to think maybe it could be and if we said it was valuable you asked us to think maybe wouldn't be so we all have to think about the question from both both sides and that was really cool "
20086,120.4,Farrah,,,"hi it's nice to meet you "
20089,150.1,Luis,,"so we were we were investigating the water on the moon text first i want to ask you class did you class enjoy this test did you learn anything from it student go ahead ","excuse me i don't i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20095,150.1,Chris,,"see some head nods class want to share ","here this is student i thought it was really cool that scientists they found craters full of water on the moon i never knew that before "
20100,140.1,Oliver,,"student go ahead i like that shirt i have the same shirt actually that's a really cool shirt ","thank you well i just thought it was really interesting that the moon was a desert because i never really thought about like what the moon was made off on like what what it felt like and looked like and stuff "
20106,120.4,Farrah,,"so does class does class want to volunteer in a response to that question i have any ideas about that ","i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20110,110.1,Jazmin,,"hmm that's a good answer does class else have any any any ideas about that before we get into talking about it ","well nasa sent a small machine didn't understand why my answer is wrong "
20121,130.1,Luis,,"that's a great place to start as and thank you ","yeah i got this it's called a lunar orbiter it's called lunar orbiter "
20126,210.4,Oliver,,"and can someone remind me exactly what a lunar orbiter does so like you said they said the small machine what did they use it for just can you class just remind me ","well i guess story it says they use it to investigate but but i circled the same as student about the microscope because you need that because the water is so small like can you find that if you can't even see it "
20132,130.2,Chris,,"can we can someone remind me of that ","yeah i can because yeah go ahead go ahead american yeah that's my answer they found the water in the craters and they found the craters full of water "
20137,210.4,Chris,,"it's very very very small so we need to use that scientific tool called like you said a microscope to look at the water really closely ","Go ahead. Well, I went to NASA. And so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits. "
20146,120.1,Jazmin,,"so i wanted someone to elaborate on their first answer ","i can try so nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then they had to use a microscope and the astronauts also use all the stuff that student talked about too "
20156,110.1,Oliver,,"so yeah i think you class did a great job with the text student go ahead ","well yeah i was just gonna say it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i just wanted to see thank you because it was really cool to think about how the moon would feel and i really like that you talked about that and you'll also help us understand how each of our answers connected to the question and it was just really fun to talk to you today "
20159,110.1,Farrah,,,"it's good to see you "
20162,110.1,Farrah,,,"it's been pretty good yeah "
20167,120.4,Luis,,"student go ahead ","um yeah so we were reading water on the moon and i just want to remind you i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20173,150.1,Luis,,"and that we all can come to a solid answer for the prompt so you might even find that you might even learn some new stuff today and too so i'm glad that you're the expert i appreciate that thank you ","of course anytime thank you "
20176,120.4,Oliver,,"student go ahead and love that smile go ahead ","um yeah it's all what equipment did scientists to was to discover water on the moon "
20182,120.4,Farrah,,"there are many volunteers student yes go ahead ","um i said that she would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20187,230.1,Farrah,,"i actually have a follow up question for you um what made you what made you say that as your answer what stuff what really stood out to you why did you say that ","so it's in it's in paragraph three and they talked about a tool called a microscope and they talked about how the ice was really small and so you can all see it if you didn't have a microscope "
20190,230.3,Farrah,,"ah ok so you really focus on the word microscope that's something that you really focused on ","yeah because it's a tool "
20194,110.1,Chris,,"well said it is a tool you're correct so let's right let's write that down i'll keep that in note and i'm going to move on to someone else and see what they had but thank you for volunteering ","yeah so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20198,110.2,Chris,,"full of water on the moon good observation yes i remember that from the text as well good job ","oh well okay so in part one they talk about water can be found deep within the moon's polar crater "
20204,120.4,Jazmin,,"student go ahead ","okay well i said that yes i sent a small machine and don't understand why my answers wrong "
20207,230.2,Jazmin,,"So I'm glad you said that. So I'm going to follow up with you with the same question I had, which event and Chris, what exactly what language or what part of that. Did you see and think, oh, that's the answer to the prompt that has given me. ","well they talked about it in part two that's where i found my answer and i guess i know i was looking for some kind of equipment from the question and a small machine seemed like a piece of equipment and and they described describe how it looks for ice "
20210,120.4,Chris,,"teacher and i think that's something that we could all use so i'm gonna i'm gonna ask you class a question again so student go ahead ","oh yeah so i went to nasa and i know that scientists use all sorts of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
20213,120.4,Chris,,,"oh yeah no that's it i just saw all this stuff at nasa and so since we're talking about equipment i was thinking that they probably used all that stuff "
20221,110.1,Oliver,,"I love the participation so far from everybody. You guys are doing great. ","excuse me "
20225,110.1,Oliver,,"yep just give me a moment student i'm going to have class think about it for 15 more seconds then i'll come to you okay ","well i just i wanted to say actually um it's time it's time for the next class we have to go but um i wanted to say thank you so much because you really helped us feel that our answers and the stuff that we already know what's really valuable and important and you also helped us look in the text and understand where our answers came from "
20230,420.1,Luis,,"identify one word to focus on that when you go back into the text you can use that word to help you answer the question ","okay yeah i know people are still working but i just wanted to remind you that my dad is actually an astronaut "
20235,210.3,Luis,,"do you have a question do you have an answer for for the vocab words you would choose from the question ","oh yeah i have an answer equipment "
20237,130.2,Oliver,,"equipment good i'm just gonna pull class in the class and see if we're on the same page or if someone else wants to tell me something different student go ahead ","oh yeah i had also picked equipment actually so "
20242,210.3,Farrah,,"student have you chosen a vocab word yet ","um yeah i guess yeah the equipment seems important "
20244,130.2,Chris,,"okay thank you for giving your answer i'm sorry to just call on you out of the blue but um i think it's important to get everyone's input so we can all be on the same page student what you think ","well actually i thought that it was water what equipment to find water on the moon "
20246,130.2,Jazmin,,"good i like that too i like that we can have different answers so so we'll consider water as well and student what do you have ","discover "
20254,420.3,Jazmin,,"take two minutes and read and while you're reading you can highlight underlined some words that might help you but i want a sentence for out of class for a revised answer ","can i ask something "
20256,420.3,Jazmin,,,"i know you want us to reread again but i don't know how to fix my answer cuz i don't i don't know why it's wrong because i picked the equipment to discover so what do i do "
20263,210.3,Jazmin,,"alright i see people looking up so i think we're gonna i'm gonna ask for some provide answers so maybe maybe some new information that people found to help me answer the prompt ","i guess i can try to add more detail for my answer so when i looked at again i found a few details about the machine and it said the center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i guess i would say on that the equipment they use to sign the water was a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
20267,310.1,Oliver,,"great answer student i love how you went back and you found specific you even found even more evidence than you already had that was very impressive and you use that to make a complete answer i love your answer he told us what equipment they use and what it was called exactly and what it did was it three great things thank you for that that was awesome ","i yep okay um so using those three words we picked i would say the equipment to discover the water was a microscope "
20270,230.1,Oliver,,"what made you say that ","paragraph three remember yeah it's in paragraph three and it says that says on waters microscopic and you need a microscope to see it's so the equipment used to discover water was a microscope oh "
20278,130.3,Oliver,,"but the thing that we're really looking forward to the lunar orbiter okay ","okay um can i try again can i do another answer "
20280,130.3,Oliver,,,"okay so i would say if i was putting it all together i would say the equipment to discover the water was first a lunar orbiter and then a microscope "
20289,210.4,Oliver,,"and the water is microscopic it's so small that they might even need a microscope to find that water so even when they got there with the lunar orbiter they might have had to use a microscope because there's such small amounts of water ","oh yeah it sounds like you're wrapping up and we have to go to lunch to um but you can finish what you were saying "
20292,210.4,Oliver,,,"thank you for helping us make the best to answer so we could make with all of the details that we need "
20295,210.4,Farrah,,,"good morning "
20297,210.4,Farrah,,,"first period first period i know i know "
20302,150.1,Luis,,"student hang on one second i know some of you were really interested in that and had the same question i did like how did the scientists so far away find water ","um well i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
20307,140.1,Farrah,,"were you surprised student that the scientists found water on the moon ","yeah i never thought there would be water on the moon i thought it was just i don't know dry up there "
20310,140.1,Oliver,,"yeah me either i think that's what the scientists thought too ","oh well i don't think i never really thought about that before like maybe there is water on the moon maybe around the moon i wasn't really i never really thought about it i guess "
20313,140.1,Jazmin,,"yeah so those are this article made you think about something new that's it that's a really good reason to be reading current news ","yes i would say i would say i was surprised "
20315,140.1,Chris,,"how about you student ","oh well i actually went to nasa and well i didn't know there was water on the moon but i thought it was really cool "
20318,140.1,Luis,,"so you know there's a there was a lot of information in this article wasn't there student or someone who's experienced about space wasn't there a lot of information about in the article ","yeah yeah there was stuff in there "
20322,220.1,Jazmin,,"yeah yeah some great stuff so we're we're here today because we're going to think about when we're reading how do we when there's lots of information in an article how do we focus on the information that we need so sometimes when i'm reading there's so much information i have a hard time finding what i'm looking for ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20325,110.2,Jazmin,,"oh well what makes you think your answers wrong ","since we're all in this small class and doesn't that mean our answers are quite right "
20329,150.1,Jazmin,,"is we can help each other and you can help me to kind of dig down into our article that's called close reading have you done close reading before ","like in an english class "
20333,150.1,Jazmin,,"do you all have your article and some cut something to market mark on it with ","yes we do "
20340,150.1,Oliver,,"student do you remember that question from yesterday ","yeah yeah i do "
20344,150.1,Farrah,,"okay so you hit you see it student is it on your paper ","yes yes it's here on the top of the paper "
20353,420.1,Chris,,"So what's one important word take a minute and circle that on your question and I'm going to ask you what you circled ","oh it's just gonna say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20355,210.3,Chris,,"so what it what word did you circle then ","um equipment "
20358,210.3,Jazmin,,"what did you circle student ","i circled discover "
20365,420.2,Oliver,,"I wonder sometimes if we could even use those words to help us look even deeper. So what if we turn those words into the beginning of a statement and figure out if the rest of the information is in the text. So, Oliver. What's up, ","i'm so sorry this class is so fun but we have to go to lunch now and i just wanted to say thank you so much you were so nice and you really helped us understand the question and what the question was asking us when you helped us find those keywords and i know that's going to be really helpful in other classes just like you said not just language like not just english i'm not just science but like all of our classes so thank you so much for joining us today "
20373,420.3,Luis,,"so i suggest you go back to the text and maybe underline what you find again can you do that for me ","i don't understand why i shouldn't i don't feel like i should be on this class you know i already know a lot about space "
20376,410.1,Luis,,"but i'm a little concerned that you did not connect the question to the text so looking back at the question what's the question that we're looking for can you tell me that are you able to tell me what the question is ","yeah it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
20379,120.1,Luis,,"great yes so now i suggest that the two of you go back to the text and circle the answer your new answer after looking for that are you able to do that for me ","a new answer "
20385,420.3,Jazmin,,"Chris. Can you go back and look at the text and see what other the main equipment that was used ","i don't understand my my answers wrong "
20389,420.2,Jazmin,,"So I suggest you go back to the text underline what answer you just gave me and then I want you to circle. Something else that links with that to help further your answer. Can you do that for me. ","okay my answer and then circle start "
20392,420.2,Jazmin,,"so i want you to underline what you did answer which was nasa sent a small machine so underlined small machine okay and then i want you to just circle more detail with that that would further your answer a little bit more ","okay "
20396,210.3,Farrah,,"student and student were you able to find a little bit more information about what equipment ","we looked at it all in well i mean i still feel like my answer was right "
20398,210.3,Oliver,,,"yeah me too "
20400,210.4,Farrah,,"was there any other equipment that was used in the text ","um well i mean when i was looking at it i did see they they talked about the machine and in paragraph two "
20402,210.4,Farrah,,"okay tell me a little bit more about that machine that you read about ","oh okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will end at the south pole and look for ice deposits or large pool of crater these two positives very small "
20406,210.3,Farrah,,"okay so do you believe that this could have been part of the equipment that was used to discover water on the moon ","i mean i'm like it could be but but the question asks about water and i'm in my part it also talks about them looking for water with a microscope so and i don't see anything about water in this "
20409,420.3,Chris,,"but i think i want you to know that you are on the right track with the lunar orbiter okay so read a little bit more and maybe take some time to underline some keywords in your texts ","i went to nasa which i know that scientists use like a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks suits "
20412,110.1,Chris,,"yes that's awesome and maybe at another time we can talk about your experience and you can share that with the class i think that they would learn a lot for me ","okay um yeah so i guess we have to go to lunch anyway but yeah thanks for coming to visit us and on visit our class and kind of ask us some questions about what would read about in the text "
20416,120.3,Luis,,"but how about we look once again at the text you know ","um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20423,150.1,Farrah,,"and whenever somebody thinks they have the answer just raise your hand and i'll call on you ","okay so um the name for the equipment that i found is microscope "
20427,120.1,Farrah,,"if we look in paragraph two can do you see any other name of a machine ","um well okay you said part two on it says a small machine called a lunar orbiter i don't know what that is "
20430,120.3,Chris,,"yeah well that's the cool thing about this text so it kind of explains it um student do you mind reading section two out loud ","on yeah i can do that okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
20434,110.2,Farrah,,"and you know what's been i was wrong i'm sorry about that i just realized that said what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so the microscope was part of the equipment so you are also right so thank you for that as well ","okay so they're both the right answer yep "
20438,210.4,Jazmin,,"they're both part of the equipment that was used see yeah yeah because you need the microscope to see the water since it was so small ","yeah so i'm wondering that was my answer that nasa such a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20440,110.2,Jazmin,,"um well your answer actually isn't wrong they're both right because the small machine the lunar orbiter and also the microscope were both correct so that was just all the equipment they used ","oh okay so if i just put nasa sent a small machine then i'm right "
20444,210.3,Jazmin,,"you know what else did they use ","oh ok so it's kind of like they a tool like work together "
20446,120.4,Chris,,"exactly yep exactly yeah what did what would you have said student what was your answer the second time you ","well so well my first answer was scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20449,120.4,Chris,,"oh did you have a second answer maybe or any thoughts new thoughts that came to mind after reading through it ","yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20452,210.4,Luis,,"and now what about you student did you you know learn anything new from this paragraph i know you love space but you know ","um yeah i mean so my answer was kind of like what student just pass i said scientists he has a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
20455,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah cool and how are you deaf did you you know have anything that you learned from this paragraph and maybe anything about the equipment that scientists use ","on your so well i said the same thing i said about the microscope and i guess i'm just not quite sure why you need to have both on both the orbiter and the microscope because i mean the question asked her about what equipment they use to discover the water and i still think of some microscope because how can you discover something if you can't even see it "
20460,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense ","yeah so that's kind of like they use first they use the lunar orbiter and then i use a microscope "
20462,110.1,Oliver,,"yep exactly you said it perfectly yeah ","thanks "
20465,140.1,Luis,,"so student did you did you like reading over this paragraph or you know did you find it interesting or any thoughts ","yeah i thought it was a really interesting because i didn't actually know that there was water on the moon before i read this and i thought it was so cool how they sent that lunar orbiter and it was like this robot that found the water for them i really want to help make something like that one day cool "
20467,140.1,Oliver,,"yeah and student like was this the spark any interest in you or yes ","i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us see both the big picture and the sort of specifics of the equipment um that was a really helpful way to put it thank you so much "
20474,120.3,Luis,,"can you can you read a little bit earlier in the text for me ","yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20479,120.4,Farrah,,"so svaannah have you found anything yet about an any other equipment ","yeah yeah in the in the second paragraph it talks about how nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and so a machine is equipment too "
20484,110.1,Chris,,"yeah exactly ","let me see it investigated the lunar orbiter will land at the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater okay it investigated and it looked for ice deposits "
20487,210.4,Jazmin,,"student can you explain what the microscope did like what they use the microscope to do in this process ","for this one i mean i know what we use it for in science class "
20489,210.4,Jazmin,,,"let's see for this one these it to look really closely at the water "
20494,210.4,Oliver,,"student can you kind of explain it seems like there's two parts do you kind of see what i'm saying here there's two parts to this with the lunar orbiter and the microscope can you explain to the class you know how those two work together ","okay um so what you said is that um student was right and student what student read and student read was right too because there are two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and a microscope "
20497,130.3,Farrah,,"yeah yeah so there's two so i think it could be seen like the lunar orbiter went first and did the big picture work to see if there was water and then the microscope came in afterward and did the more smaller picture ","i still don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20503,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah that makes sense "
20507,120.4,Luis,,"yeah so student did you learn anything from this from this reading ","well i mean ok so now i know that there's like a microscope in space and a lunar orbiter and space um yeah i mean i guess that's it "
20512,210.4,Luis,,"the potential uses of water was that exciting or like did you think it would be useful if there was water on the moon ","well mean i think any place that there's water would be good because people always get thirsty and they want to drink stuff yeah "
20514,210.4,Chris,,,"you know i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20519,210.4,Chris,,"did you think of could you think of any reasons besides just drinking that the water like looking at the text that water on the moon could be helpful ","wait um so teacher i didn't i didn't write the microscope or the lunar orbiter in mine so i guess i don't know what's wrong with my answer or how to fix my answer "
20532,410.3,Chris,,"you know there's actually very little water really on the moon ","um i guess you're seeing that the it wasn't a lot of water but i guess well i got mine from a paragraph and it saysum they found water water that can be found deep within the moon's polar craters and if i go swimming and in the deep in the deep end of the pool that's not a lot more water "
20537,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah i guess "
20539,150.1,Oliver,,,"i'm sorry but it's time for us to go so we'll see you later "
20542,150.1,Oliver,,,"hello "
20544,120.2,Luis,,"um so i know that we just talked about this question right what equipment and scientists use discover water on the moon and student ","um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20546,150.1,Luis,,"so even if you know all about space right i think it's still useful to be able to read articles like this and find evidence for questions that we're trying to answer so hopefully you'll still get something out of this class today does that sound okay ","that sounds okay "
20549,230.3,Luis,,"and so student why don't we actually start with you i noticed that you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks is that right ","yeah yeah that's my answer "
20551,120.3,Luis,,"okay i'm wondering if you can read the question out loud for me can you do that ","question asked what he did scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
20555,210.3,Luis,,"you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tank is not the equipment that they use to discover the water on the moon ","um well yeah because if there's astronauts up on the mon discovering water they definitely have oxygen tanks 100 "
20560,420.3,Luis,,"and maybe check back in with the text and see if we can. ","um okay um So what should I do next. "
20563,120.3,Luis,,"so would you mind reading the text for me and seeing if using something different at the end ","yeah i'll do that "
20565,120.4,Jazmin,,"great um well student doing that student can i ask you about your answer ","yes "
20570,420.2,Jazmin,,"i'm wondering if you also can get a little bit more specific so what were they sending the small machines for ","to watch a final water i don't understand why my answer is wrong out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two. "
20572,120.3,Jazmin,,"oh awesome do you want to go back to paragraph two with me really quick can you read that first sentence for me ","nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter to investigate "
20575,420.2,Jazmin,,"well i think your answers right there right so you said nasa send a small machine i would include the rest of that sentence in your answer so what was that small machine called ","lunar orbiter "
20579,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that sound right ","yeah yes that sounds right so i just add the name and then my answer is done "
20582,150.1,Jazmin,,"yeah i think so what do you think ","great yeah "
20584,150.1,Jazmin,,"that feel like a little bit more of a complete answer to you ","yeah yeah i think it makes my answer more complete yeah just like you said "
20587,310.1,Chris,,"awesome thanks for looking back at the text for me ","yeah it's so cool "
20591,210.3,Chris,,"do you think that your answer answers that question ","oh what a scientist use to discover well well so i'm actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20595,210.4,Chris,,"and i know they might have used a lot of other equipment to get there right but was there a specific piece of equipment that helped them make that discovery ","well i mean the thing student was talking about sounded pretty good "
20598,210.4,Chris,,"yeah can you remind me what that was called ","okay yeah i'm "
20600,210.4,Chris,,"awesome yeah was that what they used to discover the ice as a water ","um well i guess so "
20603,150.1,Chris,,"equipment is the answer to the question does that sound good ","yeah yeah that would be good "
20606,230.3,Oliver,,"and while they're talking student and student i noticed you class circle the same thing is that right ","yeah yeah we saw the same thing on the microscope "
20611,410.2,Oliver,,"what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon you class found the equipment that they would use to look at what they discovered right but it feels like we skipped the discover step somewhere in there ","well how come you discover something after you can't see it "
20616,310.1,Oliver,,"that told us how they were able to discover it so i had the same question when i was reading it right i was thinking how did they find it they can't even see it ","okay yeah sure "
20619,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say um it really matters a lot but you listen to every one of our answers and gave each one of us advice about how to make it more specific i really felt like you really listen to each of us so thank you so much "
20621,310.1,Luis,,,"me "
20623,310.1,Oliver,,,"hi "
20626,310.1,Luis,,,"um yeah so i just have this this quick kind of question and mostly it's just because um well okay so i kind of already know everything there is to know about space already so i don't think i need to be in this class "
20629,150.1,Luis,,"you class read the the article about water on the moon is that correct ","yeah we read that "
20633,120.4,Farrah,,"and we're circling evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question so student can you tell me what you thought on what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","so my my answer was that i thought that they use they would need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so i believe that they use the microscope to find the water "
20635,210.4,Farrah,,"okay um in the text what did they what were they using the microscope for ","well they were using it to see because the water were these i think the word microscopic type like little ice crystals they couldn't see it with just like the naked eye so they had to see it in the microscope because it was so small "
20639,210.3,Jazmin,,"um did they discover the water with the microscope or did they find something else to find the sort of source of the water ","um so i guess i was just confused because actually i feel like i answered this question so i was kind of wondering like why my answer was wrong or like not correct because i i think i had an answer to this question but i guess i'm not sure "
20641,230.3,Jazmin,,"oh student okay i'm just looking at your answer right now so student you said that nasa sent a small machine is that correct ","yeah "
20643,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay so nasa send a small machine what was that machine called ","it was the lunar orbiter "
20645,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah and what was the purpose of that machine so we had a small machine it was called the lunar orbiter what did it do what was the purpose of it ","i thought the lunar orbiter was what found the water like that's to me like when i read that that that text really closely it looks like they use the lunar orbiter like maybe a sensor or something on it to find the water "
20648,230.3,Chris,,"student um you said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon right ","yeah that's yeah that's what i said "
20651,210.4,Oliver,,"okay so when the scientist on the water we talked about that one word that was in the article that we read um that describes the water can someone tell me what that word was again there was one word that described the water how how much water there was yeah student ","um well it said that there was um well first off that the water was microscopic so like you could only see it through a microscope but they also said that there wasn't very much like they were talking about how they were taking the glass and measuring the water and there was only like very little water in the like i think it was like a ton of dirt or something "
20655,210.4,Chris,,"um so they found a very small amount of water right like um they found a very like a microscopic amount of water that they needed to use the microscopes then to look at right ","i guess i guess i was just wondering like i know cuz i went to nasa with my dad that astronauts use like equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits kind of like what student was saying and i guess i'm confused because i added that to my paper because it seemed like they were missing that in the reading it didn't mention it and it seems like that would be really important "
20660,230.2,Chris,,"um so what in the article um made you think of oxygen tanks? ","well the fact that they were on the moon and the fact that basically like there's no oxygen on the moon for them to breathe so i was like well if they're going around with the microscope and the lunar orbiter and all this stuff like they better have oxygen tanks because otherwise they can't hold the microscope up to the to the ice you know "
20665,110.1,Oliver,,"definitely um yeah student ","um so unfortunately i know it was a really short time but we really enjoyed working with you but it's time for us to go to lunch and again i know it's a really short time but i really wanted to thank you for working with us because i think that we all really appreciate the way that you asked us to really look back at the text and to clarify our answers and you were really you like really valued what we had to say so i think right class like i think class felt like um like you are really listening to us so thank you so much because that was really cool was really fun thank you "
20668,110.1,All,,,"hi "
20670,110.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah so i don't think i have to be in this class because i already corrected my answer i changed my answer to scientists found ice using a small machine "
20679,520.1,Farrah,,"or even thinking beyond today what are some tools that we can use for future texts like these ","oh yeah absolutely so what i said in the first one was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really close "
20684,230.1,Farrah,,"okay um so student can you explain are your what were you thinking on when you came to that answer ","yeah so i was thinking that basically like okay so it says what equipment did the scientists right and i was like okay so i'm gonna find equipment and i found that my personal and i thought this is definitely the right equipment because how could they find the water which they said was tiny microscopic and then like how could they find the water if they couldn't see it so that was kind of my thinking "
20690,230.1,Farrah,,,"i just wanted to say that it was great the first time but i also added some details of the meeting i said that scientists used me she called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon okay thank you for that student i'm i'm glad that you were able to revise your answer as well um so i student really quick i just wanted to go back to student for a little bit just to ask um student what was your revised answer so what i said when i revised it was that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water craters on the moon i ended up with the same answer "
20695,230.3,Jazmin,,"how great so you class have the same answer in the end that they use the lunar orbiter ","it was actually okay so i knew in the first and today i said that the scientists sentence small machine but i realized that i looked up the name of the machine and then i realized after listening to them and student talk about how small the water was that like microscopic i thought that the best answer would include like what they were like so like they said the lunar orbiter and like what they sent it to you so that seemed like that was the right answer "
20697,530.1,Jazmin,,"okay um so when you're thinking about your original answer and your new answer what do you think the difference is between those answers ","well i think the main thing that i i added with detail like first i added the detail of the of the object so i didn't just say like kind of what it was i said like specifically what was it that makes sense "
20700,530.1,Jazmin,,,"also like basically i i added detail about like what they were discovering because i just said the sense that the small machine but but there's more to the answer because it's saying like what you know what equipment did they said to discover and i thought like well it's an even better answer says what he said "
20704,520.1,Chris,,"yes so when we're thinking about answering questions like these later in the future i think that what you said about details is very important ","well i was just i actually had a question i just heard what student and student said and it made me think i had a question so the water that the scientists found was it was microscopic like it wasn't like a lot of water it was just tiny water "
20710,210.4,Oliver,,"the ice deposits in the moon were very small right so we can tell that um it said in the text and didn't it say can someone actually answer this for me in the text when we were reading it um what did it say anything about the amount of water that was on the moon ","i remember because i was i was what i was seeing that it said that there were only 32 ounces of water in a ton of the top layer like the dirt on the moon and so they said that was just four glasses of water like in a ton of dirt which is a lot of dirt "
20716,210.4,Farrah,,"why did they need a microscope why do they need a microscope what was the the property of the water that made them need to use a microscope yeah student ","oh i would love to answer but we have to go to our next class but i just wanted to thank you so much for working with this this was really fun thank you bye "
20721,210.4,Luis,,,"um yeah so i got this all figured out so i think i'm good to go "
20723,230.1,Luis,,"can you tell me um what do you have figured out can you explain that to me ","yeah so okay so my initial answer when i didn't know was scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and stuff like that but then after we work together and i actually looked at the reading and all this stuff i said okay scientists found ice using a small machine "
20726,230.3,Luis,,"okay student so you said i'm scientist use a small machine right um so ","yeah they found ice using a small machine "
20736,420.2,Luis,,"student i'm going to have you look at the text for a second and try to come up with an answer that's a little bit more detailed ","what was the machine well the machine was on the you know the the rocket ship the thing you call it "
20738,420.2,Luis,,,"i got it okay it's the lunar orbit "
20740,120.4,Luis,,"yes it's the lunar orbiter so um can you restate your answer for me now that we have that information can you restate your answer to that initial question ","yeah okay so i would say that my revised answer is a scientist found ice using a lunar orbiter "
20743,530.1,Luis,,"yes so that use the lunar orbiter so student what on what exactly made you come to that conclusion that new answer that you have ","well okay so you said that i needed to use details in the answer and so when i went and looked back in the in the reading i saw that the small machine was actually called the lunar orbiter like it wasn't a rocket ship but i mean it is a rocket ship but it's also like that's the actual name for it so that's what that seemed like the answer to be "
20752,150.1,Luis,,"so make sense student ","yeah so like i should make sure that i i guess like look closely at the reading is that is that is that right "
20756,420.3,Luis,,"so maybe not literally looking very close at the reading but you definitely want to make sure that you're doing a close reading you're looking at the language that they're using certain words that might be important and using that to answer the question ","yeah okay that actually makes a lot of sense so okay i think i understand "
20762,120.4,Farrah,,"great great job student um student i wanted to touch base with you um again i asked for your initial response um but can you please tell me what your revised response was ","oh yeah sure so my revised response was that students use the orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water on the moon Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use. but then i realized after we had class together that actually the lunar orbiter was but discovered the water so i realized that i had to read the question really close and because i was focused on the finding the equipment not on what the equipment was doing because the question wasn't like how did scientists study the water it was how did they discover the water that so that was really different and once i realized that i realized i have to look really closely at the question like what it was asking "
20764,310.1,Oliver,,"that's great student and i'm glad that you were able to really think deeply about how you were answering that question and what you can do moving forward that's fantastic and student you have your hand raised before ","well i was just gonna say that i think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool "
20770,120.4,Chris,,"student i want to or student you had your hand raised also can can you tell me what you were thinking ","yeah absolutely so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to thank you and i in particular i really wanted to thank you for working with us like you really helped us to understand like what we needed to think about in terms of our strategy so we were able to like think about how we found our answers and i never thought about that but it was really useful so i honestly right class like i found it really useful to like have the time to really think about like okay so how did i even come up with my answer because i come up with some pretty good answer but i never thought about like how did i come up with that so thank you so much "
20772,120.4,Farrah,,,"oh nice to meet you teacher oh we're doing great we're really excited for your class "
20774,120.4,Luis,,,"um yeah well i just i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20778,150.1,Luis,,"so i think we're all here just to support each other's learning and understanding each other's perspective so thanks for raising that student ","okay okay "
20781,140.1,Luis,,"awesome thanks student okay so first briefly before we you know tackle your guys's responses i wanted to know just by raise of hands who would love to go to the moon someday ","definitely want to go to the moon i want to be an astronaut so bad "
20784,140.1,Luis,,"student why do you want to go to the moon ","oh man well what just be such a cool experience to feel like zero gravity up there i can't wait i really want to go to space camp because you get to kind of try it out like almost before you get to be an astronaut and i want to discover new planets and galaxies too "
20786,140.1,Jazmin,,"absolutely me too so you know some of you didn't raise your hand so why wouldn't you want to go to the moon if class wants to share ","yes i can share "
20788,140.1,Jazmin,,,"well i'm really just more passionate about the earth and saving the earth and and i really think we should focus on this planet the one that we have in the one that we're living on and saving it while we live here "
20790,110.1,Jazmin,,"really great and would you mind sharing with me is your name pronounced hosni or student ","student "
20794,110.1,Jazmin,,"thanks for thanks student i appreciate that ","see i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20799,230.1,Jazmin,,"can you share more about what you mean by that by scientists spent or sent a small machine ","yes okay well i found that in our in our story in reading and in part two it said necessary the small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
20804,140.1,Farrah,,"each okay well um you know the word for what is the word for moon in french do you know ","it's something we can like lune "
20807,210.4,Luis,,"so when we think about lunar as like an adjective as a descriptive word that's like basically of the moon and then does class know the definition of orbiter or orbit can class share that with me ","oh yeah up i got this one i bought this one we talked about it on orbit means to like on to go around something like the planets orbit the sun because we go around it "
20811,210.4,Farrah,,"not on the moon surface how do you class imagine that it actually was able to analyze dirt on the moon if it's above the ground essentially does class know that student ","well i guess i don't know i guess that's my question because i thought the answer was the microscope but if it's not on the moon how can they get a microscope there and look at the little water particles "
20813,130.1,Chris,,"exactly right and you know what you were onto something with your microscope response because by the way that is a really essential part of analyzing the dirt on the moon however the microscope is not how we got the dirt to analyze student what's up ","oh well i just wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20822,210.4,Farrah,,"which is where they're based basically able to take that dirt and analyze the dirt where they found that there's a 5 water content in that dirt so that's where the microscope comes into play ","that microscopes not on the moon "
20827,210.4,Oliver,,"you know to chris's point utilize you know the oxygen equipment because it wasn't actually astronauts that were on the surface of the moon collecting that dirt it was the lunar orbiter the equipment and the student what's up ","i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say when you just told us about how the lunar orbiter works that was that was so interesting and i wish the story told us that because i think i think i would have been a lot more excited if i knew about the throwing of the stuff in the and the smoke bloom and all of that stuff so thank you for teaching us that "
20830,210.4,Farrah,,,"hi hello "
20832,210.4,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're excited to work with you "
20835,150.1,Luis,,"i'm so pleased to work with you today i always learned so much from each of you so i wanted to let you know so why we're here so based on the responses and i i've identified some areas that i think that we can revisit the text together to just really strengthen our understanding ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20843,150.1,Luis,,"and based on the responses that each of you provided i do think that there are some areas which i've identified where we can revisit and strengthen your understanding about space about the moon and about water on the moon that sound okay ","um yeah okay "
20848,120.4,Oliver,,"yeah go ahead Oliver. ","um the question is asking what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon "
20851,120.4,Farrah,,"student would you mind sharing with us what your response was ","yeah okay i said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20854,230.1,Farrah,,"okay yeah that's all right so let's can you maybe clarify your statement for me certainly a microscope is involved in analyzing water crystals on the moon but could you just clarify why you provided that response ","yeah okay so in part three they say the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they have to use the microscope to discover it otherwise they can't see it "
20863,210.3,Jazmin,,"some of these texts are pretty pretty dense pretty complex if we only read them once what could be the consequence of that how that ","well if you only read it once like you might not remember everything by the time you get to the end you might forget the beginning "
20868,510.1,Chris,,"so when we're not drawing on our prior knowledge these things can be complex and reviewing them a couple times is important ","yeah well i didn't go to space but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20871,210.4,Chris,,"oh my gosh yes you're absolutely right so ","oh no no i didn't know that part till i read the story "
20873,120.4,Chris,,"got it got it and student would you mind sharing with us your response to question one ","yeah i said i'm scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20879,120.4,Oliver,,"student go ahead ","um yeah so um they said it's microscopic um they also said it's ice "
20883,230.3,Oliver,,"so you know i think that also brings back the point of you know if we you know only read a text or we read it quickly we may not catch all of these really fine details i also wanted to you know switch over to oh go ahead ","oh yeah um before we keep going um i want to let you know actually it's time for us to go "
20886,230.3,Farrah,,,"good thanks for asking "
20889,150.1,Luis,,"i brought you here because i would love to discuss with you your responses to some of the questions after we read our article about water on the moon yes student ","yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20896,150.1,Luis,,"does class understand that ","um yeah okay yeah "
20902,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay well oh yeah go ahead student ","and it's it's asking us to find an equipment "
20907,120.4,Farrah,,"Excellent, Farrah, could you read us what your response was to question number one, please. ","okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
20909,230.1,Farrah,,"okay well how about if you just clarify for us to be in it you tell me why you believe that your answers right okay does that sound okay ","well okay they said the waters microscopic on so how can you discover something that's microscopic without a microscope "
20914,430.1,Farrah,,"we were looking for the machine that they used really to get after to analyze the soil in the first place so can you look back at the text to identify this machine and then answer what that piece of equipment was ","i don't know yet "
20921,120.4,Chris,,"so um i would like for student please if you would mind sharing what your response was that would be great ","okay i've said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20927,210.3,Chris,,"so student we'd love for you to share with us if you if you would um how water exists on the moon differently than it does on earth do you happen to know the answer to that ","Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon. "
20932,120.4,Luis,,"student ","yeah okay student so the water on the moon it's not like water like a pool or like an ocean um it's like this tiny tiny little tiny little pieces of water tiny little pieces of ice you can't even see them "
20937,230.3,Chris,,"farrahs point about the microscope where you're going to need a microscope to look at the soil ","yeah we'll talk about that like the microscope and stuff um i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
20940,140.1,Chris,,"yes that is you're absolutely right and and why student do we need oxygen if we're going to be in space or on the moon for that matter ","well yeah for people to breathe for the astronauts to breathe "
20944,210.4,Oliver,,"can class share with me what water can be broken down into this was in the article yep go ahead student ","on i really wish we could keep going but it's time for us to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say thank you so much for reminding us to read the text on more than once so that we can understand all the details i think that's going to be really helpful next time "
20947,210.4,Farrah,,,"hello oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
20953,120.2,Luis,,"okay um so what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um excuse me yeah yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
20955,110.3,Luis,,"oh then you can explain to your classmate then before you leave then ","okay that sounds good "
20961,120.2,Farrah,,"so does class know what equipment they use for discover the water in the moon ","okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
20964,120.4,Chris,,"and student you had the hands on i guess you can tell me why you think ","okay so my answer is um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
20967,120.4,Jazmin,,"well who else student you had a answer also when ","i said that nasa send a small machine "
20970,120.4,Oliver,,"student you had a question you had answer also ","um yeah so i circled the same thing as some fan oh okay "
20973,120.4,Luis,,"so so student what are you what's what you have in your mind then ","okay um i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
20987,230.3,Jazmin,,"and as student was saying small small machine to see the particle and then find the water in the moon yes ","yes so well what about my answer nasa to small machine i don't understand why my answer is wrong cuz i thought if we were in this class our answer was wrong so "
20993,110.4,Jazmin,,"so the answer for student was correct one right ","so how did they use that machine though because they talked about that too didn't they use that to investigate "
20999,210.4,Chris,,"very scientific tool to ","yeah so since we're talking about equipment um i wanted to say i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks like student said but also on masks and suits "
21004,210.4,Chris,,"yeah so that's quite i mean they use a lot of tools and then my my machine and then microscope or those still thanks to particle to find a water on them ","yeah i i bet they need a lot of different tools to to find the water probably probably more than one right "
21008,130.3,Chris,,"and then one of them is a microscope to look at it closely to find a water ","right yeah because you said well that the craters you said they're not full of water like i thought right because the water is so small "
21011,110.1,Oliver,,"that's good ","um i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the text even better today it was really nice to meet you and work with you "
21014,110.1,Chris,,,"hi hi teacher "
21017,120.2,Luis,,"ok now so hello you the question you you answer the question about what equipment did a scientists use to discover water on the moon right yes student ","yeah okay um excuse me teacher yes i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21019,110.1,Luis,,"really ","ya "
21021,230.1,Luis,,"okay did the scientists found the moon i mean water in the moon ","yes they did "
21025,230.1,Luis,,"how much ","okay i don't know that no i didn't really read it cuz i figured i already knew everything so "
21029,110.3,Luis,,"or at the same time or you can help other classmate who they may not have on ","okay okay "
21034,120.4,Chris,,"student what what was your answer ","um i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
21037,130.3,Chris,,"okay um that's good they found the water but how much i don't think we they didn't find it full a lot of water ","they didn't "
21041,130.2,Farrah,,"no does class can answer the how much water they found ","my in my section is said it was microscopic um so that means that it was really really small amount of water "
21043,110.4,Chris,,"yes i think we today you need to see microscope so it is very small amount they found the water or i think student ","okay well in the part that i've read it said that they found the water deep in the moon's polar craters and when i go swimming in the deep part of the pool there's more water in the deep part of the pool than in the shallow part of the pool "
21046,130.3,Chris,,"yes yeah it's true when you go swimming you go you have to go through in the deep water so that you know you have fun but what they don't they they found in deep location in the moon not in the deep water they went to the ","okay. "
21049,110.2,Jazmin,,"you can look your answers are there you are correct they had water ","i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21052,120.4,Oliver,,"your answer what was your answer ","i said nasa sent a small machine i think your answer is wrong because me and student have the right answer the microscope is the right answer "
21062,120.4,Chris,,"what was your right answer was student ","i think the microscope is the right answer but the teacher didn't say that you had the right answer student well i think that we're right and you're wrong well i don't know that's why i asked the teacher oh well it's i got it right out of the story well i mean you didn't actually say the name of the machine student i said the microscope is the name i think that jazmin's one is right because um in in the part where it talks about the microscope it says that they're looking at the water in in in jazmin's section it says that they're investigating and i think investigating is closer to um what's the word in the question oh discover i think investigate this closer to discover than looking at something also i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21064,130.3,Chris,,"oh yeah but i don't think they this time they sended those kinda equipment equipment because on the moon they just um yeah they use those kind of equipment in time to time for different for different researches but not this time i don't think ","well they need them to breathe on the moon "
21069,210.3,Chris,,"do they go to the moon the astronauts or is it the machine was sent to moon what do you think student ","oh i don't know i just thought the astronauts went to the moon but i guess in the story well it says scientists scientists have found evidence "
21072,130.3,Chris,,"yeah scientists found the evidence but scientists found the evidence but it doesn't mean that science went there to find it the machine could be sended there and then found the thing right ","oh i didn't think about that "
21077,130.3,Oliver,,"they went sent the machine to put the moon and then they found some water right yes student ","um teacher it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for what you said to student at helping me think about looking more closely at the story to try to understand more of the details of the story "
21079,130.3,Oliver,,,"hi hello how are you doing "
21081,130.3,Oliver,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you "
21085,150.1,Luis,,"so you class just got done with reading the moon is a desert ","yeah yeah but i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21088,120.4,Luis,,"so you when we went through and circled the evidence from the text about what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon what did you say again student ","um well i sat at scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
21091,210.3,Luis,,"when we were thinking about what we were what scientists were using specifically to find water though do you think that there's anything else that maybe they could have used that wasn't oxygen tanks ","um i mean there's probably some other staff what i know that if there are astronauts on the moon they definitely have oxygen tanks "
21097,120.1,Farrah,,"um do you student or any of our other friends do you class know where can you class look at your texts and see if you can find anything else about ","well i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because in the story and said that the water they found was microscopic "
21100,110.2,Farrah,,"yeah they that is exactly what the story said and that was a really good observation ","well i don't know because i thought it was the microscope because how can you find something if it's too small to see "
21103,120.3,Jazmin,,"you know what student that's a great point can we all look at our text and look at the second paragraph ","yeah i found my answer and the second paragraph and i said that nasa to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is from "
21108,110.2,Oliver,,"student your answer is completely correct you're totally right when you said that nasa a small machine ","okay second paragraph right we're student was talking about at sas nasa simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
21113,130.1,Farrah,,"you're right student when you said that they need to find they would need to use a microscope because the water was microscopic they probably did have to use a microscope but that's not necessarily what they were using to find to discover that water right ","okay so you're saying they had to use this orbiter to find the water before they could see it "
21116,130.1,Farrah,,,"oh okay well that's really cool but how how could i have figured that out on my own like without jazmin's help "
21123,130.1,Chris,,,"oh well i i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like even said but also on masks and suits "
21128,110.3,Luis,,"but they definitely if there are astronauts on the moon they're definitely going to need things like those big helmets and their space suits and oxygen tanks, those are super important for people if they're going up in space. ","okay so there's no astronauts hmm um yeah i just looked at that story student and it doesn't even say anything about astronauts actually "
21137,210.4,Oliver,,"and they have been able to send those things in space instead of just people ","i'm i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us think about the words in the story that we're like the word discover because i really thought it was a microscope but when you put it that way it really made a lot more sense why it was the lunar orbiter so thank you so much "
21142,150.1,Luis,,"so we just read the water on the moon passage in class right ","um excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21145,150.1,Luis,,"but we are talking about the moon specifically today and i just want to go over a couple of our response questions that we can make sure we all understand the vocabulary that we learned in this lesson and we can all be on the same page does that sound good ","yeah okay "
21148,140.1,Luis,,"do you know anything that's super fun about space what's your favorite space fact ","okay um that there's no gravity in space you know so like if you go there you can kind of almost like fly like a superhero "
21150,140.1,Luis,,"yeah student do you know anything else about the moon ","um not really about the moon no "
21153,140.1,Chris,,"what about class else does class else in our class know anything specific about the moon that we didn't read in our activity ","yeah i know that they're doing a lot of work to try to see if the moon could be inhabitable or if they can study some of the geology on the moon to see how we can use it to help us here on earth "
21155,110.3,Chris,,"yeah that's very true student i like the vocabulary word geology you used could you tell our friends what the word geology means because you could you help us figure out what that word means ","yeah geology is like the study of rocks "
21162,120.4,Farrah,,"and i wanted to check in and see what evidence you class circled maybe you class could give me the number that you circled in our readings for where you found that answer ","um i found mine in paragraph one i found mine in paragraph two um me too mine was in paragraph three "
21165,210.2,Luis,,"when we think of the word discover what does that word mean can we think about what maybe it means to discover something ","um so like when they discover new planet it's like they find out that it's there they they find it or yeah something like that. "
21170,210.2,Jazmin,,"i want us to think about what equipment like what things did scientists use to find water on the moon right we want to make sure we are thinking about how they found it specifically ","yeah um so i think that's why i picked the answer from paragraph two so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
21172,120.3,Jazmin,,"student or student that was a great point could you read out the part in paragraph to that you thought gave you your answer ","yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter line at the south pole and look for ice deposits and a large polar crater "
21176,110.2,Jazmin,,"awesome student thank you so much so you said that nasa sent a small machine which is very true and that's exactly what we were looking for ","yeah it's called the lunar orbiter "
21180,210.3,Farrah,,"yeah so um i love that you class were thinking about them that equipment because that is an important tool but were they using it the microscope to find it or to look at it ","well i know they were using it to look at it because that's exactly what it says in the answer um oh if they were using it to find it on i don't know "
21183,210.4,Oliver,,"you don't know so i'm going to read you class paragraph three and then i would love to hear you class i would love to hear if you class think that the microscope was used to help find it or maybe to discover it ","okay well in paragraph three they do use the word found it says all water they found was microscopic "
21185,210.4,Oliver,,"yes that is very true so that the word microscopic is a little bit different than the word microscope right so the water they found is super tiny and if they want to see it they would need to look really close with a microscope right ","oh okay okay "
21188,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah so if i was going to if we were going to completely start over and i was going to ask you class what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon what would you class tell me ","um i guess i'd use jazmin's idea uh the lunar orbiter "
21190,120.4,Chris,,"student what about you ","um you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use of lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21192,120.1,Chris,,"yes um what what about the paragraph that or the sentence that student helped us find in paragraph to do you think you could look at that and then maybe think again about what specific equipment that the lunar that the scientists are using ","okay yeah um so it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
21194,210.4,Chris,,"the lunar orbiter and what did that lunar orbiter do student ","it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
21197,150.1,Oliver,,"yes and that's how they found the water on there right ","yeah oh cuz ice yeah sorry teacher i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later okay "
21199,150.1,Chris,,,"bye teacher "
21201,150.1,Chris,,,"hi teacher i'm good "
21204,120.2,Luis,,"so i want to focus on the second discussion question um so the can is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
21207,120.4,Luis,,"can you tell me what your answer is too is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","yeah so i said water can be split up into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
21210,310.1,Oliver,,"Yes, so Luis I see how you got that from our text and you focused on our fifth paragraph and talked about what what water is made up of ","um valuable is like when something costs a lot of money "
21214,230.1,Luis,,"so um student you were talking about the parts of water hydrogen and oxygen why are hydrogen and oxygen helpful what makes those things valuable ","um okay cuz you know like accident we gotta breathe man we need oxygen to breathe so that automatically it's like really valuable cuz we'll die "
21216,230.1,Luis,,,"hydrogen i don't know i mean i don't know we learned that it's a gas but i don't know what we use it for "
21224,120.4,Jazmin,,"student i would love for you to tell us why what you found in the fifth paragraph ","okay so um in the fifth paragraph it says that like rocket fuel helps spacecrafts to move and the moon can serve as a stop for spacecrafts but i don't i'm still confused "
21229,210.4,Luis,,"so friends what about other than just helping astronauts breathe what else can hydrogen and oxygen be used for ","okay i heard this one and so it can like help spacecrafts to move like fuel "
21232,210.4,Chris,,"um student and student and student you class read the fourth paragraph right what did you class think could be useful there are what did that tell you about the water ","okay well it says that the astronauts could drink the water um and it says it's the water is heavy i mean i already had that part in my answer "
21235,210.4,Farrah,,,"well i didn't have either of those so i guess i could see how they could drink the water and that'd be important maybe they'd have like a water fountain up there or something "
21243,210.4,Farrah,,"do you class think it would be helpful if we already had if we didn't have to make rocket fuel here and take it up take extra up with us do you think it'd be helpful to have it on the moon already too ","yeah okay um i started out thinking well in the future it will be valuable as well it's in the right now it won't be valuable because it's not ready yet um but now i'm thinking that maybe if they can get on of water then they could like have something to drink and they could like make fuel up there too "
21245,210.4,Chris,,"What do we did we learn about water is it super light and easy, can I carry a bunch of water around super easily. ","no so we know that it's heavy you know what teacher i was reading that through could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
21251,140.1,Oliver,,"no way student that's so cool would you class like to go to the moon ","yeah yeah man i would love to go to the moon i don't know about class yeah yeah we would yeah Okay um well I started out thinking, but there wasn't gonna be there's no way that we're gonna have any water on the moon so that's not valuable, but now I think I think that they might be able to make it happen um and so part. "
21253,230.1,Oliver,,"i would love to hear a little bit more about what do you think what different ways could we use water why is it valuable ","okay um and it's it's it's valuable cuz we could drink it on the moon and we can make fuel on the moon and um it's really heavy to carry so then they won't have to carry it on the spaceship "
21258,150.1,Oliver,,"do you class have anything else that you think that hasn't already been shared by student and student that you think that is super exciting that you think now that you didn't understand before ","um actually teacher oh something that is super exciting is that it's time for lunch but i wanted to say thank you for asking some questions about like how my thinking um it's kind of changed because i guess i wasn't really thinking about like what all those other parts of the story but since you were asking us all those questions now i realized that there's a lot more information on that i kind of missed in the story "
21261,150.1,Jazmin,,,"bye "
21265,150.1,Luis,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you "
21267,150.1,Luis,,"awesome i'm really excited to work with you all to my name is teacher you can call me teacher if you'd like um and i wanted to get right into discussing the passage that you class read yes student ","um yeah teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21270,110.3,Luis,,"oh well student that's awesome because you know what i had to do a little bit of research myself to learn about space and so maybe since you're here in this class ","oh yeah that sounds great i would love to "
21274,120.4,Chris,,"amazing all right well i was just wondering if class wanted to share just their thoughts on the text what did you think about it were you interested in learning about water on the moon is it something that maybe isn't your favorite subject any any thoughts um let's see student ","yeah she thought it was amazing that they found these craters full of water on the moon i never imagined there being water up there it is so cool "
21281,210.4,Chris,,"based on what you read could you maybe tell me how they found the water what did they use to find the water ","um i uh huh "
21285,210.4,Chris,,"a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar crater and these ice deposits are very small so based on those couple of sentences student what do you can you tell me what the name of the equipment they used was ","um well i think the name i heard was um listen we're better "
21287,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah student that's exactly right so that is the machine they send actually was called the l cross mission but they sent a space to try and discover where the water was on the moon awesome thank you for sharing that with me student that was a great job let's see student ","okay so i said something different i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21291,230.3,Oliver,,"and you know i think deb also had a similar response right death ","i saw the same thing about the microscope "
21297,150.1,Oliver,,"do you understand the difference ","well how can you find something if you can't see it "
21302,210.4,Oliver,,"that is where they found the hydrogen and where they found the water but do you see how they needed that lunar orbiter in order to put that piece inside the crater and then they use the to look even closer and see how much water they bound ","wow reach every reader thats so cool "
21305,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah right and but seeing student you said you know so much about space i was wondering if you could share a little bit about your your answer to the question and then dead i'll get to you right after student okay ","um yeah so i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks because if they're scientists up on the moon they definitely need oxygen tanks for sure "
21307,210.4,Jazmin,,"mm hmm and that's what scientists definitely need oxygen tanks because even what is oxygen and help us do we need oxygen to what ","to breathe "
21311,210.4,Chris,,"are you hearing person what is water made up of ","water is h two o "
21313,210.4,Chris,,"that's right h2o does class know what he stands for ","yeah yeah it's hydrogen then the always oxygen because when i i went to nasa and i saw lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment "
21318,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense to student ","ah um yeah i can see that "
21323,120.4,Oliver,,"all right dad i'm so sorry for keeping you waiting what would you like to share ","what okay um i just had a quick question because all that stuff about the plume of dust and everything that's really cool but i don't know how i want to know that i'm otherwise like if you didn't tell us i think what i'm still a microscope because i didn't know any of that "
21330,150.1,Oliver,,"so when you think about it that way does it make a little bit more sense that the answer would be the lunar orbiter ","okay yeah i'm starting to see the arm oh oh i just looked at the clock on so sorry we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how the lunar orbiter works and how the question works to that was so helpful when you helped us see the difference between finding the water and seeing a water thank you so much for teaching us today "
21332,150.1,Farrah,,,"hello "
21334,150.1,Farrah,,,"we're so excited to work with you "
21337,150.1,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21340,110.3,Luis,,"and that's amazing because you know what if then i'm thinking that maybe because you know so much about space already you can kind of be almost like an expert for us today and for our lesson ","that sounds great "
21343,140.1,Farrah,,"alright so first i was wondering what did class think about the passage that we read about water on the moon is class have any thoughts or any ideas about what they read let's see student ","well um i just found it surprising that there was water on the moon i never thought about that before so i was very surprised "
21346,150.1,Chris,,"student or student i know you also had had your hands up was there something that you either one of you wanted to share ","oh yeah well i sort of like student it really blew my mind that there was all this water on the moon like these craters full of water oh it's so cool to picture and i really want to go and see it one day "
21357,120.4,Jazmin,,"ok so now that giving you that time would class like to share what words to use circle that you think are the best words that will help you answer the question ","and i said he is the most important word would be and discover "
21360,120.2,Jazmin,,"that is a great word that will help us answer the question and said what equipment was used to discover water on the moon great student thank you ","yeah and so i'm just wondering because i know that's the question and my answer was nasa send a small machine and x equipment and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21367,110.1,Jazmin,,"i think that let's see what some other of your classmates circled as well but i do think that your answer made complete sense when i was reading over the question ","thank you "
21370,120.4,Chris,,"all right let's go student what did you circle ","okay so um well i circled equipment because well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits so i picked equipment "
21375,120.4,Farrah,,"all right let's move our last one student what did you circle ","okay well i circled two is that okay "
21377,120.4,Farrah,,,"i circled it equipment just like student and i also circled water "
21384,510.1,Oliver,,"it's important for you to look back at the passage to try and determine what the best answer to the question is it's always helpful to circle keywords in the question ","um well actually we have to oh i just looked at the clock but thank you for teaching us this strategy today oh "
21388,510.1,Farrah,,,"we're great we're really excited to meet you "
21390,150.1,Chris,,"i'm really excited to meet you class too and i'm also really excited to talk about this reading i'm a science teacher so i thought this was super cool did you class read anything that you thought was interesting in that passage ","yeah i i thought it was so amazing how how the scientists they found craters full of water on the moon "
21392,110.1,Luis,,"yeah that was wild student class else read something that i thought was interesting ","um yeah well excuse me um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21395,140.1,Luis,,"what's your favorite thing about space student ","oh my oh wow oh that's really hard um i think my favorite thing about space as how um pluto used to be a planet and then they said it was a dwarf planet it's not even a planet "
21400,120.4,Farrah,,"your guys's responses for what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon i'm wondering if class could share out one of the tools that they remember reading about ","okay i said you need a scientific tool called him microscope to look really closely "
21402,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah and why did the scientists day to be able to look so closely in this case does class remember reading that ","yeah i remember "
21404,210.4,Oliver,,,"yeah well okay um i still felt the same as student for the answer and the reason they need the microscope as because the water well actually it's ice and it's really really really small like you can't even see it if you don't have a microscope "
21406,130.2,Jazmin,,"mm hmm yeah so i'm wondering if class can help us dive a little bit deeper into this were there any other tools that the scientist needed for this mission other than a microscope that we just heard student and student talk about a little bit yeah student ","okay well i said nasa send a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21408,210.4,Jazmin,,"well let's get a little bit deeper into that what was the job of that machine once it actually got to the moon yeah student you can ","yeah i think it said he investigated and then it found the ice deposits in the polar crater "
21411,130.2,Luis,,"so how to do that student either you can answer or maybe student or student could help you out with that ","um i i i didn't oh okay well i'm my answer is oxygen tanks i said oxygen tanks "
21415,230.2,Luis,,"okay so even were in the passage do you hear them talking about oxygen tanks ","yeah that's something i didn't i didn't really read this one but it's just not because i already know so much about space i just knew that the equipment was oxygen tanks cuz how can you go to the moon without "
21419,210.4,Jazmin,,"what tool do they use once they got that small machine on to the moon ","i i looked at again "
21426,130.1,Chris,,"yeah exactly okay so what i'm hearing from you class now is we have two different tools that are really important in this ","well the microscope part that's part three "
21429,230.2,Luis,,"part three okay cool and what about our orbiter where do we see evidence that that was an important tool for our scientists ","oh okay i got it i read that passage and it talks about that orbiter thing oh it sounds amazing and it's in part two "
21432,230.2,Chris,,,"well to to change my answer so i first i didn't we didn't really talk about equipment in my answer but now i'm thinking i need to put equipment and on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they have to use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits so i would add those equipment pieces to my answer "
21435,420.2,Chris,,"but i'm wondering if we could make sure we circle back right to that passage what information in the passage might help you build a stronger answer to the equipment scientists needed for this specific mission ","sure the equipment has to be from the story "
21437,420.2,Chris,,,"okay well then i guess i guess i picked a microscope i think "
21445,210.3,Oliver,,"does class else have a reflection on how they would go back and try to edit their answers or revise i should say yeah student ","yeah yeah okay from from what we talked about it sounds like there's kind of two right answers like you could say um so they sent the lunar orbiter and then the lunar orbiter used a microscope Okay um well, I would say to discover water on the moon scientist used a lunar orbiter with a microscope. Oh Okay, well, I think what's different is I added I added the other piece, so that it had it had all the pieces, instead of just one piece. oh i'm so sorry i really want to keep going because this class is really fun but i looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now "
21448,210.3,Oliver,,,"yeah we're getting hungry so but before we go i just i really wanted to say thank you so much for coming and for listening to all of our responses and helping us understand what were the pieces from the story that we could pull out and and how they fit together on that was really helpful to remember we had to find them in the story "
21451,210.3,Luis,,,"um i'm good ms teacher but um excuse me i shouldn't be here i already know all about space "
21455,210.4,Chris,,"when you class read this article what did you class think was the most interesting parts of it ","i thought about how they're looking for water on the moon is pretty cool "
21460,130.2,Farrah,,"yeahm did class else find something else that they thought was interesting ","well i guess that they're that they i don't know i guess i wasn't really thinking about interesting or just kind of answering the question "
21465,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what about you did anything stick out as interesting to you ","um well i guess i do think it's interesting that they're looking for water on the moon cause i don't know if they expect that we're going to have to like live on the moon you know because if we destroy our earth then we can't live here i don't know "
21469,140.1,Jazmin,,"would any of you class be excited to live on the moon if you could ","i mean i'd like to live on the moon but i don't think that we can and i would rather that we take care of the earth that we have "
21472,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah that's pretty important ","um yeah i mean that'd be pretty cool you know and then i could just kind of look down at earth and i can be like hey class down there i'm just chilling up here even though they probably couldn't hear me but it's a pretty cool thing to do "
21479,210.2,Farrah,,"does someone think they could start us off by rephrasing that question in their own words ","okay um what did the scientists what did the scientists use to find water on the moon oh yeah okay that's mine "
21484,120.4,Jazmin,,"well student what were you thinking ","um i guess i was let me try something different what did this scientists from nasa use to define water on the moon i guess that similar to um farrah's you know i feel like i answered this question so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
21487,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay well let's dive in a little bit thank you thank you class both for repeating the question it's okay that it sounds similar ","i said nasa sent a small machine "
21493,430.2,Jazmin,,"but i'm worried that that's not the whole story could you look back to the text to the text and try to find some more evidence that supports that ","More evidence? i mean i could say the rest of the sentence nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate is that enough "
21498,120.4,Oliver,,"student do you have an idea ","okay yeah i was saying i was thinking well it says it'll land at the south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater so i mean on one hand that means that it's looking for it but then my answer was about the microscope cause then it says you know at the end you know the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you're looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that was my answer "
21504,120.4,Chris,,"student what was your thinking for this question ","i was i actually found my information in the first paragraph because that's where they were talking more about the water on the moon "
21506,120.4,Chris,,"okay so what else what did what did you say for how the scientists found the water ","oh i said that they found craters full of water on the moon "
21510,410.2,Chris,,"yeah i'm worried that the response doesn't actually answer the question ","um what equipment that scientists used to discover oh what equipment i forgot the equipment part "
21514,150.1,Luis,,"student have i heard from you ","nah but i'm ok "
21516,120.4,Chris,,"ok well student let's talk about your response we'll jump over to student and then we'll all get a second to revise our responses so student what did you share for the equipment scientists use ","um i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks you know i went to nasa so i know scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21518,230.1,Luis,,"okay so that was evidence you got from your own experience ","yeah "
21522,120.4,Oliver,,"student what are you thinking ","yeah sorry to interrupt you teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so well i'll see you later okay "
21526,120.4,Luis,,,"excuse me ah i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
21528,150.1,Luis,,"student can i pause you for one second we're going to hear what farrahs was thinking and then we're all going to get a chance to revise before we continue okay ","okay "
21532,120.4,Farrah,,"alright student what were you thinking ","um yeah so um oh man teacher i don't remember what we were saying before we went on our break "
21536,120.2,Farrah,,"scientists used to discover water on the moon ","yeah yeah so i i thought it was a microscope because i read this part where it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21541,420.3,Farrah,,"i would suggest you go back to the text and try to find a little bit more detail about how the scientists were using the microscope to make this discovery ","okay i know you had told student that he didn't have the whole story so i went back because we have the same answer but i don't see i feel like it answers all the parts to the questions the who and the what and the why i mean i guess i could add about to look really closely at the water do you want me to like do i have to say water in the answer "
21546,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class else think they could answer farrah's question ","well i know i didn't have equipment in my answer so i had to add that um but for farrah's answer i guess she is saying the equipments and she's got her action word that they're looking really closely um maybe it is water part she she has to add a detail about the water itself maybe i'm still confused "
21550,210.4,Jazmin,,"did the did the nasa astronauts just send the microscope up to the moon on its own ","no cuz that's why i have my answer the small machine because that's they sent that first i think "
21552,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah so student why was the small machine so important in this example ","because that's what they use to investigate that's what they use to look for the ice deposits right "
21555,210.3,Oliver,,"so student you also wrote your response about the microscope so looking back at the text are there any other details that you might want to include now ","well i since you were telling student the thing that she said was was the right one then i think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to um the lunar orbiter "
21560,230.3,Oliver,,"so you think you should shift totally from the microscope to the lunar orbiter to clarify ","okay let me see um well because i thought it was a microscope but then student just said that they use a lunar orbiter to look for the ice deposit so i think it's the lunar orbiter not the microscope maybe "
21570,420.2,Oliver,,"so let's go back through reread and really try to find an idea that's connected to the text. ","okay okay so in the first paragraph that's what student had said but there is no equipment in that one um so in the second paragraph nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate okay um the lunar orbiter will land on the moon's south pole and look for ice deposits in a large polar crater well then that's why i think that's the right answer cuz cuz it's looking for the ice deposit and that's what the question is asking us what what equipment are used to look for the water "
21572,210.3,Oliver,,"okay so if you got to when you revise your response what do you think you'll change ","um okay so i was saying that it was the microscope that they're looking at the water closely at but now i think it's the lunar orbiter that they're looking for the ice with "
21578,130.2,Chris,,"does that shift class else's thinking about their response to here student explaining where he found that in the text ","okay um i think i didn't even think about that second paragraph because of i was looking for water but now i guess now well because both student and student have the lunar orbiter and it does say it's looking for ice deposits so i think that's it too i think that's the right one and you know what teacher um i read that there might be a base on the moon by 2024 um so maybe maybe they the do need to find the water so that they can like start drilling for water or something "
21584,520.1,Chris,,"so what do you think you would do next time you get a question like this ","me okay well i guess i'd make sure that i i have all of the parts to the question in my answer because i forgot about the first part yeah so i think that's what i do is have all the parts of the question in my answer "
21590,120.4,Luis,,"let's take a minute right now and try to revise our answers and then student let's start with you for sharing out a revised answer to this question ","okay um okay so i think i'll say that scientists use a lot of equipment to discover water on the moon like the lunar orbiter yeah i like okay that's my answer "
21594,530.1,Luis,,"okay so what was different about that answer versus your first response ","well i i i use the name of the equipment from the story because instead of my background knowledge and i added the part about discovering water because that was in the question like student said "
21598,130.2,Jazmin,,"student is there anything else you would want to add to luis's response to make sure that it fully answers the question ","um well i kept the part i put about nasa cuz that's in the story too so he said scientists and i said nasa so i said nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
21603,520.1,Jazmin,,"what do you think will stick with you for the next time you're answering a similar question ","hmm what would stick with me is that i have to say the name of the thing and to put more of the details from the story in my answer or from the question in my answer "
21606,530.1,Oliver,,"student what about you how did your answer change when you were able to revise it ","i'm so sorry to interrupt you again teacher but it's time for us to go to lunch "
21610,530.1,Oliver,,,"but i wanted to say you know thanks for for asking us some really good questions cuz i i hadn't really thought about like why would i change my answer and how would i change my answer i was just trying to make it more of a right answer based on what what student and student said and then you were like okay student but i want to hear from all of the story and not just from about the people and so then i had to kind of like go back to the story you know and try to figure out um yeah oh why so "
21614,530.1,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
21616,530.1,Farrah,,,"great we're really excited to work with you today "
21619,230.3,Luis,,"student you started with you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely correct ","oh excuse me excuse me "
21621,230.3,Luis,,,"i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21624,230.3,Farrah,,"student so you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that was your answer correct ","yes that's what i said "
21626,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so in our article that we had talking about water on the moon i agree that you would need a microscope if you were to look at the stuff those scientists found what kind of tool are they using to find that water that we would use a microscope to look at ","well i i guess i thought the microscope was that tool because um how how can you find something if you can't even see it "
21630,210.4,Farrah,,"i agree that is very difficult but if we were to find that water right we're looking at the water and we're using a microscope how do we get the water ","okay well um paragraph two it says there's a small machine and it goes to the craters "
21632,210.4,Farrah,,"very good what's this small machine called ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
21634,120.2,Farrah,,"excellent so i'm going to ask the question one more time what equipment did scientists use to discover water and the moon ","okay "
21636,120.3,Farrah,,"paragraph two ","they i guess they use the lunar orbiter to discover it "
21638,150.1,Oliver,,"excellent they use the lunar orbiter to discover it student you said the same exact thing as student does that make a little more sense to you ","oh i think so um but i guess um i don't know how i would have picked that i think i think i still i still would have picked the microscope um until you told me to look at paragraph two "
21641,230.1,Oliver,,"okay so we're still thinking about that microscope right what makes you think that they want to use a microscope ","oh well yeah we we know what a microscope is we use it in science class "
21647,210.4,Oliver,,"so we're talking let's look at that microscope right so we're using the microscope to look at the water when our question's asking us how we discover water on the moon when the microscope is used to dis ","i mean i guess i get it now i get that i got that the lunar orbiter is is how you'll find the water but i guess what i'm saying is i don't know if i would have been able to find that on my own "
21650,120.3,Chris,,"student you mentioned that scientists found craters full of water on the moon can you take a look at the the title for me can you read the title of the article for me ","yeah ok it says okay water on the moon is a desert "
21652,210.4,Chris,,"right can you tell me what a desert is ","oh well um a desert it's really dry "
21654,210.4,Chris,,"right right a desert is really dry so if we're saying the moon is a desert what are we saying there's not a lot of there ","well water i guess "
21657,210.2,Jazmin,,"right so maybe there's not a lot of water and now let's go back to that question so we're asking what scientists use to discover that little itty bit of water that we can find what tool do you think they are using to find that teeny bit of water ","yeah so my answer was the small the small the small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21661,110.1,Chris,,"student let's give student one more second okay so student double check that ","well i guess it's that lunar orbiter "
21666,420.2,Jazmin,,"very good alright student um your answer was almost there and you've got just half of it i want you to be a little more specific so you told me that nasa sent a small machine which is absolutely true can you tell me what that small machine was called ","well we said it already it's the lunar orbiter That was it? "
21669,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that makes sense student ","so i just have to say the name "
21671,130.3,Jazmin,,"nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter that way i know all i need to know ","oh wow ok "
21673,130.3,Chris,,,"oh well okay i thought of some more some more information "
21676,130.3,Chris,,,"and because i am i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21678,230.3,Luis,,"right they do and that's exactly what student told me right so student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right ","they sure do "
21681,210.3,Luis,,"so if a scientist is looking for just a little bit of water on the moon like all the rest of our friends here said think about what kind of equipment that kind of scientists would use to look for water on the moon ","okay i think i get what you're saying like um all astronauts need oxygen tanks but um certain astronauts need something different to find the water "
21683,210.1,Oliver,,"possibly you need different tools for different tasks right student ","um yeah i'm so sorry but i just looked at the clock out we have to go to lunch right now "
21686,210.1,Oliver,,,"before before we go i wanted to say thank you because you really helped us understand the question and how we needed the tool for discovering the water and that really helped me see why my answer wasn't quite the right answer and so thank you so much for helping us understand that "
21690,210.2,Luis,,"hey class so you gave really great responses to this question i want us to backtrack and think about what exactly is equipment ","well actually i wanted to say i shouldn't be in this room already know all about space "
21692,110.3,Luis,,"that's awesome student that you have previous experience you know it's really important that in our class we work together so maybe you can help out your classmates to understand this text a little bit better ","oh yeah i can definitely help out "
21694,210.2,Luis,,"so student do you want to try answering that question for us what does equipment mean ","um yeah okay so as it's like a tool and it's something you use to do something "
21699,130.2,Farrah,,"does class else want to add on to what the word equipment means ","um so sometimes equipment could be something old but sometimes it could be maybe something you wear on your body "
21704,210.4,Oliver,,"so in this text we learned that the scientists needed to use equipment on the moon why do you class think they needed to use equipment why couldn't the scientists just look with their eyes or touch with their hands go ahead student ","so actually in the text it says the water because we know that are looking for water is really really really really really small so they can't just look at it they need equipment to help them find it "
21708,210.4,Farrah,,"that's a great idea what type of equipment do you think they would need to look at water ","um so me and student um we had the same answer and it was the microscope um yeah we agreed it's the microscope on because you can't look at it at the water without the microscope so i don't understand why is our answer wrong "
21712,210.3,Farrah,,"i want to push you a little bit to think about what the scientists be able to use the microscopes on the moon ","oh well i mean i guess i thought they did on yeah i thought so but maybe maybe not since you're asking about it "
21714,210.4,Farrah,,"have you ever used a microscope student ","oh yeah yeah we use them in science class "
21717,130.2,Chris,,"um student you have your hand raised earlier do you want to maybe add on to what student and student have shared so far ","oh yeah well so i'm in terms of equipment actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21719,230.1,Chris,,"yeah and why did why did nasa astronauts need all those things ","uh well those things they all they help them stay alive when they go out into space and they keep them safe "
21722,230.1,Chris,,"yeah could you tell me a little bit more about those suits what do they look like ","oh they they kind of look like sleeping bags with arms they're all white they're kind of poofy um they've got a big kind of backpack looking thing on the back and then they've got the helmet with the with the circle of glass that you can see through "
21726,210.3,Farrah,,"so an astronaut or a scientist if they were to use a microscope on the moon like student said they would need to wear one of those big suits to keep them safe do you think it might be a little challenging to use a microscope with a big suit or do you think they'd be totally okay ","it seems like that'd be pretty hard "
21732,130.2,Jazmin,,"student is it okay if student helps you out this question ","okay so i said and i found this in the story that nasa they sent a small machine to help them find the water "
21734,230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah that's what can you tell us which paragraph you saw that in see they're numbered 1 2 3 ","i found it in paragraph number two "
21737,210.4,Farrah,,"so coming back to you student so student helped you out you pointed out this small machine do you think that's something that scientists would be able to use to help with the big suit problem ","yeah yeah it sounds like the microscope it'd be kind of hard maybe to hold um and look through with the with the circle last thing that student was talking about so it sounds like they might need another tool instead "
21740,130.2,Oliver,,"student you started out the same answer as student do you agree with what you said you want to add on ","oh yeah i agree but i'm also um i don't really know how i would have figured that out if student hadn't told us about the suits and things how would i have figured that out just on my own "
21745,130.2,Luis,,"can do you think you could answer oliver's question how would he know that scientists would face some of these problems with the big suits and having to survive on the moon ","um well i mean it helps to know a lot about space like me and i guess student he kind of knows a lot about space too but i would say when you read about space just try to like picture it in your head and really see it um come to life and then you can imagine the astronauts calling them microscopes um or using the machine or orbiting the moon or all of that stuff just picture it in your head student come on "
21748,110.3,Oliver,,"thanks student i know you already know a lot about space but not class has necessarily had that experience um can you tell us ","um well actually i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now all but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to all of our answers and taking the time to help us understand the meaning behind the text and the microscope that was so helpful thank you so much "
21751,230.2,Farrah,,"hi class i'm i'm so glad that class had shared their answer and i want to call on student could you explain more about what in the text me do you find your answer ","yeah okay well i'm so on the third paragraph at the bottom it says that the water is microscopic so you need a microscope to look really closely "
21754,130.2,Luis,,"so what does class else think do you class agree that the microscope is the technology and the equipment that is needed in order to discover water on the moon or do you disagree and might think it's something else ","yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21756,150.1,Luis,,"well that i mean we all have parts of knowledge that we love and are passionate about but i just want to make 100 i just want to be 100 clear that we all have gotten it and understood it ","oh yeah oh ok that's fine "
21761,130.2,Oliver,,"the scientists need a microscope in order to look really closely at at the finding water on the moon is that something that you agree with or disagree with based on the text and when you answer i want you to be able to find exactly where in the text he found your answer ","yeah so actually i circled the same as student about the microscopes and she she showed us the part in part three where it talks about arm a water being microscopic um and let's see what else does it say um yeah so you wouldn't be able to see it as if you were looking straight at it "
21763,120.3,Oliver,,"yes so you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it can you read the next sentence out loud for us please ","okay um so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21766,210.4,Oliver,,"why would you need a microscope according to that sentence what are you going to do with the microscope in that one sentence ","i'm gonna look at really really small bits of water "
21769,210.3,Jazmin,,"so yes you're 100 correct so if you need to look at those really small bits of water does that help you discover all of the water on the moon or just bits and pieces of that water ","oh yeah thank you so i i kind of disagree about this microscope part and in my answer it was that necessity to small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21771,130.2,Chris,,"okay well i'm going to toss it back to the class is her answer wrong and if it is explained why with evidence from the text ","okay can i try "
21773,130.2,Chris,,,"okay well so there's the microscope and there's the lunar orbiter thing and let me see okay well i'm here in the text it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate on and oh i don't know they both sound like really good answers "
21776,210.4,Chris,,"okay so keep going so you were reading paragraph two and what do you think the purpose of that small machine the lunar orbiter is for ","what it says okay this is from the text it says investigate "
21778,210.4,Luis,,"yes and then what else does the lunar orbiter do ","oh i know um can i go can i go "
21780,110.1,Luis,,"could you let it student finish his sentence and then you could go next ","okay okay "
21782,120.4,Chris,,"of course thank you student i appreciate that and thank you for being so patient and student where you done speaking or did you want to add more about what the lunar orbiter does ","well i wanted to add on it's really about the lunar orbiter but it's that on i went to nasa actually so i know that the scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21786,120.4,Luis,,"student could you share your answer now thank you so much for waiting so patiently ","oh yeah well i was just gonna say that about the lunar orbiter so what it does is it looks for where the ice a little a little small it looks for where it is on the moon yeah because you asked what it did "
21788,230.2,Luis,,"yes and can you tell us exactly where you found that in the text which paragraph and sentence in that paragraph ","yep yep yep okay um paragraph two and the second sentence "
21793,210.4,Oliver,,"and what it's investigating is what student shared with us from paragraph to sentence to that it's looking for ice deposits in a large polar crater if it's looking for ice deposit what do you think it's looking for what are ice deposits ","well ice and is the same as water that's like frozen water "
21795,210.4,Oliver,,"so what can the lunar orbiter help us find ","oh so that helps you find the water or really small water "
21798,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah ","yeah um i just looked at the clock actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and find the words and the parts of the of the story that we're going to help us find our answer that was so helpful "
21803,120.2,Luis,,"so i know that first up we have the first question we answered in our journal which was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um excuse me i should have been desperate i already know all about space "
21812,130.2,Chris,,"and share their answer first with what they think the answer to number one is then share their evidence and prove why they're right ","on okay i'm i'm closest to the window and i said microscope and i think it's because in part three it says the water is microscopic so that means you can't see it without a microscope okay um my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon on and i found my evidence in part one um it says that scientists found evidence of water in the moon's polar craters "
21817,120.2,Jazmin,,"so first i see a student could you share what your answer was please am the evidence ","okay my answer is nasa center small machine and the evidence is the first sentence and paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21819,230.1,Jazmin,,"so um what makes you think that your answers wrong ","um well since i'm in this class "
21824,150.1,Jazmin,,"that you're necessarily wrong we're just going and pushing our thinking to think more deeply about what we're reading about does that make sense ","makes me feel better "
21826,120.2,Jazmin,,"awesome so with some confidence of what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence ","okay i got nasa sent a small machine and i found my evidence at the beginning of paragraph two "
21833,120.2,Chris,,"alright student your it's your turn what did you get for number one and where did you find your evidence and proof ","oh well so this isn't what i said for number one but now i realized number one is talking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21836,120.2,Chris,,"could you tell us specifically what piece of equipment did they use in this reading in order to find that water on the moon ","mm hmm okay so well first i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon and that's still true but when i talked to student and student they both were talking about equipment on so since you said student had the right answer i think it's a lunar orbiter "
21840,130.2,Chris,,"or would you go with your first answer ","um well i'm not sure i think my first answer is right but um i know it doesn't say equipment but i don't really know what the equipment is i just listened to student "
21843,310.1,Oliver,,"i love how you both had different opinions and said your evidence and went there yes student ","on i'm sorry but it's time for us to go "
21847,310.1,Oliver,,,"all right see on "
21851,150.1,Chris,,"hi it's nice to see you all again and i am excited for us to dig deeper and understanding about water on the moon ","mm hmm so my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon but when i talked to student and student they were both talking about equipment so on i'm not really sure what the right equipment is "
21853,130.2,Luis,,"so student is a little confused about what actually is the right equipment does class have a suggestion for what student to do next student ","um yeah well i just wanted to say um i think i got this all figured out so i'm good "
21855,130.2,Luis,,"so can you help us move our thinking forward what is something student to do to confirm his thinking ","okay i'm student you need equipment and your answer so i said oxygen tanks because that is definitely equipment that scientists use on the moon "
21857,230.2,Luis,,"could you tell me where you found that in the text ","um okay well i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water i definitely have oxygen tanks "
21868,130.2,Farrah,,"and the same person who was by the window closest to the window sorry is going to speak first and i want you to share with your partner the exact piece of evidence that you circled in the text this time around and if it changed tell your partner why all right go ","okay um my answer didn't change it's still microscope and i circled the word microscope because it is in the third paragraph i'm okay i um i circled small machine because like student said small machine it's a piece of equipment "
21871,120.4,Farrah,,"student ","okay yeah i circled you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21873,230.1,Farrah,,"tell me more why does that make you think that that is what helps find water on the moon ","well actually i'm i'm still kind of confused "
21875,150.1,Oliver,,"is class else confused um i don't know if you class can do and i agree sign but we that's that's what i do in real life so i'm student ","on yeah i'm confused too because while we both said microscope and there's evidence and the text but there's also the machine and i don't know what the right answer is "
21882,210.4,Oliver,,"and that helped give us something called context um after looking at that context do is sorry excuse me does the microscope actually help get water out of the moon ","and well it sounds like that helps someone look for the water and look out for water because you can't see it without the microscope "
21885,120.3,Chris,,"yeah that is that is 100 correct but can i have somebody read question one out loud for us again ","yeah okay the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and well i read that there could be a base on the moon by 24 "
21892,210.4,Oliver,,"is that actually telling me how they got they were able to see the water or describing how small the water is ","that explanation makes sense but they're just describing the water um but i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go on but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much because you really explained what each one of us need to work on and give us a really good ideas for how to think about the text and the question and a new way thank you so much "
21895,230.2,Luis,,"student could you point out in the text where you saw that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ","oh well actually well i was just gonna say i i shouldn't even be in this class because i already know all about space "
21900,120.2,Luis,,"for answering the question on what equipment scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um well um okay well um i guess it's um i didn't circle anything in the reading um but i just know that after scientists are astronauts on the moon i know they need oxygen tanks 100 "
21902,210.3,Luis,,"okay and that's correct do you think the oxygen tanks help them discover water on the moon ","wow they need the tanks to stay alive while they discover water on the moon "
21905,210.3,Luis,,"correct yeah that's great and then do you think that there's other equipment that they probably used in order to discover the actual water ","yeah probably "
21911,130.2,Farrah,,"or actually student um do you agree with student that ","well okay i think student has a good point about how the astronauts probably used to the oxygen tanks but i think for discovering the water i found a different tool which is on the microscope and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21913,230.2,Farrah,,"no no one said your answers necessarily wrong but could you point out in the text where you saw that the scientific tool that was used for the water was the microscope ","yeah so it's in part three "
21915,120.3,Farrah,,"and specifically what is the sentence say ","yeah it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
21919,210.4,Farrah,,"is there a difference between you would need and ","well i guess i just kind of thought when they said you would need that it meant the scientists would need a microscope "
21923,210.4,Farrah,,"so do you think this piece was written for the scientists or for us to read ","oh well i think for us right the scientists don't need this "
21927,210.4,Farrah,,"that would be referring to us we would need a microscope ","oh whoa okay i i didn't even think of that that's so interesting so the scientists they didn't need a microscope "
21936,230.1,Jazmin,,"could you describe more this machine that they use ","and okay so nasa such a small machine and and let me say and it says them a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
21938,210.4,Jazmin,,"and what is the lunar orbiter look for ","i think oh i said i know this okay it says it looks for ice deposits "
21941,210.4,Jazmin,,"and what is ice ","yeah because i was just frozen water "
21946,210.4,Farrah,,"the scientists used to discover water on the moon ","yeah cuz i think with what you said with the part student read it says nasa nasa scientists war machine "
21948,110.1,Chris,,"right so perfect student ","yeah well actually student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like will like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
21951,230.2,Chris,,"now does this specific piece of writing does a specific article mention any of the other equipment that we that was used ","know the story the story just says the small machine and the microscope "
21954,210.4,Chris,,"did they use the microscope for discovering the water or is the water so small that if a person had to see it maybe they would have to use a microscope ","right right right yeah yeah i heard you talking about that was so valuable for yeah thank you for reminding me "
21958,210.4,Oliver,,,"i'm i'm so sorry um i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read the text really closely and understand the really small differences between between the the microscope and the lunar orbiter that was so helpful "
21962,230.1,Luis,,"student can you explain to me how you came to your answer ","yeah well actually i was just gonna say that i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
21965,230.2,Luis,,"well that's wonderful ","um well i just i just know that if there's astronauts on the moon looking for this water they are definitely using oxygen tanks "
21969,430.2,Luis,,"which maybe your classmates might not have so if we could redirect yourself to the text i suggest rereading it and picking out the exact line where it says what equipment scientists or nasa us to discover water ","okay um i guess i should read it yeah okay "
21972,230.2,Jazmin,,"student what in the text drove you to your answer ","ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i found that at the beginning of like paragraph 2 "
21976,430.2,Jazmin,,"to the second part of this sentence and to identify what specifically was the small machine that they used ","okay it says it's called a lunar orbiter "
21979,110.1,Farrah,,"yes exactly ","can i go next because i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
21981,230.2,Farrah,,"right so student where in the text did you find the microscope ","on part three "
21983,110.4,Farrah,,"part three okay ","ya there's a sentence it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely that's where i found it "
21987,430.3,Farrah,,"but what my concern is is that the text doesn't necessarily say the scientists at nasa used a microscope right and so what i suggest you to do is go back and reread it to see what nasa and the scientists specifically used in order to investigate and find water ","okay i can try that "
21989,230.1,Chris,,"and student do you want to in the meantime while student and student reread the text do you want to talk about how you came up with scientists finding creators of water on the moon ","yeah yeah so um there's this part okay it's near the beginning paragraph one it says um well let me find it okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
21992,310.1,Chris,,"that's a great sentence to point out because that's the whole point of our question right ","yeah exactly it's all about the water "
21995,430.1,Chris,,"what was the equipment that they use to find the water so this answers the question the fact where they found the water not what they use to find the water so i just suggest kind of going back into the text and looking at what equipment was used to find the water ","yeah well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
21999,430.2,Chris,,"because some other classmates might not have that context right and so this exercise is specifically what this article says the scientists use ","so it has to be in the story "
22001,420.2,Chris,,"yeah my suggestion is that we just use evidence from this story ","oh okay yeah i understand "
22003,230.2,Luis,,"student have you found were in the story you want us to focus on ","okay so um i found these two there's two pieces of equipment that they name in the story and one is lunar orbiter and the other as mike ruskell um so i guess i'd probably say those two things "
22007,210.4,Luis,,"now ice what is ice i guess ","oh um water "
22010,230.3,Oliver,,"yes perfect so ice is water now in the microscope part this is kind of what student and student were pointing out ","um well i just i realized it's time for us to go now but thank you for taking the time to work with us "
22014,230.3,Luis,,,"um yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm good "
22016,230.1,Luis,,"perfect so what have you figured out ","um the answer is the lunar orbiter "
22019,210.3,Luis,,"would you be able to describe why it's not a microscope ","um no i don't know i just figured it was lunar orbiter from listening to the conversation "
22023,130.2,Jazmin,,"ok can someone else explain why the microscope was not an equipment that the scientists and nasa use ","and okay i can try so the lunar orbiter it says in the story they use it to investigate but the microscope it just says you need a scientific tool called a microscope so i don't think that means that the astronauts actually used one on the moon "
22026,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense to class ","um i have a question yes so my question is if there's no microscope on the moon how how can you discover something if you can't see it if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope "
22031,210.1,Farrah,,"but they can identify it without a microscope the machine can but we cannot as humans ","um i'm still kind of confused "
22033,230.1,Farrah,,"so what is confusing to you about that ","so there's no people it's just the machine "
22036,210.4,Farrah,,"these craters that they talk about these polar craters and it does analyses right in order to see it kind of samples the ground to see if there's any molecules but the machine itself doesn't need a microscope ","that's really cool i i wish the story said that "
22039,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah well um i guess it's implied here that the lunar orbiter has some sort of technology that is able to investigate and identify water through the ice deposits ","that's so cool um yeah so i i understand that now that makes a lot of sense what you said about the lunar orbiter how we can just do it without a microscope so they don't really need a separate microscope but um i don't know how i would have figured that out on my own "
22042,210.1,Oliver,,"so um going back to the text and the question so the question says what equipment did the scientists use to discover water on the moon right now who are the scientists working with ","um nasa "
22045,210.1,Oliver,,"yeah perfect that's great so the scientists are working with nasa ","haha ok ok that's like the part student read that says scientists sent a small machine "
22047,110.1,Oliver,,"right exactly ","oh so is class using a microscope "
22051,210.4,Oliver,,"so we would need a microscope ","that's really cool and i would love to go to the moon and look at the water and a microscope and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22055,110.1,Luis,,"that's very cool that's very interesting ","um ok so my thinking changed because well my first answer um didn't come from the story and i guess i hadn't read it very closely and then when i read it um closer i found equipment that was actually in the story "
22060,110.1,Chris,,"great ","on my thinking it changed because first i didn't know it had to be about equipment but then when you pointed out for me to look again i realized i had to talk about equipment "
22065,110.1,Farrah,,"great ","on okay my thinking changed because i thought it was the microscope but then when you explained how it works and when you said i had to look for what the scientists used that's how we can know lunar orbiter is the right answer and i i looked at the clock just now and we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping each one of us understand what we could do to help make our answer even better "
22067,110.1,Farrah,,,"hello hello how are you today "
22069,110.1,Farrah,,,"we're great we're so excited for your class "
22071,110.1,Farrah,,,"oh we all read it we all just read it "
22073,150.1,Luis,,"oh that's great and what did you think of it oh yes student ","yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space "
22077,150.1,Chris,,"okay so who can tell me what the article is about ","i can i can i "
22079,150.1,Chris,,,"so the article is about how nasa and the scientists they used to think the moon was a desert it was totally dry but now they know that there's water on the moon and they found it in these craters full of water "
22083,150.1,Farrah,,"what else do you remember from the article ","oh right remember yeah that the water it's it's ice it's frozen water and it's really really small pieces so small you need a microscope "
22085,210.4,Farrah,,"oh and what is a microscope ","it it's a tool a piece of equipment and that's why i picked it for my answer because it said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22088,210.4,Oliver,,"what are some other things you could think of that you might use a microscope for ","up well you could use it to look at like bacterial and cells and other tiny teeny things "
22091,210.4,Oliver,,"has class seen a microscope before ","oh yeah we use them in science class in the lab "
22093,210.4,Oliver,,"and what do you use them for in science class ","obviously one time we took a dirt sample outside and then we analyzed it and we looked at under the microscope and we could see so much more than we couldn't we just looked at it with our eyes "
22095,140.1,Oliver,,"oh what kind of stuff did you see ","oh all sorts of things lots of teeny tiny little brains and everything was so much smaller than i thought it was "
22099,210.4,Farrah,,"wow that's awesome and what kind of things do you think you'd see if you looked at some dirt from the moon or the water the frozen water ","well i think yeah i'm i'm not really sure what you'd see but i'm a little confused because we're talking so much about the microscope but i thought we were here because our answers are wrong and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22108,210.4,Jazmin,,"what can you tell me about the machine that nasa sent to the moon the lunar orbiter ","yes this was my answer i said nasa sent a small machine they used to look for the ice deposits in the craters "
22110,210.4,Jazmin,,"oh great and can you tell me more about the ice craters because you have to like i don't know anything about the ice crater so i need you to explain it to me oh ","okay let me look at the reading okay well it says that they're really deep and they're really dark "
22114,210.4,Chris,,"but are they like the grand canyon like deep holes in the ground what do you think they look like ","well isn't a crater like a hole but above ground kind of "
22116,210.4,Chris,,"yeah so it's a it is a hole off the ground it's kind of elevated ","yeah cuz i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and and when i was there i saw i saw all sorts of equipment that scientists to use like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22119,140.1,Chris,,"since you went there and did it make you want to join nasa and go to the moon ","yeah oh it was so cool i would love to put on that space suit and grab my microscope and look at the little pieces of water on the moon "
22122,110.3,Chris,,"because the fact that you were able to include your own experience in there is really awesome ","oh yeah i could definitely add that to my answer "
22127,110.3,Jazmin,,,"okay you said about how the moon is so dry it's even drier than earth i think that's really interesting because here on earth we we need to really focus on saving our planet and our oceans and the water and to think that the moon is even dryer it just it's just really makes me wonder like will there ever be a life there one day "
22129,230.1,Jazmin,,"oh yeah that's interesting how do you think you could work that into your answer ","let's see i could say nasa sent a small machine and it found water but it's really really small frozen water nothing like the oceans on earth "
22132,140.1,Oliver,,"right and how do you think you could you were just talking about life on the moon and maybe how we need to do more on earth to protect our planet do you think you could work that into your answer ","on i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for listening to all of our personal experiences and opinions and helping us find ways to connect them to the story that made it really interesting to to write and think about our answers so thank you so much "
22134,140.1,Jazmin,,,"hi teacher "
22136,140.1,Luis,,,"i'm good but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22138,140.1,Luis,,"oh what do you know about space ","okay i know that astronauts use space suits so that they don't like freeze to death in space and i know that there's no gravity up there so if they're walking around they have to wear like gravity boots so that they can walk on the moon and a bunch of other stuff too "
22140,110.3,Luis,,"okay well it sounds like you know a lot about space but you can stick around in this class just to help class else learn what you know ","oh okay okay well i'll be your teacher today class "
22142,150.1,Farrah,,"okay does class else have any questions before we get started ","i don't "
22145,150.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah we have them on our tablets "
22149,120.4,Chris,,"okay so who would like to share their response first ","i can go first okay i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
22155,210.4,Chris,,"what else did you learn about the moon from the article ","oh let's see um that they need a microscope to look at the water um that it can only fill like a couple of cups or something like that "
22157,210.4,Chris,,"and what is a microscope ","is a tool that we use in science class to look at like teeny tiny things "
22162,210.4,Jazmin,,"and why do you think the people would be looking for water on the moon ","oh yeah because we're definitely destroying this planet but i don't think we can live on the moon maybe cause you know we're gonna have to live on the moon maybe in the future or something if we if we destroy this planet because of the atmosphere but they're trying to see if we can live on mars "
22165,140.1,Jazmin,,"student could you tell me a little bit about the atmosphere ","um okay i don't know exactly but i think that the moon doesn't have like an atmosphere that you know like that we could that protects us or anything you know like how we have the ozone layer here that protects us from the sun well we did until like people are totally destroying it um but that's another story for another day "
22170,110.1,Jazmin,,"sounds pretty dark ","yeah yeah i really am i'm an environmentalist and so i think that everybody's just kind of destroying our planet "
22174,210.4,Jazmin,,"so how do you think you could tie that into what you read in the article ","i guess that we're looking for water on the moon um so that we can well i don't know why but i feel like i don't understand why my answers wrong "
22176,120.4,Jazmin,,"what was your answer ","that nasa sent a small machine "
22178,210.4,Jazmin,,"so nasa sent a small machine why did they send the machine ","to look for the water on the moon "
22182,420.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so maybe just add that to response and then do you think you could also talk about what you were just telling me about being an environmentalist and ","so i just have to add in to look for water on the moon and then i can add some sentences about about being an environmentalist okay "
22185,120.4,Farrah,,"all right and student how about you what was your answer ","oh yeah i didn't know what my answer was wrong either i said that scientists uh no you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22189,210.4,Farrah,,"and how it relates to finding water ","oh okay they use the microscope to look at the water really closely um and how it relates to finding the water um "
22193,210.4,Farrah,,"like why were they using a microscope to look at the water what were they were hoping to find ","okay it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at so they needed the scientific tool called the microscope because the water was microscopic Oh yeah that's all I gotta do is just add more sentences? yeah I can I can write down that second part of the sentence in there. "
22197,120.4,Chris,,"and student how about you what was your answer ","oh excuse me teacher i was just thinking about the equipment because um student said the microscope and then student said the small machine and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like all oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22199,120.4,Chris,,"so what was your answer the question ","um that they found craters for water on the moon "
22202,420.2,Chris,,"yeah so how do you think you could describe some of the equipment they use to get to the moon ","oh yeah yeah i think i forgot to put i forgot to put that part in there about the equipment "
22205,420.2,Chris,,"i think you could also talk about your own experience going to nasa ","i can put that in my answer too "
22207,420.2,Chris,,,"oh i didn't know that because our last teacher told me that i was writing too much background knowledge because it wasn't connected to the the question in the text "
22211,150.1,Chris,,"you think you could do that ","yeah yeah yeah that's sounds exciting oh yeah i'll add that right now "
22213,150.1,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go so we'll have to see you next time okay "
22215,150.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
22217,150.1,Luis,,,"hi uh teacher i think i figured it all out now so i'm all good "
22219,120.4,Luis,,"okay what did you figure out ","okay i heard you telling student and student and student that they can add some of their background knowledge into their answer so i'm just going to do that and so i think i can go back to my desk "
22221,230.1,Luis,,"what background knowledge do you want to add to your answer did you read your answer ","yeah well i said that scientists use oxygen tanks "
22224,210.4,Luis,,"because it's about trying to find water on the moon ","yeah well i mean they use oxygen tanks to breathe and so they can't look for water on the moon if they can't breathe up there "
22228,230.3,Luis,,"yeah that's true very good point so um you've established that they need these oxygen tanks to breathe so that they can look for water on the moon ","ah ok so maybe i didn't like read read the article you know so i don't really know "
22230,120.3,Luis,,"okay do you think you could go back and reread the article and then complete your answer ","yeah yeah okay i guess i can do that "
22235,120.4,Chris,,"okay all right how did class else do with their answers could you ","oh yeah okay so for mine i said i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment including oxygen tanks and masks and suits but they used a small machine and a microscope to look at the water on the moon because it was microscopic "
22238,420.2,Chris,,"So, now that we you've described what the equipment looks like do you think you could tell me a little bit more about why they were a gathering all this equipment and going to the moon, to look for water in the first place? ","oh i don't know if the story told us why they were doing that "
22241,210.4,Chris,,"ok well why do you think they were going there to look for water ","um i don't know because at first i thought it was so that they could like we could live on the moon um but that wouldn't make sense i did i did read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22243,210.4,Jazmin,,,"i don't think that we can live on the moon i don't think that that wouldn't make sense "
22245,230.1,Jazmin,,"why wouldn't it make sense ","because like i said about the atmosphere like there isn't an atmosphere around the moon so we can't like there's nothing that would protect us we will die "
22248,140.1,Jazmin,,"well what's something that you could bring with you to the moon so that you might not die ","you mean like spacesuits "
22251,140.1,Jazmin,,"how do you think you would do if you were on the moon ","um well i mean i guess i wouldn't die but i wouldn't want to like you know like live in a space suit like all the time that would be like really uncomfortable "
22254,140.1,Farrah,,,"yeah i'm still confused "
22257,230.1,Farrah,,"okay what are you confused about ","well okay so student said that in his answer it was the small machine and the microscope but i thought that the microscope was the right answer "
22260,210.3,Farrah,,"so were there other things that the astronauts used to look for water other than the microscope ","i have i had the small machine as my answer and that one i think was right too "
22262,230.3,Farrah,,"ok so you both said the small machine ","which one is right then the microscope or jazmin's "
22266,130.3,Farrah,,"because you need the small machine to find the water and then you need the microscope to study the water ","oh ok ok so then i should i have to put both of them in my answer "
22275,120.4,Oliver,,"and student how's your answer doing ","um well i've just been kind of listening to what class else was saying um so i haven't changed mine yet um um i guess i don't have as much background knowledge as the rest of them because you know i don't really like read books about space and stuff like i fly on airplanes but i don't like like read about the moon or like the environment or anything um so so yeah i guess um uh huh "
22278,120.4,Oliver,,"yeah so could you tell me your answer again ","um yeah well i had circled the same thing as student i circled that last sentence in paragraph three you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22280,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah and what do you need to use to find the water and before you study it with the microscope ","the small machine that student said "
22283,420.2,Oliver,,"yeah so you can include that and then maybe also talk about why we would need to look for water on the moon ","okay so add in the name add in the part that student said add in why we're looking for water and what was the last thing you said "
22286,420.2,Jazmin,,,"maybe living on the moon is that one of the ones "
22289,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah oh yes you're right why why we need to live on the moon ","oh oh ok ok um oh well it's actually it's time for us to go to lunch so i'll have to finish my answer after lunch yeah thanks teacher i am thinking though like i do i appreciate like how you you took the time to kind of explain how we can make our ideas a little bit better so i at least know what i need to work on next time i come back to class "
22291,110.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
22294,150.1,Luis,,"hi class so i just got through looking over your responses and i just wanted to probe a little bit deeper so student look at yours again ","um yeah um i shouldn't be and this class i already know all about space "
22298,230.2,Luis,,"yes actually i'm in i'm glad that you said that student because looking at your response when you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks right um i think that that is a great observation i was wondering where you saw that in the text ","um okay um well it wasn't really a story but i just know that if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon i know they have oxygen tanks "
22304,230.2,Farrah,,"That was, and thank you again because I did want to talk about that Luis. Farrah yours, was also really interesting because you talked about the microscope, can you tell me a little bit more about what you found that in the text. ","oh yeah okay well i found it in part three where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22306,210.4,Farrah,,"mm hmm absolutely so how do we have you ever used the microscope before ","yeah yeah we have them on in our science classroom "
22308,210.3,Farrah,,"yes i think they're really cool so if you thinking about a microscope from where you are right now using that do you think you would be able to see something on the moon like that far away just like the water on the moon that far away ","from earth no way "
22314,210.4,Farrah,,"and i don't want you to answer it now i want you to take a second to look through the text again but what do you think help the scientists be able to see it ","ok i'll look "
22316,230.1,Oliver,,"okay and student you had something you have a similar idea as student so can you tell me what also what brought you to that same conclusion ","yeah so well i was thinking on how could you discover something if you can't see it you need to see it to discover "
22321,210.4,Jazmin,,"how can you how do you get to the point where you can use the microscope right because if you're just carrying around a microscope looking for all these small things you're gonna be looking for a long time so we have to look at the text ","So I had a different answer and answer as NASA sent a small machine and I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
22331,420.3,Jazmin,,"I will, I want you to think about is how can your answer be more specific and what could you find in the text again evidence from that text that's going to give you an opportunity to be even more specific. ","i'm gonna try right now i should look again "
22334,120.1,Chris,,"you can look at yes i would love for you to look again just take a second there's no pressure ","yeah well so since we're talking about equipment on i wanted to say i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks but also um masks and suits "
22343,120.1,Chris,,"You want to think about the tool, the most effective for that particular situation so when we're trying to find the water right so look, I want you to take a second to look through the text again as well, and just see if you can find something. ","okay yeah yeah that math example that really make sense all look again "
22345,120.4,Farrah,,"student and student how's it going as far as you're looking through the text ","okay so um i'm beginning to think that maybe instead of the microscope it's it's the machine i'm that student was talking about "
22347,130.2,Jazmin,,"student um how does that sound to you what do you think ","um yeah and then you told me to to add more specific stuff to my answer so i found a little more and i would add that the machine is called a lunar orbiter and they use it to investigate "
22351,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome and student and i know that you and student were working together oh yes i see your hand go ahead ","um yeah i just looked at the clock and unfortunately we have to go to lunch right now um but i know i'm going to do because this was really really fun um i wanted to say thank you so much for really encouraging us to probe deeper into the text and find more specifics for our answer that was really helpful and also you just made it really fun so thank you so much "
22359,140.1,Luis,,"student do you speak spanish ","well i'm a little bit i can try "
22361,140.1,Jazmin,,"okay student do you speak spanish ","yes i do "
22363,140.1,Jazmin,,"great student can you teach us the spanish word for moon ","and spanish word for me is luna "
22365,210.4,Luis,,"yeah exactly and so today you read a text about the lunar orbiter and if you look inside the word lunar where do you see ","so yeah it's got all the lunar thing in it um but i shouldn't even be in this class i know all about space "
22370,120.2,Oliver,,"student i see your hand class take a look what word do you see inside of the word polar ","and ok i see the word pole "
22372,210.4,Oliver,,"okay and when you hear the word pole what does that make you think of student ","i'm like the north pole "
22374,210.4,Oliver,,"uh huh and so if we're looking at polar craters on the moon where are they going to be located ","like on the top and the bottom "
22384,130.2,Farrah,,"and then student you're going to build ","okay so this paragraph it tells us well i guess we learned that the loon has poles and that that's where the water is in the craters "
22386,130.2,Chris,,"okay student can you build ","oh well the craters they're dark "
22388,210.4,Chris,,"okay and what is inside of the creators student ","and the water "
22393,210.4,Jazmin,,"what are we learning from this paragraph ","so this is this is where i found my answer actually to the question we learned that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22395,430.2,Jazmin,,"okay so i want you to look back in the paragraph it's not that your answer is wrong it's that it lacks some detail so what can you add to your answer when you look at that paragraph again ","okay well it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22398,210.4,Jazmin,,"great so can you tell me more about what the lunar orbiter must look like and what it's doing ","well i don't really know what it looks like but it sounds like it it can find that ice in the craters "
22400,210.4,Chris,,"So who is sending the Lunar orbiter when you look at paragraph two ","think it's nasa and oh actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists who they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22404,210.4,Chris,,"what is nasa specifically sending in paragraph to ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
22406,210.4,Chris,,"to do what student ","oh well i think student said it goes in the craters and finds the the water "
22408,210.4,Chris,,"good so i'm going to add that to my visualization i know nasa which student knows so much about ","that i got a shirt with that picture on it and everything "
22416,120.2,Luis,,"student i appreciate the hand up class look back at your paragraph who found that water ","so i think nasa because that's who's doing this but also i just i just looked at our clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say this was so cool like the drawing you made that really helped me sort of see that text in my mind and i think since i love space so much next time i read about space i'm going to do that same thing and draw myself a picture to help me understand it "
22419,150.1,Luis,,"alright so i heard some great ideas from the class thank you all for sharing why don't we start with student and student so i saw some actually before we get there student you have a hand up do you have a question for me ","yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22424,230.2,Farrah,,"seeing nods thank you thank you so why don't we start with student and student i saw you class had some consensus where in the text did you find that scientists need a microscope to look closely at water can either student or student read that sentence for us ","yes i can do that "
22426,230.2,Farrah,,,"it was in part three where we found it it says the water they found us microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and then it says our answer you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22430,210.4,Oliver,,"in the sentence student read are the scientists what are they using the microscope for ","yeah well since i was thinking the same thing as student they're using the microscope to be able to see the tiny pieces of ice "
22435,130.2,Jazmin,,"thank you student for sharing your thought process do other students in the class agree disagree want to push back feel free to throw your hand up if you want to share thoughts on what we just heard ","so i'm sorry you two but i disagree because my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why that answer is wrong "
22437,230.2,Jazmin,,"can you tell us where in the text student you found this information ","let me see the first sentence in part two "
22439,120.3,Jazmin,,"okay and can you read that out loud for us please ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22441,210.4,Luis,,"thank you student for reading from the text so now we have two ideas on the table that it was a microscope or this small machine what is the small machine called let's give it a name um someone can identify what is the name of this small machine student you have a hand up ","lunar orbiter "
22445,230.1,Jazmin,,"student do you want to explain a little more about why you disagree before we hear from other people ","okay well so the one i picked the lunar lunar orbiter it it had the word investigate it said they use the lunar orbiter to investigate and investigate is kind of like find so i thought they had to use the lunar orbiter to find the water and it says it's in the craters "
22447,130.2,Chris,,"thank you student for sharing your thought processes let's see student i haven't heard from you today do you agree with student that we can also use the word find or discover for investigate ","oh yeah oh those words mean pretty much the same thing "
22450,150.1,Chris,,"thank you student class disagree or want to push back on that or we all agree that these two words can be used as synonyms ","so can i add something too about equipment yeah well so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22455,230.2,Luis,,"Keep in mind the evidence for this question should come from the text. Our items, did anyone see oxygen tank mentioned anywhere in the text? If you see it feel free to raise your hand if you want to share where that was found. I'm seeing a shake head from Oliver. ","i don't think that's in here student "
22460,120.2,Farrah,,"keep in mind the question is what did scientists use to discover water on the moon after talking about the word investigate discover and look closely what do we think the final answer is what equipment did scientists use so for this one i'm going to call on student ","ok so the stuff about investigate that makes sense i can see why the lunar orbiter is finding because they use the word investigate but i guess what i was kind of thinking before is how can they find it if they can't see it yet "
22463,210.3,Farrah,,"so student excellent analysis but they did need the microscope to look closely at it but for that first discovery what did they need ","the orbiter "
22467,150.1,Oliver,,"so does class have questions or want to disagree with that statement student you have a hand up what are you thinking ","well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch and i'm kind of bummed because this was really fun but i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for really helping us understand what all the different words in the text and in the question what they mean because that really helped me figure out what the best answer was thank you so much "
22470,150.1,Farrah,,,"oh hi hello "
22473,150.1,Luis,,"so it's really nice to have you all in a small class together i know you just read your passage on water on the moon oh yes student ","um yeah i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22475,110.3,Luis,,"um i think it's good to talk about this what we read together so we can help us help each other understand it more so it's great that you know a lot about space maybe you can share that with us ","um yeah i can do that sure "
22484,120.4,Farrah,,"does class have any thoughts ","oh yeah okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22487,230.2,Farrah,,"mm-hmm and what made you think that from the passage ","okay well so in part in part three it says that the water they found is microscopic and so you need the microscope if you were going to look at it and see it "
22490,210.4,Farrah,,"can you think of can you think of a place in the passage where they talked about going to find the location of the water ","oh well so i guess what i'm thinking is how could you find it if if you can't see "
22492,210.4,Jazmin,,"right so i think they needed to find it by exploring different parts of the moon yes student ","well i i had a different answer and maybe will help student so i said that nasa sent a small machine and so and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22494,230.2,Jazmin,,"it's not wrong maybe let's look at that part together can you tell us where you saw that in the passage ","yes definitely i found it in part two "
22498,210.4,Luis,,"did class catch what it was called ","um yeah i got it it said well i mean you just read it it says lunar orbiter that's the name "
22502,150.1,Oliver,,"does that makes sense ","i'm still a little confused cuz i said the same as student i said the microscope um and so i'm still a little unsure why it's the lunar orbiter that's the right answer and how i would how i would have picked that on my own i think i would still pick the microscope "
22505,150.1,Oliver,,"does that help clarify ","yeah so it's like first they get and find the tiny water with the orbiter and then they look at it with a microscope "
22508,210.4,Chris,,"right they looked at it with the microscope to look closely and learn more about it ","oh okay yeah i wanted to say so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22510,110.3,Chris,,"yeah wow thanks for sharing that that's a that's a great connection that you made with the reading ","yeah it was an amazing trip we got to see so many different things there "
22512,120.2,Jazmin,,"mm-hmm so how about we move on to the second question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","and wait i just so with with my answer about the machine why what i still don't get why i was wrong i said nasa sent a small machine "
22514,430.2,Jazmin,,"yes oh you did say that yeah so they did send a small machine but there's a lot of different small machines that could have been sent so that's why we want to be specific when we're answering these questions ","oh so and all i had to do was just say the name of it "
22517,420.2,Jazmin,,"um it would be helpful to elaborate and add more details to your response but it was a great start good job student ","oh okay great that's helpful for next time thank you "
22521,420.2,Chris,,,"so well i just i looked at the clock and actually we we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say before before we go that we really appreciate how you took the time to really explain the difference between finding the water and looking at the water because it makes so much more sense how to find the right answer when you explain that so thank you so much "
22524,150.1,Luis,,"hi student and jen and student and student he said i'm excited to talk to you today we were talking about earlier with discovering water on the moon so student oh yes even what would you like to say ","i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22526,110.3,Luis,,"oh that is awesome student i'm so glad you are so interested in space could you help maybe me and some of your classmates learn a little about how we discover water on the moon do you know how we do ","um yeah okay well we we sent a machine into space and we needed all sorts of equipment and we needed oxygen tanks and we needed a microscope all we needed all sorts of things and they they sent the rocket and it smashed into the moon and they found little pieces of ice "
22529,110.3,Chris,,"whoa whoa that sounds really exciting that definitely sounds exciting but definitely some you had some great things about there ","well my answer my answer is a scientist they found craters full of water on the moon so there's definitely water there "
22533,210.4,Oliver,,"that are there and you're right that they have now very tiny particles of water they have not found just lots of water in the moon the moon is one of the driest places in the world ","yeah yeah my family we went up on a trip we went to the grand canyon and it was really hot there and really sandy on the sand at would blow around and got in your eyes it was so hot and the sun was beating down and it was just dry and sand everywhere that you looked "
22537,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah student what would you like to add ","well i'm i'm a little confused because i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope in order to look really closely for my answer and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22542,210.4,Farrah,,"when we go there we dig deep and find kind of the soil and everything to get to that ice so we can't just use a microscope that had to be some other things for us to be able to get to that place ","oh okay yes so they need something else first and then they look at that through the microscope "
22545,210.4,Farrah,,"yes you're right right so we just have to have some extra they can't just like you know maybe you class have used microscopes in your class before ","That makes sense, thank you. "
22547,120.4,Oliver,,"you're welcome welcome student we haven't heard from you i see um ","well i was talking about the grand canyon i was talking about remember "
22550,120.4,Jazmin,,"if you were to go to the moon student what would you do to try to water there what would you do student ","i would use the small machine that nasa sent and i would use it to get the samples that you need to find the water "
22552,130.2,Luis,,"also yes you are so right can class help right what is that machine call that nasa ","oh we know this i know this "
22554,130.2,Luis,,,"i got it "
22557,130.2,Luis,,,"yeah it's the lunar orbiter student it's right there in the article like right under your nose it's called the lunar orbiter "
22561,120.4,Chris,,"student what do you have to add ","i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22564,210.4,Farrah,,"and so with the oxygen tanks let's go why would they need oxygen tanks on the moonso let's go back to student what they need oxygen tanks on the moon ","well they needed it to breathe "
22570,130.2,Luis,,"is there anything else they'd need to find that water ","while you you said they had to dig down really deep so i don't know if the lunar orbiter does that or something else does that but they would need something to get under the soil and find the little teeny tiny tiny teeny tiny teeny ice "
22573,110.2,Oliver,,"perfect yes you are so right they would absolutely need something to do with that so yeah the lunar orbiter might do that as well so we're going to take some different places and i think that would go with it as well help help them dig down yeah student what do you think ","um yeah i'm so sorry um i just looked up a clock and we actually we have to put a lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand how each one of our answers fit into the process of discovering water on the moon like i have a really good picture of all the different steps that they need and how each equipment works and that was really helpful so thank you so much "
22576,150.1,Luis,,"alright students so we just talked a little bit about the type of machinery they use to discover the water on the moon and i think we need to yes student ","um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22580,110.3,Luis,,"so you'll be able to use your background knowledge to really help us understand. Okay? ","yeah okay "
22583,210.4,Chris,,"alright cool so let's think a little bit more about what we read who could give me a quick summary of the text two to three sentences ","okay well so to summarize the story the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon "
22586,210.4,Chris,,"okay can you tell me how they found it ","um okay um well i guess they had to use some some equipment um like um i think a microscope maybe it said "
22593,120.2,Farrah,,"all right come back together class now that we've had a chance to look back at our passage let's review our question again okay what was the type what was the name of the machine that supported the scientists in finding the water on the moon ","well um i don't know if you'd call it a machine really but um i i found the same thing that student um what he kind of just said i think it said you'd need a microscope to look really closely so i'm i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22595,230.2,Farrah,,"okay perfect so let's look closely at that sentence student where do you see in the story that says it was a microscope where exactly in the story ","okay so that's in part three the last part it says the water they found is microscopic and it says you need a microscope to see it "
22601,130.2,Jazmin,,"so i just want to zero back in on a different part of the story did class find a different part of the story that gives us information about the tool ","okay well in part two they they actually talked about a small machine "
22603,230.2,Jazmin,,"can you tell us where exactly that is you can read the sentence for us ","okay the first sentence in part two says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22611,120.4,Chris,,"okay okay put your hand down so student what are you thinking ","well i'm i'm thinking that so actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22616,230.1,Luis,,"I heard Jazmin I saw Jazmin and Luis raise their hand for the lunar orbiter. Could you explain to the group, one of you, why you think that is what it was called? ","okay yeah so i think it's the lunar orbiter because the lunar orbiter i think it's kind of like this robot and it kind of does everything and then there isn't like a microscope on the moon because um microscope it's like a really small and you can't just walk around the whole moon with a microscope and look at all of it to find the water first you need the robot to tell you where the water is "
22619,120.3,Jazmin,,"and student can you just point us back to that sentence that you read in the story and read that for us again ","yes nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22623,210.3,Farrah,,"do you now see what the name of that tool was called ","yeah yeah this makes this makes a lot more sense now it makes sense that the the machine the lunar orbiter they had to use that to to find the water discover it like it says in the question on that makes a lot more sense "
22625,530.1,Oliver,,"mm hmm so let's just think about as a class like what did we do together what do we do together to figure out what the name of that tool was called student ","okay so what we did is we we reread we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question "
22627,420.3,Oliver,,"yes absolutely so sometimes you do have to weigh the actions and figure out what is the best evidence which one really lets me know the answer to this question and helps me understand this text okay ","i'm so sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock on and we actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at the text and understand it and reminding us how to use the text to find the best answer that was really helpful "
22631,110.3,Luis,,"alright good afternoon students i was just reading over your responses and what i noticed is that you all are doing a really great job answering the question especially using some of the background knowledge that you know about space and about the moon what yes student ","yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22636,120.4,Farrah,,"who would like to share one of theirs the response that they gave to that question ","okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22644,120.4,Farrah,,"student what did you come up with ","um well so i said the same thing as student about the microscope um because that's a scientific tool and they talked about in the story yeah i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22647,120.3,Oliver,,"so student can you read the question again that we're working to answer ","mhmm yeah what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22649,210.4,Farrah,,"okay and student you said it was a microscope can you find a place in the text that tells us it was a microscope that found the water on the moon ","yeah okay um at the very end part three um the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22654,210.4,Jazmin,,"is there another place in the story or the text that we found that talks about a scientific tool ","in part two it talks about a small machine and that was my answer "
22658,310.1,Jazmin,,"okay student i see you located a specific piece of the text that was a good move ","i think it was in there um let me look nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22663,120.4,Chris,,"student what do you think ","well so um so in there it talks about that lunar orbiter but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22667,210.1,Chris,,"that is absolutely right and in this question we are looking for the machine that found the water on the moon ","well i guess it's a lunar orbiter um because that's what student said and it was in part two "
22669,120.4,Oliver,,"okay student what do you think ","yeah well um it's sort of sounding like lunar orbiter's the right answer um but i still think there's evidence about the microscope um how can you find something if it's too small to see don't you need a microscope "
22676,210.3,Luis,,"so let's think was the lunar orbiter the machine that found the water or was it a microscope that found the water ","um i think i think it was the lunar orbiter that found the water um i think because they says it's the thing that um looked in the craters and like found it in the first place i don't know how it works like maybe it's some kind of robot but i think it can do it all by itself "
22679,110.1,Farrah,,"hmm um what are you thinking student ","um well okay so it sounds like the lunar orbiter can find really small things and then maybe they just look at it with the microscope after they find it "
22682,210.4,Oliver,,"and it's and it is saying that the water that they found was really small so it's just letting us know that it was a small amount that they found student ","yeah i'm so sorry but it's time for us to know "
22685,210.4,Chris,,,"oh hi good morning "
22687,210.4,Chris,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
22689,210.4,Luis,,,"that'd be yeah so um i shouldn't be and as a class i already know all about space "
22694,110.3,Luis,,"that's great and i love that you already know a lot about space but what i think is ","great yeah that sounds awesome "
22696,150.1,Farrah,,"love the um does class else have any questions before we dive into the discussion prompt that you'll have given me answers for student house and the student are you good ","yeah i think we're ready to go "
22702,120.3,Farrah,,"student can you read the question for me ","yeah okay so it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22705,210.2,Oliver,,"so before we dive into the question i want to ask one of you what is your understanding of the word equipment what do you think it means give me an example of equipment from maybe your daily life ","okay so um it as like a tool or something you use to do something i'm so like in math class sometimes we use a calculator so that would be a equipment "
22708,230.1,Farrah,,"student can you tell me do you want to read out your answer maybe we can all decide as a class we can come up with what the best answer is um so in your answer you thought this equipment was a microscope so can you help me think why you did that answer what led you to thinking that ","yeah so okay in part three it says that will basically it says the water is really small it's they said might grow scott peck and so you can't see it if you don't have a microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22711,230.1,Oliver,,"i read that you have the same answer student what was your reasoning was it the same did you have the same reason ","i was pretty much the same what caused the question asked what equipment they used to discover the water and i don't think you can discover something if you can't even see it so that's why i was saying to you need the microscope "
22714,130.2,Jazmin,,"now let's try to learn some appeals and see maybe what someone else said and we can come to the closest answer so student can you tell us what your answers and why did you pick that answer ","Okay, I said NASA send a small machine and I picked it from part two, because it says they use the machine to investigate and I thought that sounded kind of close to the question. "
22716,230.1,Luis,,"okay amazing our event so you don't you know a lot about science and space so can you help me understand why did you pick the arms you did and what do you think of your peers on so so far ","um yeah so i mean their interests are pretty good but i was thinking that you'd need an oxygen tank because if there are astronauts and scientists on the moon they cannot sign anything without oxygen tanks "
22720,120.3,Chris,,"So Luis said, I understand that let's let's go back and read the text just see where can we find this evidence in the text Chris, do you want to add to something before we move up yeah go ahead. ","yeah yeah cuz it kind of goes with what student said because i went to nasa actually and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits "
22729,120.3,Farrah,,"okay you can get to drive so don't feel don't don't be afraid go ahead yeah student would you like to just read the text for us again ","okay nasa center some more machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
22735,210.4,Oliver,,"lovely so can someone tell me what is is made up off ","yeah i'm ice it's the same as water um and i i just i looked at the clock and i'm so sorry cuz i really wanted to get to the vote and all that stuff but we have to go to lunch right now um i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really understood why we set our answers and you made us feel like our thinking it really matter and that made this so much easier like we weren't afraid to say the wrong thing or something like that so thank you so much "
22739,210.4,All,,,"we're good we're really excited to work with you today "
22741,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22745,310.1,Luis,,"you class are already providing the evidence you class already circled the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the questions so student why don't i just start off with you ","sure sounds great "
22747,120.4,Luis,,"all right do you have the answer in front of you would you like to share with the whole class ","yeah so i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
22749,150.1,Luis,,"beautiful do you have a text in front of you as well ","yeah yeah it's right here "
22751,230.2,Luis,,"awesome now my question to be where'd you get the answer from did you get the evidence to support that did you get a text evidence ","i'm so um i mean i already know some stuff and if there are scientists on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
22757,120.3,Jazmin,,"so how about why don't why don't we carefully look at the number of paragraph two can you can can student use that paragraph two can you read it out loud for us ","go right ahead so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar greater these ice deposits are very small and so that's where my answer came from actually i said nasa center small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
22760,210.4,Jazmin,,"all the actually says very clear in the second paragraph can you so if you circle back to the paragraph to as as nasa sent the small machine and what is that called student ","lunar orbiter "
22762,130.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so that will be the answer ","oh so just have to add the name in there too "
22764,310.1,Jazmin,,"yeah and you found the text evidence as well you did an excellent job all right you did you did either disappear job excellent ","thank you "
22766,120.4,Chris,,"awesome are why don't we move on to student student would you like to read out loud your answer ","and you know okay so up i said scientists found critters full of water on the moon "
22771,430.1,Chris,,"the question was actually what equipment were the scientists using so i think next time student what you can do you can actually circle the question statements ","yeah well about equipment um so i actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22775,230.3,Chris,,"and also that actually ties into luis's experience student knows all about it he's very interested in that's how he made the connection with oxygen tank is that right even ","oh yeah exactly um i like to watch a youtube videos "
22778,120.4,Oliver,,"right is really excellent tool all right um oliveron thank def thank you for waiting patiently would you like to go with your answer do you mind sharing your answer with the whole class ","yeah i can share so same thing so and that is the microscope i think that answer is actually the microscope "
22780,230.2,Oliver,,"hard to find an answer from ","um okay so it actually talks about a microscope and part three and because it says on water is really small so you would need a microscope to look at it really closely "
22784,120.3,Farrah,,"yeah yeah and since you and student you class are agreeing each other can i have student read the third paragraph ","that means the moon is still dryer and the driest desert on earth the water they found is micro scapa meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it and here's the part i circled you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22786,230.1,Farrah,,"awesome great great great so um is student said is that the reason why you chose the same answer ","yeah yeah i found it there too because you can't find something if you can't see it you need the microscope "
22790,110.2,Oliver,,"microscope okay so i do lot love the oliveron and student you class are making the connections with microscope because yes you are correct because in order to look at it closely you need it you that's the scientific tool that you need go ahead oliveron ","um yeah so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much i feel like you gave each one of us a strategy to help make our answer better on and that was really helpful thank you "
22795,110.2,Luis,,,"hi i'm excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22798,120.4,Luis,,"so yes would you like to share with your response to begin with ","yeah "
22801,120.4,Luis,,,"okay um i don't remember okay let me look at my paper i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks yeah "
22809,120.4,Chris,,"all right does class would like to share the answer ","and i think the answer is all let me see what scientists found craters for water on the moon "
22817,430.1,Chris,,"my concern is that you didn't read the question correctly because the question is that i want you to identify the object we're looking for and i want you to do so by circling equipment ","what do you want me to do "
22821,420.3,Chris,,"and i'll underline the sentence where scientists use us to discover water on the moon. ","okay equipment underlying in the story or underlining the question "
22823,420.3,Chris,,,"okay so i circled equipment and i underlined us to discover water on the moon "
22825,110.1,Jazmin,,"good so in this question whatever you're looking for student i'll get back to you in a minute one second okay ","okay "
22827,110.1,Jazmin,,,"i thought you said you would get back to me in a minute so i put my hand down "
22829,110.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay well i didn't understand why my answer was wrong "
22831,120.4,Jazmin,,"what was your answer can you share that with us again ","yeah i said masses into small machine "
22837,420.3,Jazmin,,"my feedback for you is that every time you read a passage and the questions given to you i want you to reread the passage again and the corresponding tasks and then tell me your answer ","and i read it two times i did because i know "
22840,420.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah the teacher told us that strategy you know you read it you read the question and then you read it again i just i forgot to put the name "
22842,420.2,Jazmin,,"on the machine o h that's okay next time can you please give us a specific name for the machine that's all ","okay yeah i can do that that's easy "
22844,310.1,Chris,,"awesome great job explaing that the small machine wasn't necessarily a small machine and you did a really great job showing me how you understood the text ","yeah i was thinking about equipment since a circle that in the text and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22848,230.1,Chris,,"i really so good good all right now so have you heard about this story before or is it your first time hearing this about finding water and the moon yeah ","this is my my first time because we we learned about the mars rover and like the things that go to mars but i didn't know about water on the moon "
22851,230.2,Jazmin,,"shall we just go back and see together since i didn't go with three other answers so we could definitely do that so student can you tell us what the paragraph you find the answer from ","i found the answer in the second paragraph "
22854,230.2,Jazmin,,"how do you know that how do you know that the answer actually is in the second paragraph ","um cuz i was looking for equipment right and so when i was reading i only saw two places in paragraph two or they see a small machine and then paragraph three where they see the microscope but the question and i went back to the question and says to discover water right and then in the second sentence it says the herbal will look for ice deposit so looking for is the same thing as discovering i think "
22863,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah i'm so proud of you you would that really impressed me okay student i'm sorry have you to wait for a while so go right ahead you have any question ","no teacher i'm sorry but it's actually time for us to go "
22865,110.1,Oliver,,,"yeah "
22872,120.4,Luis,,"about the previous texts and science class okay all right student i have your response up here would you like to share out loud with the whole class so we can go ahead yes student ","yeah excuse me i'm okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
22877,150.1,Luis,,"and i love to hear from two other scholars and you you can also comment on it and you can also share your thoughts whenever while you're raising your hands but um ","okay can i go back to my seat since i i fixed mine "
22880,120.4,Farrah,,"awesome student go ahead ","okay yeah um so my answer was that all you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22887,310.1,Farrah,,"sure okay i love that you gave the answer and it will really impressed me was that you capture the word microscope from the passage an important keyword there ","because i was looking for the keywords equipment oh discover water on the moon and this one had it had a microscope which is equipment and then it says in the second sentence the water they found is microscopic and found is kind of like discovered and then it's also about water on the moon "
22889,230.2,Farrah,,"right right very important did you get that did you get the answer from which paragraph again ","from paragraph three "
22895,230.3,Farrah,,"and then it looks like a little machine sounds like a little machine and it has a scientific tools who may just think that it was a scientific tool the little machine and you also found found verve and water say major think that's the answer but ","yeah sorry teacher it wasn't that it was a machine, I guess, my science teacher might see that it is, but I was looking for equipment. because that was the word in the question and i know microscope is equipment because that's what we say when we get out the microscopes and science class "
22899,120.3,Farrah,,"so let's start from the beginning so if you go back to the question i love to have you wide so why don't you try reading the question again ","Okay um what equipment and scientists used to discover water on the moon. "
22901,420.1,Farrah,,"and underline to discover water, the moon right. ","okay yeah i feel like i'm i'm still confused because did i do that in my answer "
22906,410.3,Farrah,,"so hearing what you wrote i think you you got the words microscopic and lunar orbiter mixed up from the text ","oh but but i did i had all the keywords i had equipment discover water on the moon i'm still confused "
22908,130.3,Farrah,,"uh huh the machine that we use to find water and the moon is called a lunar orbiter that's why I think I eat mixed up and pay and paragraph two and three. ","although they also do say microscope in the lessons and the last sentence of paragraph three how come that's not the equipment "
22915,210.4,Chris,,"and the ice deposits become a water and then scientists said that a ton of top layer the moon surface it hold a total about 32 ounces water so i know that it is water being found in the moon and and they also use it to drink water and stuff like that okay okay okay ","and i was thinking about the water on the moon and i were reading about them trying to find it and i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22917,210.4,Chris,,,"yeah um i read at home and one of my science books that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
22922,130.2,Luis,,"yeah great student student do you have any thoughts i know you're all you also have like really enrich background knowledge about this topic do you have any comments to share on top of the student because you can add on to this ","out while i'm and not so much about the moon base but i was thinking about what student was saying about it being the microscope and then you were saying student to answer was right the lunar orbiter and that you know what i thought that they had sent the astronauts to the moon and the story but i actually think that maybe it's just the machine and and not the not the people "
22924,230.3,Luis,,"so you thought about jazmin's answer and then ","yeah i'm thinking maybe the lunar orbiter you know is like the mars rover where class in the rover you know it was just the machine itself and maybe that's the lunar orbiter is too "
22927,310.1,Oliver,,"good i love that you're giving connections and predictions they're great i love it all right student i would like to circle back ","i'm sorry teacher but i was just looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to go on but i did want to say thank you for how are you i'm kept asking our questions to class and took time to explain where you thought that they were on track i guess and where they were off track because now i'm thinking about my answer and maybe where i was off track i'm not sure but at least i'm thinking about it right "
22929,310.1,Oliver,,,"okay thanks teacher "
22933,310.1,Farrah,,,"we're good thank you for asking we're so excited for your class "
22936,150.1,Luis,,"great okay so you class just read a very short article yes student ","um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
22938,140.1,Luis,,"is space something you're interested in student ","oh yeah oh big time i watch all these videos about space on youtube and and i really want to go to space camp and go into the zero gravity chamber oh yeah i really like space "
22941,230.1,Luis,,"but sometimes like in this question they wanted us to find a specific answer in the text so student if you look at the answer to your question your answer to the question can you find that in the text or did you find that appear in your brain because you knew all about space ","well i guess um i guess it was from my brain "
22944,110.3,Luis,,"which is great i'm so excited that you have so many facts up there in your brain ","oh yeah that's right here um what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
22946,120.3,Luis,,"there's a little bit more keep reading ","i don't see anything "
22948,120.2,Luis,,"it doesn't say circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question ","i guess i skipped that part "
22951,110.2,Luis,,"did class see that's the whole question okay so student if the question would have stopped where you were reading your answer would have been 100 right because you circled information in your brain ","hey thanks brain "
22954,120.3,Oliver,,"so once again can student can you read the question one more time for me ","okay yeah okay that's what equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon so all the evidence in the text that we can use to answer this question "
22957,210.2,Jazmin,,"right so who knows just in one word what is this question about what is it asking us about ","asking us about equipment "
22959,210.2,Jazmin,,"you got it so we're gonna have to find a equipment some type of equipment and what did this equipment do ","well it discovers the water and i'm i'm a little confused because i don't know why my answer is wrong "
22961,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay so can you share will you share with the class what your answer was ","yes i said nasa send a small machine "
22963,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay you're right good can you read us the sentence where you where you got that ","yeah okay so um it was in part two and it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
22965,210.4,Jazmin,,"so what was that small machine called ","a lunar orbiter "
22967,210.3,Jazmin,,"so do you think you could add something to your answer student to make it more complete in more correct ","well i guess i could i could just say that name the lunar orbiter "
22969,210.4,Jazmin,,"because what did the lunar orbiter do ","it it looked for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
22972,130.3,Farrah,,"so the lunar orbiter was a piece of equipment that scientist us to discover water on the moon hands up if you agree with ","oh well i had a different piece of equipment i said the microscope and i think that that's the piece of equipment it's a tool and we use it in science class sometimes and it helps you look at really small things like the water on the moon "
22975,210.3,Farrah,,"student you are right that the microscope is a piece of equipment but is the microscope what they use to discover the water on the moon or ","well i guess i was thinking how can you discover it if you can't see it "
22978,210.4,Farrah,,"did you class watch the movie about how the lunar orbiter worked ","no we just we just read this we just read it "
22981,120.3,Farrah,,"okay okay so i can see where this is going to be a little bit confusing um so you're absolutely right that the piece of equipment is a microscope but can you read the sentence that has the word microscope in it student ","i circled it and everything it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
22983,120.3,Chris,,"can you read the sentence before that student ","yeah yeah i can do that right before it says okay the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
22985,210.4,Chris,,"okay so are they really telling us that we need a microscope that they i'm sorry are they telling us we used a microscope or are they telling us that the water was so small we would need a microscope ","it sounds like it sounds like the second one but also but also i i went to nasa so i know that that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
22993,120.4,Oliver,,"student what are you going to circle ","okay well this is so i changed my answer so first i said the microscope like student did but now now i think maybe they were just saying that it's really small so if you want to look at it like if i wanted to look at it i would have to use a microscope but now i think first i had to use the lunar orbiter and um i just wanted to say i i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch actually but i wanted to say thank you so much for being so patient and really explaining to us how our answers were not quite complete and how we could understand the story even better to make our answers even better "
22996,140.1,Luis,,"and student one last thing what was armstrong neil armstrong what did he say when he landed on the moon ","that that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind "
22998,150.1,Luis,,"you class did one small step towards learning and now we did another giant step towards learning so enjoy lunch thanks for coming ","by "
23001,150.1,Farrah,,,"morning we're good today "
23005,230.1,Luis,,"maybe starting with student student could you explain how you came to your answer choice ","um well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23007,140.1,Luis,,"well that's fantastic can you tell me something you know about space ","yeah okay i know they just landed the mars rover "
23013,120.2,Luis,,"how did you get that answer ","well i know after our astronauts up on the mound looking for water they definitely are using oxygen tanks "
23015,230.1,Luis,,"whoa okay why are they definitely using oxygen tanks ","to breathe "
23017,210.3,Luis,,"oh so the oxygen tanks are helping the astronauts survive not really helping the astronauts in discovering the water ","well i mean i guess you need to breathe to discover water that's kind of what i was thinking "
23021,410.1,Luis,,"the question though it did ask us it said what equipment did scientists use and you're talking to me about astronauts ","um astronauts are a type of scientist "
23023,230.1,Luis,,"was that a question or a statement ","not sure "
23028,230.2,Luis,,"so did you get your answer from the article or did you get your answer somewhere else? ","um i guess it's not really in the story "
23030,230.1,Luis,,"where is it ","in my brain "
23032,230.1,Luis,,,"yeah "
23034,210.3,Luis,,"but in this case are we looking for information from your brain or are we looking for information from the article ","i guess the article "
23036,210.3,Luis,,"so what do you think is something you might need to do right now to check your answer ","and read it "
23044,230.1,Farrah,,"i'm going to talk to both Oliver and Farrah because you guys had the same answer so yeah Oliver or Farrah, can you tell me how you are can you guys actually talk to each other and i'll listen about how you came up with that answer choice. ","okay well i found it on student in part three and i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong um yeah i circled that same part student cuz i was thinking that you'd you'd need to be able to see something before you can find it yes we don't understand "
23047,230.1,Farrah,,"student can you tell me a little bit more what do you mean you don't understand what's confusing you right now ","um why isn't the microscope the right answer "
23049,210.3,Farrah,,"so what do you know about a microscope ","oh lets you see things that are really small "
23051,140.1,Farrah,,"okay have you ever used a microscope ","in science "
23057,210.4,Oliver,,"but if we look does it say that the water is on the surface of the moon or that the water is kind of buried underneath ","oh i remember it's in these craters these craters way down where the sun never shines "
23060,210.3,Farrah,,"very good so do you think they took a microscope to the moon to like look around like this to try and find all of that water ","oh that sounds really hard "
23063,430.2,Oliver,,"but it's not the big piece of equipment that we were looking for so can you to reread the passage and see if you can find a bigger piece of equipment that they would have used ","um yeah i wish we park but we actually have to go now um but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today "
23065,430.2,Oliver,,,"sure does "
23068,150.1,Luis,,"hi class i'm so glad that you were able to come join me at for a small class so we can talk a little bit more about what you were just reading and talking about related to the moon so before we start can we oh student did you have a question ","um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23071,120.4,Luis,,"thanks student can you class quickly share what it is that you were just answering about the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon just in a couple of words student can we start with you ","yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
23073,110.1,Jazmin,,"great thanks student what about you ","i said that nasa sent a small machine "
23075,210.3,Jazmin,,"do you remember the name of the small machine ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
23078,310.1,Chris,,"oh great i love that you decided to look back in the text to find out the answer to the question when you weren't sure it's always a great idea ","i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
23080,110.1,Oliver,,"thanks student student ","um yeah so i circled the same answer as savanannah and that's a microscope "
23083,120.4,Farrah,,"ah ok so student are you going to share the same answer as student the microscope too ","um yeah well so my answer is you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
23086,130.2,Farrah,,"as we were talking did any of you remember that some of your peers answers came up in the text too does that sound familiar ","some of them yeah "
23090,140.1,Chris,,"when you class were reading this how did it feel did it feel really easy kind of in the middle or really difficult to read ","um i think it was pretty easy to read "
23092,120.4,Jazmin,,"great student what about you ","i would say that's a kind of medium because well my answer was the small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong why am i in this class "
23098,140.1,Jazmin,,"do you feel like this is a little bit easier to talk to each other in a small class ","yes yes "
23106,120.4,Chris,,"student do you know wat a crater is ","yeah so it's sort of like a whole but it's cooling underground it's kind of like on top of the ground "
23112,230.1,Oliver,,"looks like student saying no it looks like i'm seeing a lot of nos student i'm seeing your head shaking no to why do you think no ","well a crater it's more like um on a piece of nature i don't know if nature is the right word but it's not like something you use or a tool it's just kind of part of the moon "
23115,410.1,Chris,,"yeah absolutely it's kind of part of the moon so it is something that caught the water but it doesn't quite answer a question about it being a piece of equipment that the scientists are using ","yeah well because that was my answer it first about the craters i hear what you mean about equipment on and that made me think about how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use own lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23123,130.2,Luis,,"Luis our space expert Can you help us out. ","um yeah okay so um lunar you class lunar means moon so anytime you see lunar it means about the moon an orbiter is like an orbit it's like it goes around something and it says so the orbiter at looks for the ice i think by going around the moon somehow "
23131,230.3,Oliver,,"student told us that it was a small machine and student added on to that by saying that it has to do with going around the moon ","well actually i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch right now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us read and understand the text so carefully and really look back at it and use it to answer the question i was so helpful thank you so much "
23135,120.4,Luis,,"so we're still talking about the lunar orbiter does class have any thoughts that we didn't bring up before student ","um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23138,110.3,Luis,,"oh of course student but we all want to benefit from your expertise so you know we we like the opportunity to be able to to have you in the class so that we can ask you some questions what did you think about the lunar orbiter ","um well i guess we'll kind of what i was thinking because a question was about the equipment for discovering water on the moon well what i was thinking was actually back on they would need oxygen tanks because how are you going to breathe up on the moon to go discover water if you don't have oxygen tanks "
23147,120.4,Oliver,,"student did you did you what did you think about the lunar orbiter because it's just so amazing like could you imagine the way that this this orbiter is able to reach a part of the moon that we've never been able to reach before i thought that was so interesting ","yeah it's really really interesting um and one thing i thought was really kind of especially interesting about it was that on when they found the water it was so small that was it's um it's less water than on the earth and it's drier than the dry desert even but they're still water there and so but here's my question is because well i wasn't i didn't pick the lunar orbiter for my answer i picked the microscope because the water so small so i don't i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23151,210.4,Jazmin,,"so based on that how was it that they found that there was water on the moon ","okay well hey they sent the small machine and it investigated the craters that deep polar craters and that's where they found the ice deposits "
23153,210.4,Jazmin,,"and student did the machine which is called the lunar orbiter by the way did that have a microscope on it ","oh oh i'm not so sure no i don't think i don't think it told us in the story "
23161,210.4,Farrah,,"what what's that step in between so student can you tell me how is it that that sample is collected and how we get from you know the lunar orbiter existing and then being able to look at a sample of the moon under a microscope could you go ahead and tell me that student ","well i can try it's kind of i guess but i guess probably that lunar orbiter it must like take take samples take pieces maybe of the ice or maybe pictures or or like scans of the moon somehow and that it takes that on that what's the word evidence back to the lab and then they use the microscope which makes so much more sense "
23166,110.2,Chris,,"that's that's exactly right student the one thing that that you said that i want to clarify as you mentioned ","yeah well it's actually a comment on so i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits "
23171,210.4,Luis,,"why is it called the lunar orbiter by the way why is it that it's called that do you think ","yeah well i definitely got this okay lunar means moon and orbiter means it like it goes around because that's what an orbit is "
23175,110.1,Oliver,,"that's exactly right that's exactly right so you know we have this lunar orbiter yes student ","i'm sorry yeah um so actually i just looked at the clock um and we have to go to lunch but on before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for explaining that missing step and the article because it makes so much more sense now when they use the orbiter and then how they use the microscope and so now i really understand how how our answers could have been better and how the article could have been better so thank you so much "
23180,110.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
23185,110.1,Luis,,,"i'm good but excuse me i shouldn't be in this space "
23189,150.1,Luis,,"is that you mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like lots of oxygen tanks and i wanted to hear a little bit more about some of the other equipment they use and just kind of get your perspective on it and start a conversation with your classmates ","okay "
23197,120.4,Luis,,"so can you tell us a little bit about some of the equipment that was mentioned in the article ","oh in the article i was going to tell you more equipment that i know I know you spacesuits and I know they use gravity boots. in because it's really really cold out in space and you could die equipment equipment equipment okay there is a small machine called a lunar orbiter in paragraph two and there's a microscope in paragraph three "
23203,210.4,Luis,,"For you, you know you were able to maybe fill in some of the gaps that the author of the article left out so give me a sense of what you took away from this article. ","um okay um so i guess i didn't read it that much because i felt like i already knew most of the stuff "
23206,120.3,Jazmin,,"and take a couple of minutes to read it while i connect with your fellow space enthusiasts classmates and maybe you can also kind of keep an ear open while you're reading and and get a sense of what your classmates got out of it so student what yes student ","i understand why my answer is wrong "
23212,120.3,Jazmin,,"there is paragraph two could you go ahead and look at paragraph two ","oh yeah i could i could write the whole sentence nasa's into small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate that is that right "
23214,210.4,Jazmin,,"yes you could definitely say that they sent the lunar orbiter to investigate and why did they have to send the lunar orbiter what's the purpose of the lunar orbiter and what is it really besides a small machine ","the purpose is to find ice deposits in a large polar crater "
23218,110.4,Chris,,"that's correct that's correct very good student ","I thought it was pretty cool you know, like the idea of finding water on the moon, and then maybe people you know if we if we use all the water on our planet, you know, then, then we could go to the moon, and we could have people drink water and astronauts could have water there so yeah. "
23221,210.3,Chris,,"so student do you think you know you mentioned some pretty some pretty big goals there in that in that idea do you think we're ready to do that you know in a year you think we're set up for that well ","no no not not not now because they're not close to it yet i don't think um but well i went to nasa and i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23226,130.2,Oliver,,"student could you help me explain a little bit more to your classmates about why it is that you know the water on the moon is still too early for chris's goals ","yeah cuz in paragraph six they talk about how it'll take a lot of time and a lot of money and so that means that they don't have the time or the money yet so it's it's clearly not ready yet "
23229,210.4,Oliver,,"is there something else is is there a reason that it would cost a lot of money in particular that you see in the article in paragraph six ","water scientists need to come up with a plan for extracting are getting it out of the polar craters making this planet tickle at all so they don't even know how to get the water out "
23234,120.3,Oliver,,"that's that's right there in that paragraph to you keep reading a little bit more ","like oh they want me to study the surface and don't know Cars it takes a while to build something like I have a whole like Lego house and ship and boat at my house and we're still working on it, because it takes a long time to build thing. "
23238,150.1,Oliver,,"and we're going to continue yeah definitely i really like it we're going to continue talking about legos as a way to help us understand what we're talking about in this article so student what's the difference i'm sorry did somebody say something ","yes me i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go "
23241,150.1,Farrah,,,"is waving goodbye "
23243,150.1,All,,,"bye see you later "
23246,120.2,Luis,,"um so we i just asked you the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23249,110.3,Luis,,"that's great student i love that you're interested in space maybe you can share your knowledge with the rest of the students ","oh wow i know scientists think it was a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
23252,110.1,Farrah,,"they do the they do use oxygen tanks uhmm ","yeah okay so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
23255,210.4,Jazmin,,"and the water molecules on the moon were really tiny ","um so my answer is nasa sent a small machine "
23259,210.4,Luis,,"yeah they did i remember reading that as well does class remember what the machine was called ","i found it right there in the middle it says lunar orbiter "
23262,210.4,Luis,,"has class heard those words before ","oh yeah well i definitely have "
23264,210.4,Luis,,"do you know what those words mean do you know what lunar means ","uhm lunar means lunar means the moon "
23267,120.4,Chris,,"does class have any ideas student yeah ","yeah so i think is when something sort of goes around something else "
23270,210.4,Farrah,,"exactly orbit is when something moves around something else kind of in a in a circle usually ","well i'm just wondering i mean i said the microscope so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23275,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","so the answer is just both "
23277,110.4,Farrah,,"yeah it is it's both they use both machines both pieces of equipment or tools ","okay okay so um i guess i'm still just not sure how the microscope and the lunar orbiter like how they fit together in the same answer "
23281,210.4,Luis,,"so the lunar orbiter is in space and it looks for these water particles but the water particles are microscopic they're really really tiny so the scientist has to use the microscope as well to be able to see them ","oh okay i'm starting to make a little more sense um yeah so i mean student have to use both because can you imagine like an astronaut walking around the whole moon was just a microscope just a tiny little microscope i mean that wouldn't work "
23283,110.1,Chris,,"thanks for adding student yeah i don't i think they have to use a bunch of different tools to look and so thank you for contributing your opinion student do you have a question ","well i just wanted to share i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23288,120.4,Oliver,,"does class else have any ideas about what other types of equipment scientists use the nasa scientists use ","well i know that down on earth there's people with like on lots of computers and screens on buttons and things "
23292,140.1,Chris,,"buttons and things to control things that are in space because we can't be in space all the time so they use them to control telescopes satellites like i said to see what other things are going on yeah student do you have something to add ","yeah well i have a question sort of about the story so were there actually any astronauts on the moon looking for the water because i wasn't quite clear from the story about that "
23295,210.4,Farrah,,"so they used the equipment to find the water they might have been on the space station or something that was also in space but it sounds like the equipment did a lot of the work ","um so i just looked at the clock and it's it's actually time for us to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for being so interested in everything that each one of us had to say it really felt like you valued everybody's contribution so much so thank you "
23300,150.1,Luis,,"so today we're going to talk about your responses to the reading that we did about nasa ","excuse me i shouldn't be i already know all about space "
23305,140.1,Luis,,"okay i think it'll be really interesting because if you know a lot about space i'm sure you really like it what is your favorite thing about space student ","okay i love watching like the space shuttles take off and go like straight up into space i always watch some youtube videos about that and then how the astronauts can like flow you know "
23310,120.2,Farrah,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","i said that all scientists know i said you need a scientific to hold a microscope to look really closely "
23314,420.1,Jazmin,,"let's look at the question again let's see what is the keyword that's really important class look at the question on your piece of paper and try and find one or two keywords that you think are important to answering the question ","yeah i think equipment is a keyword and so i wrote about equipment and my answer so i don't understand my my answer is wrong "
23318,230.1,Jazmin,,"what can you tell me about your answer ","so it says nasa send to small machine cuz i know that the question was asking us to look for equipment that was looking for water and so in paragraph two i thought that that machine was the equipment "
23324,210.4,Jazmin,," ","lunar orbiter "
23330,120.4,Farrah,,"did class find another piece of equipment or that they said in their answer ","yeah because when you had asked me about what was the words in the question i thought equipment was an important word to so i i said microscope because that's equipment "
23335,230.3,Farrah,,"deb i think you also mentioned the microscope and your response right ","yeah yeah i i was looking for equipment because i thought that was the keyword and i talked about water because i thought water was important a microscope and looking at water in paragraph three so who's right um man student or testament "
23339,130.1,Chris,,"you talked about the microscope but you didn't talk about the lunar orbiter and student you talked about the lunar orbiter but not the microscope and they used a lot of pieces of equipment because it takes a lot of things to find water on the moon it's a big discovery ","yeah i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23342,140.1,Chris,,"that's that's really cool i've never been to nasa but i think that would be a really fun trip what was your favorite part ","it's amazing you can see all of these different space shuttles that have gone to into space for like the past 30 and 40 years and then they have some like little pieces of moon rock that you can you can touch some of them and they have all of these other artifacts from space it is amazing you gotta go "
23346,120.4,Chris,,"yeah i definitely want to go soon so what pieces of equipment did you talk about in your answer student ","oh i fogot the equipment part that i didn't say "
23350,130.1,Chris,,"Of the question we use the equipment that we just talked about the Lunar orbiter and the microscope that Farrah and Oliver and Jazmin talked about to discover the water. ","yeah yeah i did that part but i forgot about the equipment "
23354,420.2,Chris,,"so we want to talk about the equipment in our answer ","i guess i could just add the two names of the machines that on today in in in in student in student said "
23358,210.4,Oliver,,"do you see that in the text where it talks about the kinds of equipment ","yeah student said it was in paragraph three and i see jazmin's in paragraph two i'm sorry to interrupt but it's time for us to go so we'll see you next time okay. "
23363,230.1,Luis,,"um student why don't you tell me why you said that there was convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","okay excuse me okay i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23367,150.1,Jazmin,,"student why don't we listen to our fellow classmates and see what they have to say and maybe we can learn some new things ","okay okay okay so i said that um that it would be valuable because well water is important because astronauts have can drink the water i mean it's not like they're on the on the on the ground where they can just like go to the store and buy some water or something so and we need water to survive so that seems like that's really important "
23372,310.1,Jazmin,,"i see how you came to that conclusion that having water on the moon would be valuable to have for astronauts in space ","i found this somewhere let me see because i thought i underlined it did i did i miss oh yes it's in the beginning okay and i'm in the paragraph four it says watering the most valuable to have ways for example future astronauts could drink this water "
23380,230.1,Farrah,,"why why did you say that ","i'm still kind of confused "
23386,120.2,Farrah,,"yeah i i understand okay so we're looking at the question is there convincing evidence that water on the moon could be valuable ","well i guess the right answer cuz i thought that i had the right answer because i found it in the text you know how you said that we have to look for the evidence in the story did because in the last paragraph it says making this plan will take a lot of time and money they need to study the moon surface and build new equipment do you think you'll be a good investment you decide so i'm like okay a lot of time a lot of money my mom always says like that no no no it takes too much time oh no that's too much money so for me then that means no but then you just told student that when she said yes i was right "
23394,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","yeah yeah so i um well i guess so then there's my answer okay "
23398,430.2,Farrah,,"but i'm concerned that you didn't provide enough evidence and your response so you can see that you don't think it's valuable but i would provide some evidence or some examples as to why why you think ","so can i just write down what i told you "
23405,230.1,Oliver,,"yeah tell me why you why you said that ","okay i wanted to be in that so i just need to come up with a plan for constructing or getting it out of the polar craters making this plan will take a lot of time and money so you don't have a plan i am but you don't even have like the time and the money to make the plan so for me that means that that's not valuable because i don't even have it and i don't know how to get it "
23407,420.3,Oliver,,"You do what the man is doing and look in the text and find some supporting evidence for why you don't think so what you just told me is that they don't have a plan and they don't have time and they don't have enough money. ","ok ok ok "
23411,420.3,Chris,,,"i was just thinking about what student said about the time and i could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
23414,420.3,Chris,,,"it's only that's only a few years away "
23418,120.4,Chris,,"what did you say in your your response ","i said waters heavy so it's good they don't have to carry the ships anymore "
23422,120.4,Chris,,"so what do you think do you think based on what you've heard and read in the text you think finding one on the moon can be valuable ","yeah definitely um yeah because then they wouldn't have to carry it all the way up there in the space shuttle they could just get it on the moon "
23429,120.4,Bennett,,,"oh yeah teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for letting us know what we needed to work on and you gave me some ideas on how i could improve my answer oh yeah me too actually cuz then i realized that i could add some more details to my auntie to your meeting okay bye teacher all right hey "
23431,120.4,All,,,"hello "
23433,120.4,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you "
23435,150.1,Luis,,"oh i'm excited to work with you to my name is teacher and i'm here to discuss the feedback i'm here to give you the feedback that for your responses about the study of water on the moon right so let's begin are you class ready to begin ","um excuse me i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23437,140.1,Luis,,"really so let's begin with you then what do you know about space ","okay well i know a lot about space i know all about the different planets and i know stuff about uhm stars that milky way the sun kind of all the all the big ones "
23439,230.1,Luis,,"so so let's start with your response student you said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks i wonder what made you see that ","um so what i was thinking as after scientists like astronauts on the moon trying to discover the water they can't do anything if they don't have oxygen tanks "
23441,210.4,Luis,,"there was a mention of oxygen in this article again if you class remember reading the article the article mentions hydrogen and oxygen what does that make ","water "
23443,230.3,Chris,,"water yeah that's that makes water so um student said that scientists found creators full of water on moon right is that what you read hi student ","yeah so they thought there wasn't water but it turns out the craters they're full of water "
23445,130.2,Chris,,"full of water would you like to discuss this statement whether your partner to make sure that what you're stating is not incorrect ","oh sure yeah i could do that "
23447,130.2,Chris,,,"oh i'll talk about it with student "
23449,130.2,Farrah,,,"um can i share my answer while they're talking "
23451,120.4,Farrah,,"that's a good idea why don't you do that then ","okay because i said that you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23458,130.2,Jazmin,,"like how you define what it is microscopic would you want to think deeply about that or maybe talk to dave about it in the meanwhile student can answer because chip it seems like dave also so called the same thing as us ","okay i'm ready "
23460,120.4,Chris,,"oh student did you discuss your observation with student do you class have an answer ","yeah okay so uhm student pointed out that it says actually that the ice deposits are really small so even though i was picturing like these big lakes and pools of water it sounds like it's not really like that "
23462,230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah that's that's a good like i really think that was a very fruitful discussion that you had with student so student how did you find out about that what what did you read that make you think that the water is not like giant deposits of water and instead it's something different ","and so i was focusing on paragraph two because that's where i found my answer so it says nasa send a small machine and that was my answer and then at the end of the paragraph it says that the ice deposits are very small "
23465,120.4,Oliver,,"so i think that's can take us back to what's student and student have been looking at student and student have found the answer to this entire question by now would you like to share your answer ","yeah i think we're still a little confused cuz we were thinking how could you discover something if you can't even see it why don't you need the microscope and order to find it because it's so small "
23468,130.2,Luis,,"that's a very good observation would class else in the class like to contribute to this discussion and like to answer what student just said ","okay so i know this because what the lunar orbiter does it's kind of like a robot uhm and it's like it tells the astronaut where the water is so the don't the lunar orbiter it doesn't even need to see it because it's a robot and uh yeah i think that's it "
23470,130.2,Oliver,,"what do you class think that does it sound like a good enough explanation student and student ","um yeah that makes sense but it didn't really say that in the story so i don't think i would have known that if student didn't tell me "
23472,120.3,Chris,,"would you like to read the passage since we feel like the confusion is still there and let's read it together as a class and see what the passage says student yes student ","yeah well actually i have a comment it's that i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23476,120.3,Jazmin,,"so maybe if any one of you can volunteer to read passage 2 and as a class we can try to figure out the answer to this question would like to volunteer for that ","actually i'm really sorry i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i just wanted to say i really appreciate how you asked us to look and explain how we how we found our answers because that really made me think about how how to use the text to explain my thinking and i think that's going to really help me in the future so thank you thank you so much "
23480,150.1,Luis,,"well i've reviewed all of your responses in detail and i noticed some very interesting patterns so the aim of our discussion today is to oliverelop your responses further oh hi yeah student you have a question ","yeah "
23482,150.1,Luis,,,"excuse me teacher ah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23486,110.3,Luis,,"oh you you already know all about space that's really great maybe that's the reason why you should be in this class because then you can help so many your peers learn so much more about space ","oh yeah okay okay "
23490,230.1,Luis,,"so i'd like to start by asking some clarifying questions and said even said that he knows a lot about the space i'd like to start with you student i think you had a very interesting thought but i'd like to understand why you mentioned the use of oxygen tanks in response to this question ","oh yeah sure okay because you know when you go in a space you can't breathe so if you're thinking about equipment oxygen tanks are the most important ones "
23495,230.1,Luis,,"so student um tell me a little bit more about your response what makes you think that the water the creators are full of water ","because in the first paragraph it says scientists phone evidence or water can be found deep within the moon's pool recruiters and i know deep means like a lot of water because when i go swimming in the deep side of the pool it's got like a lot of water "
23500,230.1,Farrah,,"why did you do that ","um well cuz um well i was looking for a name of equipment and i was looking for a section where they're talking about finding water in in in a paragraph three it says the water they found is microscopic meaning you won't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it needed a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that had all of the keywords so i don't understand where my answer is wrong "
23506,120.4,Farrah,,"would like to go and answer them okay so ","um so i i told student but um you hey we need the microscope total closely because there's not a lot of water it's a very little part of it because it says microscopic "
23509,150.1,Chris,,"student so does that clarify the quantity of the water for you ","i guess it can't be like full of water since it's do you have to use a microscope to look at "
23518,120.4,Farrah,,"okay i think i see it would you like to share what you see ","okay it's called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits Oh. well okay if the lunar orbiter looks for ice to pass it and the microscope looks at the water i guess they let the ice melt or something and then they look at it in the microscope "
23521,150.1,Chris,,"so at the end of this entire activity i'd like to know if you feel that you have been able to answer this question in a more in more detail yes student ","it's not that question but i was just thinking about some of the other equipment on the moon and so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23529,150.1,Farrah,,"so do you think all of you have a clear answer now do you think our response has evolved to we can can someone summarize the final answer for me in one clear statement ","oh okay um the use of lunar orbiter to look for ice and then i use the microscope to look at the water "
23532,130.2,Farrah,,"okay um would class like to add to the response further would class like to even further refine savannas response ","oh my mind was going to be different i was just gonna add on to mine that nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to look for ice "
23534,130.2,Oliver,,,"yeah i'm sorry to interrupt teacher but i was looking at the clock and it's actually time for us to goal but thanks for taking time to work with us "
23538,130.2,Luis,,,"um teacher i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23540,110.1,Luis,,"yeah you so you feel you're all good ","yeah yeah can i go "
23544,230.1,Luis,,"that you have mentioned that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen so i want to understand how this is going to be valuable ","okay well oxygen you know we need oxygen to breathe like i told you they can't breathe in space so that's valuable hydrogen i don't know i just saw it in the story and so i figured as important "
23546,220.1,Luis,,"okay so you didn't does that make make you want to stay and listen to the responses of your friends now just to see if you can learn more about how hydrogen can be useful and also to refine your answer further ","okay i guess so "
23549,230.1,Oliver,,"thank you so much for staying um student i read your response and you said no it's not ready yet what makes you say that ","okay cuz then we're talking about you know how how much it's going to cost and how much time it's going to take and how they don't have that time so i'm like well that's not ready "
23553,130.2,Farrah,,"let's see if student has anything different to say ","on okay i mean it's kind of like what student said oh but cuz at the end it says like they need to come up with a plan and it will take a lot of time and a lot of money do you think you will be a good investment so i'm like well no because it'll take a long time "
23557,110.1,Farrah,,"And I really value how Chris has talked about water being really heavy and it cannot be carried on ships anymore Chris, would you like it, yes samana. ","i'm still confused "
23559,230.1,Farrah,,"would you like to share more about your conclusion ","well yeah i mean cuz i thought that i answered the question you know where it said could it be valuable and even at the bottom of the story it asks do you think it would be a good investment and so i said no so i don't i don't understand why that's wrong "
23562,130.2,Bennett,,"okay so i'm i'm going to make a suggestion on how we value investments towards the end of our investigation or discussion today but i would in the in the meanwhile i just want you to listen to why student and student have made some differences to the benefits of this ","okay okay "
23566,230.1,Chris,,"can you tell us why you have made a reference to the water being heavy and it's too heavy for the ships to begin what what's the benefit bike over here that you're trying to ","well that was in the story you talked about how heavy water is and so that they wouldn't have to take them on the on the spaceships anymore so um i mean i guess the benefit is like the spaceship will be lighter "
23571,120.4,Jazmin,,"student why do you go ahead ","we i don't remember what i said oh oh they can drink the water and stay hydrated yeah so you know we can't survive without water so that's why i think it's a benefit "
23582,430.2,Chris,,"to reach a final conclusion about this so i would want to discuss the answer for the impairs and see how you can add the aspect of costs are the aspects of benefit to your question ","so i read there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so they probably are already spending a lot of money to build that and so it would be probably important for them to have water on the moon base yeah that sounds good because then they can read they could drink the water and they wouldn't have to like carry on the water because what if they get more thirsty and they don't have enough water than they could like drink it on the moon okay um i guess oh yeah it "
23586,120.4,Jazmin,,"was i was just asking ","i didn't make a response yet but i guess i can try "
23591,120.4,Jazmin,,,"okay um is there convincing evidence water yes the water could be valuable because astronauts can drink the water and then they don't have to carry it on the ships so this and so it would be valuable to just have it on the moon "
23593,230.1,Jazmin,,"oh the cost part ","and it's expensive but they're already spending a lot of money to do stuff on the moon anyway "
23599,130.2,Oliver,,"based on what evidence you have been able to collect is there class else would like to add to the response that student has made ","as well not to add to it but i was just looking at the clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say thank you for kind of really making me feel valued with my ideas because at first i thought that when you asked her son and student but you were going to say that man student were wrong but then you said that we had some ideas too and so how we could kind of you know put everything together until i give me some ideas on how i can build mice my new answer even though i don't have it yet "
23601,130.2,,,,"student "
23603,130.2,Farrah,,,"oh hello "
23606,140.1,Luis,,"did you class like the reading about the water on the moon what did you think about it ","oh yeah i'm excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space "
23608,140.1,Luis,,"do you what do you what is your most what's your best fact that you have about space that you want to share with all of us ","oh well my favorite um fact about space is that there used to be nine planets but then they kicked pluto out of the planet club because he was too small "
23611,140.1,Luis,,"i know i kind of feel bad for pluto don't you ","yeah me too it pretty much stinks when you're a planet and then you get demoted "
23613,110.3,Luis,,"so maybe student you can kind of help us here then you can maybe be our expert in the class and help the rest of us what do you think about that ","that sounds awesome "
23616,120.4,Chris,,"what did you like the most student ","oh well i thought it was just amazing how the scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
23621,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what do you think ","if there's water on the moon maybe astronauts in the future could drink that water or maybe there could even be life on the moon "
23623,140.1,Jazmin,,"alright do you think maybe one day we could live on the moon ","i don't know it's kind of amazing to think about "
23631,120.4,Farrah,,"student what do you think ","Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment. "
23635,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what do you think ","i was thinking maybe discover "
23638,120.4,Oliver,,"and how about you student what word do you think is real important in that question to give us that clue to find the right answer ","um well i thought equipment also um like student did um but i guess another important word would probably be water "
23641,110.1,Luis,,"good all right ","um maybe scientists. "
23644,120.4,Luis,,"what do you think student ","hmm what equipment ok we had equipment did scientists use to discover water well i guess really the only good word left is moon "
23649,120.2,Farrah,,"alright so does class want to take a guess after looking at those keywords what we're going to use or what was used to discover ","okay so um my answer it was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23653,210.4,Farrah,,"well okay so let's think about a microscope what do we use a microscope to do student you just said it a minute ago but let's repeat it ","to look at really small things "
23658,120.1,Farrah,,"so what might be a better tool to look at the big picture, instead of the little picture that the microscope is going to show us. ","oh um i guess i'm not sure i really thought microscope was the main piece of equipment since i was looking for equipment "
23661,120.4,Chris,,"so student what do you think ","okay well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23664,210.4,Jazmin,,"so what other pieces of equipment did they talk about in the paragraph ","yeah so they talked about a small machine and that was my answer "
23667,210.4,Jazmin,,"a small machine what was the name of the small machine ","oh let me look it says lunar orbiter "
23671,230.1,Luis,,"student why do you think that's the right answer ","um yeah so i totally agree with student here as the space expert in the class and i think it's right because well lunar means moon an orbiter means like it goes around and what you were saying about like the big picture of the whole moon if it's an orbiter it would find the water like on the whole thing and not just on the teeny little pieces under the microscope "
23676,150.1,Farrah,,"student do you understand ","yeah yeah i was gonna say that does make more sense than it did before but also i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping those break this question down into the keywords i'm going to use that next time i have a question like this so thank you "
23679,150.1,Farrah,,,"hello "
23681,120.4,Oliver,,"so student you told me you circled the same answer as student can you remind me which part you and student circled again ","um yeah we both circled the microscope "
23683,110.1,Luis,,"the microscope great ","um excuse me i i have something to say "
23685,110.1,Luis,,,"well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23687,110.1,Luis,,"you know all about space ","yeah sure do "
23689,110.1,Luis,,"yeah i see you have great observations and can we think can we help student and student figure out their answer first ","oh yeah okay "
23692,110.1,Oliver,,"so student and student you find out circled the microscope right ","yeah "
23694,230.1,Oliver,,"can you tell me more about how the microscope helped the scientists ","um yeah okay so um when they found a water well the ice actually was frozen water it was ice when they found is it was so small it was tiny and they couldn't see it without the microscope so they needed the microscope to be able to see it "
23697,210.2,Oliver,,"so our question is what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon which is how they found it at first ","oh i didn't even realize i said that "
23700,210.4,Oliver,,"so let's dive in a little deeper about what exactly do they first use to find it and then they can use the microscope to see it ","oh because the ice is so small "
23703,110.1,Jazmin,,"so student you told me that nasa sent a small machine right ","yes so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
23705,230.1,Jazmin,,"i feel you have a great evidence can you tell me more about this machine ","oh yeah let me look okay in the story it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23707,210.4,Jazmin,,"so the name of this machine is the lunar orbiter ","lunar orbiter "
23711,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah great and what is this machine used for ","well it says to investigate so i guess it maybe looks around because that's what investigate means yeah, I guess so, so it looks around the moon and somehow I don't really know how but somehow it finds those those microscopic ice deposits. "
23714,210.4,Farrah,,"what do you think how does the lunar orbiter help to find the little ice deposits ","i'm not really sure i didn't really get that part about the lunar orbiter i guess i was still thinking about the microscope "
23716,210.4,Chris,,"why don't we look at it all together right now student can you help us read the sentence about the lunar orbiter ","oh yeah i could do that okay so it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
23718,150.1,Farrah,,"great thank you for reading for us um student do you have more a little more idea about lunar orbiter right now ","so i guess it just it looks in the craters is that right "
23722,210.4,Luis,,"student do you know why they call it an orbiter ","yeah i was just gonna jump in because i definitely know this one orbiter means like to go around and so i'm thinking the orbiter goes around the moon "
23724,210.4,Chris,,"yeah and we know that the ice are in the polar craters ","yeah well actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23726,230.3,Luis,,"great and student talked about the oxygen tanks right ","yeah "
23728,210.3,Luis,,"those are all great knowledge or information about scientists and scientists use a lot of different equipments for different purposes right ","yeah like they need the oxygen tanks because they can't go find water on the moon without the oxygen tanks or they couldn't breathe "
23730,210.3,Luis,,"so oxygen tanks help the scientists breathe but what exactly helped the scientists find the water ","um well i guess i said oxygen tanks because i was kind of thinking it would help them find the water because it would help them breathe "
23732,130.1,Luis,,"yeah that's part of it but there's also right now the small machine that we are thinking about right now right ","right yeah the orbiter "
23735,210.3,Luis,,"if we have oxygen but not this small machine the lunar orbiter can we find the ice ","oh no no you can't find it without the orbiter "
23738,110.2,Luis,,"yeah so we need them both ","yeah okay that makes so much sense "
23740,150.1,Luis,,"you got it now student ","yeah i got it now i can see why the orbiter is a better answer yeah than the oxygen tanks "
23743,120.4,Chris,,"and student what did you just tell me about the what equipment did scientists use to discover the water on the moon ","yeah well just listening to what you said to student i see how all the cool stuff at nasa it helps the scientists but it does it do the finding of the water "
23746,110.4,Oliver,,"yeah great conclusion student what do you want to add ","um well so actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i want to say this was such a helpful class you really helped us to understand what the lunar orbiter does and why it's exactly the right piece of equipment you were so clear and it was so helpful thank you "
23749,110.4,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you "
23751,140.1,Luis,,"i'm excited to work with you too i'm also excited that it's friday and i'm excited that we're talking about space exploration which used to be my favorite topic when i was your age yeah student ","um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this room because i already know all about space "
23759,120.1,Luis,,"is there is there any other equipment you know off the top of your head that they use ","oh there's tons of equipment well they have the oxygen tanks and while they have to have a rocket ship if they're going to make it to space they use all sorts of things in that rocket ship they have to have on the gross astronauts astronaut food there's so much stuff that they use "
23765,210.4,Chris,,"i'm curious student do you remember any actual equipment that they use ","oh well i don't know if i'm a brit from the reading but i i went to nasa and so i i also know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23768,230.1,Oliver,,"well let's talk about farrah's and oliver's response of what they circled because they were talking about microscopes student can you explain a little bit more about that for me ","um yeah okay so when they found the water um well actually what i use and it was really really tiny um and so they couldn't see it with just their eyes they had to see with the microscope "
23770,230.1,Farrah,,"mm hmm that's right and student you are you are thinking the same thing right ","yeah so i don't understand why our answer is wrong "
23774,210.4,Farrah,,"to use microscopes they have to take something they already have and put it on the slides and then look into it ","yeah we have them in the science lab oh "
23781,230.1,Jazmin,,"and do you think Jazmin, can you explain a little bit more about what you were thinking. ","yeah so i read in the story that nasa send a small machine and they used it to go in the craters and find the water well the ice "
23790,120.4,Chris,,"Okay, my stopwatch is actually broken, but since you're all looking at me i'm gonna assume you're out then Chris, what did you find when you went back to the text to figure out what this small machine was anf, and how they actually maybe got that water. ","okay so well i looked through the word machine since that's what student was talking about next to that it says lunar orbiter "
23792,210.4,Luis,,"a lunar orbiter what are those that's a that's a really big well phrase it's two words but what what is the lunar orbiter what do we think that might mean student ","um yeah so lunar means moon so you class anytime you see the word lunar it means they're talking about the moon and orbiter as like well an orbit is when something goes around something else so i'm thinking as machine those around them "
23798,210.4,Farrah,,"but that's a little bit of a problem if it's going around the moon and not actually going in the crater how does it find the ice that's in the crater student do you have any thoughts on that ","i don't i don't think it explains it in the story it just said the lunar orbiter looks for the deposits in the crater "
23803,120.3,Oliver,,"i'm wondering let's go back to that question can somebody read the question that we were supposed to answer again student yeah thank you ","um well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to and valuing all of our answers "
23805,120.3,Luis,,,"um excuse me teacher yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
23809,110.3,Oliver,,"do i do i'm sure you do you probably know a lot more about space and idea my son is actually named student as well so i feel like we got that connection already what's um i don't know when i was your age i loved space so i was particularly excited to read this article ","i'm doing good i'm great thanks thanks i i want to say mr teacher thanks teacher "
23813,110.3,Farrah,,,"i'm good to it's pretty good day "
23815,120.3,Chris,,"I know we had a question to start us off that was I don't know Can someone read the question that we were trying to answer before we got in this group. ","yeah it was on one equipment at scientists use to discover water on the moon "
23819,210.2,Chris,,"but before we even look at the article again and start our discussion what do you think are the i don't know maybe two or three keywords in that question things that really got you thinking ","oh i figured it was about like discovering and water on the moon "
23822,110.4,Farrah,,"yeah great so discover's a keyword and waters the keyword ","i think equipments an important word "
23824,110.1,Jazmin,,"i agree and student did you want to add to that well ","that's what i was gonna say too "
23829,120.4,Jazmin,,"so who wants to start us off by how they answered this question ","um okay i'll go cuz I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
23831,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay well sure let's let's um once you give me your answer and we'll talk about it ","okay i said nasa send a small machine and i think that's right "
23833,130.1,Jazmin,,"you know i think you're i think you're right on track is there if you look at the article do you have the article with you ","ya it's on my tablet "
23835,230.2,Jazmin,,"okay good if you look at the article can you point to the spot of the article where it talks about nasa spending excuse me sending not spending sending a small machine ","yeah if the first sentence of the second paragraph where it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23838,210.3,Jazmin,,"perfect so your answer you wrote down your answer nasa send a small machine if you are going to level that up like a video game if you just want to like little extra boost to your answer how might you get a little bit more clarity there ","more clarity um level it i guess i can add more and more words make it a longer answer "
23842,210.3,Jazmin,,"does that machine have a name ","Oh yeah yeah okay I didn't think about that. i could just put the whole sentence down i could say nasa sent a small machine called the orbiter to investigate "
23851,230.3,Farrah,,"well i don't know if i'd call it a machine but you you talked about a scientific tool right ","i think it's a machine because it's like a simple machine that has parts to it that work together so i think so yeah i'll go yeah i thought it was the microscope um cuz that's that was the well yeah i don't know if it's a machine either "
23857,210.3,Oliver,,"what about that discover component, do you think the microscope would help NASA discover the water like actually find it. ","oh yeah i guess not ah i guess not "
23863,210.3,Farrah,,"hmm because thinking about jazmin's answer she's talking about lunar orbiter and i'm wondering if what i'd love to hear your thoughts what's the difference between a lunar orbiter and a microscope in terms of what they do for the scientists ","oh well i don't know student so you can i'm just gonna read it "
23866,210.3,Farrah,,,"um well where jazmin's answer was in the second paragraph there it says the lunar orbiter to investigate land up the moon south pole and look for ice deposits "
23868,230.2,Oliver,,"mm hmm that's true and where's student do you remember where the microscope part was ","yeah that's in paragraph three um it's they use the microscope to look at the water "
23876,130.3,Oliver,,"if if they had it already but in terms of actually finding it the first time i think that might go back to that lunar orbiter idea ","um yeah i i could see that yeah i could see that because maybe they don't they don't have it yet you know i mean i don't know i don't know as much about space as student it done but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
23879,110.1,Chris,,"yeah that's perfect in fact that that brings us over to eton's point in in student your point about science is finding craters full of moon on the water ","yeah "
23888,420.3,Chris,,"do you remember that part of the article i wonder if you can go back to the article and find me a spot where they're talking about that process of finding ","okay how they found it they found evidence that water can be found craters are dark places nasa sent a small machine you know what i don't know case it says that they send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate right lunar orbiter will land at the moon south pole and look for ice deposit so i guess i guess the lunar orbiter is what they use to look for the ice deposits i mean i can't tell if they found it or not though "
23891,130.3,Oliver,,"but the article at least to me wasn't entirely clear which made me think the best answer would be probably the lunar the lunar orbiter because oh hang on just a second student i wanted to talk about luis's note luis's answer on the oxygen tanks totally right ","teacher and i don't mean to interrupt you but it's time for us to go to lunch "
23893,130.3,Oliver,,,"oh well yeah we could finish on when we come back from lunch "
23896,130.3,Jazmin,,,"you're welcome okay see you later teacher can you see us "
23898,130.3,Jazmin,,,"okay let me "
23901,130.3,Jazmin,,,"okay hi "
23903,130.3,Jazmin,,,"it was good we had lasagne and chocolate chip cookies "
23905,130.3,Luis,,,"yeah cuz i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
23909,230.1,Luis,,"okay well well what did you figure out a bit curious to hear ","okay cuz i heard you tell him i'm student and and mmm that we have to hit all the words in the question like equipment and discover and water on the moon "
23911,120.4,Luis,,"and water on the moon okay i'm go back could you go back to your first answer for me um when you answer that question what was the what how did you first answer it ","i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen thing "
23917,310.1,Luis,,"yep that's true so you're right in that they do use a lot of equipment and oxygen tanks were mentioned in the text ","okay so it's not right because um equipment discover water the moon because it doesn't hit the discovery part but i got the equipment and the water on the moon i think "
23919,210.3,Luis,,"yeah i think you're spot on so how might you change your answer the second time if we could scribble that one out and you could write a new answer what do you think you would say that hits that discover part as well ","um jazmin's answer "
23921,120.4,Jazmin,,"oh yeah student what was your answer again ","um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
23925,410.2,Chris,,"because we're gonna make sure our answer touches not only discover water and moon but also equipment and my concern is your answer might not including the equipment component ","what do you want me to tell you "
23928,120.2,Chris,,"oh i was wondering if you can tell me a little bit more about how so scientists found craters full of water in the moon ","oh oh yeah um so when i was looking after we talked about it i think it's jazmin's answer too "
23932,420.2,Jazmin,,"you all have those in front of you right take a look at your original answers and i want you to see if you can check these boxes off equipment discover water and move ","i'm still kind of confused. "
23934,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay what are you confused about student ","well i i thought that i i fixed my answer so now i have everything in it "
23939,120.2,Jazmin,,"i just want to make sure that you see all four components in there as well ","okay okay i got equipment discover oh okay "
23942,120.2,Chris,,,"uh huh "
23946,130.2,Chris,,"student and student can the three of you chat for a minute and share about what you discovered when you looked at your answers and then student and student can you do that as well ","oh i oh i usually talk to student and student if that's okay "
23956,130.2,Farrah,,,"okay so um i had class i had equipment know i had to discovering in the waterpark but i didn't have equipment oh well um i had um just equipment crates i didn't really read the whole the whole thing and in my answer that i did i i realized that i had all of the parts but i didn't mention the water okay oh we have we have the same answer so what did you get um ya i had the same thing equipment and water and i guess it wasn't discovered because we there was found in our but i guess i didn't really have find in our answer so did you change your answer um no not yet oh okay well then i didn't i didn't have anything new online either "
23958,130.2,Farrah,,,"me and student are "
23960,130.2,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah we're done "
23962,120.1,Chris,,"okay just humor me just a minute i want you to take one minute i want you to answer the question again so remember the question is what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon go ahead and write your answer down right your new answer down ","you know i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
23964,110.3,Luis,,"that it's pretty amazing ","that would be pretty cool "
23968,120.2,Jazmin,,"okay go ahead and write your new answers down ","oh okay mine was pretty easy i just had to add one part "
23970,120.2,Chris,,,"i'm not really sure if i did mine right but i'll wait "
23973,120.2,Farrah,,,"ya i'm finished "
23975,120.4,Chris,,"excellent student why don't you start us off how would you answer that question now that we've had a chance to explore it a little bit ","okay well i said um scientists found craters for water on the moon with the lunar orbiter "
23977,110.1,Luis,,"okay that's that's an answer how about you student what did you say ","i just use jazmin's machine that nasa centers small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate the water on the moon "
23979,120.4,Oliver,,"okay student and student sorry you know both both kind of speaking same time student let's doyou first and then student ","okay um so i wasn't sure but i heard student and student saying that jazmin's answer was right so i i said um nasa sent the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
23982,110.1,Farrah,,"okay and how about you student ","oh i said that you need well i kind of cuz i thought that maybe my answer itself was okay so i just scratched out the microscope and put in the lunar orbiter you need a scientific tool called the lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon "
23987,130.1,Oliver,,"I think you're on the right track, ","Okay i'm done. "
23990,130.1,Oliver,,,"uh oh teacher it's time for us to go to our next class "
23993,130.1,Oliver,,,"you too hey i wanted to say that i appreciate how are you i'm you kind of like pointed out like what we needed and then asked us to kind of look back at our enter to figure out what parts we were missing from the question because i think that actually helped me in student cuz i i wasn't sure but then i just kind of matched in my answer the words in the question that we talked about "
23995,130.1,Oliver,,,"yeah okay bye "
23998,130.1,Farrah,,,"oh it's going well we're really excited to work with you "
24001,150.1,Luis,,"awesome it's great to see you class so you class just read that article write about water on the moon ","yeah so um i should be in this class i already know all about space "
24005,110.3,Luis,,"really okay so why don't you help us out what can you tell us a couple of things that you read in that article that you might have already known ","um okay well so i'm in the article okay well i didn't i didn't really finish the article but i still know the answer to the question because i'm scientists they need oxygen tanks so they're going to go into space so that's definitely what they needed to find the water on the one "
24007,120.4,Chris,,"right exactly can class else tell us anything they read in the article ","yes i can "
24009,120.4,Chris,,,"so i read that scientists the found craters full of water on the moon "
24011,140.1,Oliver,,"oh does class know what is water made up of what types of molecules of water made up of class know ","okay yeah i think we learned this i think we learned this in science because we learned that water as an h two o and i know that all is oxygen and the h is hydrogen "
24015,210.4,Jazmin,,"why do we think that it might be important that these astronauts or these people were able to find h2o or water on the moon ","not totally sure but maybe if there's if there's water on the astronauts coudl drink it "
24018,120.4,Farrah,,"i'm moving on her from student what did you read in the article anything new that we haven't talked about just yet ","yeah so um i read that okay the water is microscopic and so for the equipment i said i said you need a microscope to look at it really closely and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24020,210.4,Farrah,,"okay so what did we talk about what micro or microscopic means what does that mean can you explain ","like really really small "
24025,150.1,Jazmin,,"so we thank you we appreciate you for that class else have any other information that they read or anything that they got from the article that they want to share with us ","um yeah so i picked i picked something different from student so i'm wondering because i said nasa send a small machine and i thought that the small machine seemed really important "
24027,230.1,Jazmin,,"what did you find important about the small machine ","oh well if said they used it to what was the word investigate "
24030,140.1,Jazmin,,"um what are some jobs or what are some for some people that usually investigate that we know ","detectives "
24036,210.4,Chris,,"This small machine, so that they can investigate or look around or try to detect things on the moon so that's awesome um anybody else see anything else about this small machine or why they think it may be important. ","well okay um so actually i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and masks and suits Well, the astronauts they need to stay safe and the oxygen tanks and the masks it wouldn't it wouldn't stay alive without those. "
24039,210.4,Jazmin,,,"Can I answer. "
24041,210.4,Jazmin,,,"um well that's that's the thing i'm i'm i'm wondering if it was just a small machine were there even astronauts there because i don't think the astronauts could fit on a small machine "
24044,140.1,Luis,,"yeah that's a really good question so there's so much technology in the world that a lot of times we can go to places without actually physically being there right we've seen cameras and we've seen like ","that would be amazing i really want to do that one day "
24046,140.1,Luis,,"really student some what where else would you explore that's not outer space or maybe actually yeah let's say an outer space what's another planet that you would explore if you had a really small machine that you could use ","oh well okay um i want to look at jupiter because it's so big and it has that red spot that's like a storm as giant giant hurricane and i really want to look at that "
24049,140.1,Farrah,,"oh that's cool student what about you where would you go what planning would you ","well actually i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch now one i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening and getting to know every one of us and our thoughts and our feelings about space it really felt like you cared about who we are and what we think and that was that made this class really fun "
24054,230.1,Luis,,"but when we think about the discover the question right what makes you think about or what what pushes you to say microscope with compared to the word discover what kind of lead you there ","um i have something to say "
24056,230.1,Luis,,,"yeah real quick um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24058,230.1,Luis,,"okay why do you feel that you're not or you shouldn't be in this class because you don't know you already know about space ","yeah um and so i know about my answers right because i already know about space and i don't need your help "
24060,120.4,Luis,,"okay what was your answer ","um my answer was scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24062,230.1,Luis,,"cool how did those oxygen tanks help them to discover that water ","well i know that if there are scientists up on the moon like astronauts they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks while they go around discovering that water "
24064,210.3,Luis,,"right what why do they want to use those oxygen tanks though ","to breathe of course they can't survive on the moon without them "
24068,120.4,Farrah,,"or class else can jump in if you'd like are there any other tools that tou can think about that they might have used outside of their oxygen tanks to help them discover the water yes student ","well yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked me before student interrupted um so well i picked the microscope because they said the water um it's really small and you can't discover something if it's too small to see you need a microscope "
24070,210.4,Farrah,,"okay nice nice so what do we use a microscope for ","um to look at stuff that's really small so i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
24072,210.4,Farrah,,"can you think of another instance or another time or another example of when we use a microscope ","oh yeah well we use them in science class and we put these little slides underneath to look at cells "
24078,150.1,Farrah,,"how do you feel about that ","oh um yeah i guess if an astronaut just had a microscope um it would take them like forever to find the water "
24081,120.4,Chris,,"student um so what did you learn about those craters on the moon ","oh well the scientists the found these craters full of water "
24086,120.2,Chris,,"Right, how can we discover how can we find these craters that are full of this water what what mechanisms or what machines were really used to help us discover this water on the moon. ","um well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like well like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24090,130.2,Jazmin,,"student i think you talked about a small machine do you want to add anything here ","yeah um my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i think that's part of what they use to discover the water "
24093,210.4,Jazmin,,"right um so yeah nasa they definitely sent the small machine um can we think of the name of that small machine ","um i think it's in there um let me look ok um nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24097,120.4,Oliver,,"yeah student ","um well investigate makes me think of like a detective searching for clues "
24100,120.4,Chris,,"student ","yeah i was gonna say find "
24108,120.4,Jazmin,,"student ","ym yeah i can try and put this all together okay so the astronauts went to the moon and of course they had to have all that stuff student and student were talking about oxygen tanks and masks and stuff but to to actually look for the water they used the lunar orbiter and the lunar orbiter helped them find it in the craters and um i think that's class "
24112,110.1,Oliver,,"exactly exactly yeah student go ahead ","um i'm really sorry but um it's time for us to go now "
24115,110.1,Farrah,,,"oh oh we're good we're so excited for your class "
24118,150.1,Luis,,"some responses on your questions and i wanted to work with you class to see if we could delve a little deeper into understanding the concepts yes student ","um yeah excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24122,120.4,Luis,,"and can you go ahead and remind me what did you respond ","oh yeah well i said that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24127,210.3,Luis,,"To see if you could find the answer which we're looking for, which is in regards to what type of equipment they're using to find water Luis do you think that they are using oxygen tanks to help them find water on the moon. ","um well i mean it's not like it's not like they look with oxygen tanks but they need the oxygen tanks to breathe when they're on the mooon "
24130,420.3,Luis,,"would you be able to find in the passage somewhere that actually talks about specific equipment that's been used to help find the water on the moon. ","um yeah okay um I can go back and look. "
24133,120.4,Jazmin,,"student what did you share what did you find as your response to that question ","okay i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24136,420.2,Jazmin,,"but i wonder if we can go a little further i want to see if we can build on your explanation a little bit so a small machine would you be able to know what that machine is called would you happen to know that ","um i think it's in there um nasa sent a machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24140,120.4,Chris,,"student would you be able to share with us which you were able to locate ","yeah oh so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24143,120.3,Chris,,"okay thank you for responding student so i'm wants to go back and i think it was to see if we could try to make an inference so student if you can look at the third paragraph and i want you to just would you be able to read for us the first line of the third paragraph student ","okay that means the moon is still drier than the driest desert on earth okay "
24145,120.3,Chris,,"so student actually read the next sentence too ","okay all the water they found is microscopic meaning wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it okay "
24147,210.3,Chris,,"so here's the looking at these two sentences and thinking back to what you wrote about the water filling the crater and do you think that based upon the clues that this sentence these sentences gave you do you still think that there is a crater full of water what do you think ","well i guess i pictured that at first when they said water on the moon and i was picturing like big pools and lakes but on that part yeah that part says it's so small you can't even see it so i guess i guess what i pictured wasn't quite in "
24151,310.1,Chris,,"i'm so glad that you were using your visualization skills student so make sure you go back and revise some of your thinking that you did there okay ","yeah i also i can really picture it because i went to nasa and i found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24154,110.3,Oliver,,"thank you so much for sharing this sounds like you're a nasa expert will probably come back to you and get some more information whenever we're looking for some of your expertise thank you student ","okay um well i i circled the same as student which was the microscope i think it was a microscope to look really closely about about little water at student was just reading about "
24159,410.2,Oliver,,"i'm concerned you looked at farrah's answer and i don't think that's the case but i want to make sure you're doing your own thinking ","yeah okay well i'm really that was the part that student just read aloud where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely it's like the next sentence right after what student read "
24164,120.3,Farrah,,"i want us to think very carefully about what question with the question is being asked to us what is the question that we're trying to find the answer to student ","oh i'm so sorry i really i really want to keep going but we have to go to lunch now yeah i'm so sorry because this class is so fun and i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really paid attention to every single one of our answers and it was like you could understand why we said that and you could also help us see the right answer so thank you so much for teaching us today "
24171,120.4,Luis,,"and so student go ahead and share it you're about to share ","um yeah well i think i thought that's all figured out now so i'm good "
24173,530.1,Luis,,"ok so student do you want to share your new thinking what has changed in your thinking ","okay well i thought there were astronauts um but now i know there are the astronauts and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now i think those are the answers "
24178,130.2,Jazmin,,"class else were you able to see even from hearing what student shared and even from going back into the passage we can we identify some other words from the actual passage that might give us some clues as to what the ","i found a sentence and and it's the beginning of paragraph two and it's actually the same one i found originally so it didn't change but it's nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and that's what i said before and nasa sent a small machine "
24182,430.2,Jazmin,,"so student is there a way that you can take what you just read and enhance your answer so that it paints a more fuller picture ","well the whole sentence says nasa center small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so i could use the whole sentence "
24186,430.2,Farrah,,,"i'm still kind of confused "
24189,230.1,Farrah,,"okay student can you help me what is your confusion is it the question ","yeah about the response because it sounds like you said jazmin's answer is the right answer but i don't understand why "
24193,230.1,Farrah,,,"can describe it to us "
24198,110.1,Jazmin,,"is called know the lunar rover i think ","yeah that's what it says in the story "
24202,210.4,Jazmin,,"is that the robot that searched on the planet can you read that whole section again for me ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter will land at the south pole and look for ice deposit in a large polar crater "
24205,210.4,Luis,,,"the mars rover was so cool "
24210,130.3,Farrah,,"the lunar orbiter was the equipment that did the discovery can you see that now and the response ","um okay so yeah it said that the orbiter looks for the deposits but the microscope you need to look at the deposits "
24212,210.3,Farrah,,"absolutely student i guess i want to ask you did the scientists take my microscope up into space ","as well he then said there's no astronauts so no "
24219,210.3,Chris,,"or is a more of once the water is found then we can say oh it's a microscopic amount what would you say ","yeah yeah that's beginning to that makes more sense now because they can't use the microscope if there's no astronauts to look through it yeah I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
24222,420.2,Chris,,"okay thank you for sharing that student now i would love for you to share with me is there any way that you want to change your answer anything else you want to add to your response to make it more compelling ","okay well um so we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so i should probably put equipment in my answer "
24226,420.2,Oliver,,"I think it's a good idea to use some of the language of the question in your response and then definitely the zone in on piece of equipment found in the in your answer. ","yeah okay um so originally i was thinking um you put it find something if you don't see it so you need a microscope cuz you can't find something you can't see but now i'm thinking that the lunar orbiter can find it and then the scientists look at it through the microscope like later "
24230,310.1,Oliver,,"i think that the progression by which you identify those events was very clear and it may painted such a clear picture for others so thank you for restating that ","now all we have to go to lunch after lunch time but i want to say thank you for taking the time to really listen to each one of us and why we were confused and help each one of us figure out how to move forward with a better answer it really felt like you cared about everybody's thinking thank you so much "
24234,120.3,Luis,,"in in writing those responses so what i want class to do is i want you to read the question one more time okay we oh student you have a question go ahead ","um yeah well i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24237,120.3,Luis,,"but can you actually read the question out loud for me can you read the question ","yeah um okay what he did scientists use to discover water on the moon. "
24239,150.1,Luis,,"great and there's a second part to that question that says circle do you see that part ","um oh okay yeah there are this circle the evidence and the text where oh that we can use to answer this question "
24243,310.1,Luis,,"awesome so i saw in your answer student that you did a great job identifying evidence identifying equipment that scientists use to reach the moon ","i'm not really um but i guess i'd caught up circle the word scientists because if there are scientists on the moon they have oxygen tanks "
24245,430.3,Luis,,"But that's keeping you from seeing what's really in the text too, so can you look through one more time and see if you can circle any words that that are words for equipment in the text. ","okay yeah i can do that "
24251,420.3,Jazmin,,"Can you look back in the text and see if you can find some specific vocabulary for me. ","oh ok ok nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24254,210.4,Jazmin,,"awesome what did you find in that sentence ","lunar orbiter and investigate "
24257,210.4,Jazmin,,"so what is a lunar orbiter ","oh well i guess it's a machine "
24259,210.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so do you think adding lunar orbiter to your answer could make your answer even stronger ","yeah i guess so "
24264,230.1,Jazmin,,"tell me why ","well i i picked a machine because it sounded like the word equipment but maybe if i say lunar orbiter and it's a better answer because it's the name of the machine "
24267,230.3,Farrah,,"i love that exactly right if we just a machine that it's kinda like the question it's just saying equipment right but if we bring that name in it tells us specifically great job student really good work ","yeah well i was kind of hoping i could go next because now that student went i'm kind of confused i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24269,150.1,Oliver,,"yeah great question and student i really want you to pay close attention to what's student and i are talking about and i'd like you to jump into because you had the same answer as student okay ","okay "
24272,120.3,Oliver,,"which one of you would like to read the question again out loud for me ","i can do it um okay equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon circle the evidence in the text that we can use to answer the question "
24274,210.2,Oliver,,"alright so what is it really asking for what information does it want to know ","um equipment "
24276,130.2,Farrah,,"equipment and what else student can you help out what kind of equipment does it want to know about ","okay equipment for discovering water "
24278,110.1,Farrah,,"yes equipment for discovering water there's one more piece to that ","um "
24280,130.2,Chris,,"student do you want to jump in how about student and student what's it asking for it's asking for equipment for discovering water what else is it asking for ","oh oh circle evidence in the text "
24284,210.2,Chris,,"that's true what kind of equipment or what kind of equipment that scientists use to discover water are we looking for are we looking for equipment that we can use or equipment that we did use ","oh did did did scientists use "
24287,110.1,Farrah,,"great john student awesome teamwork class so let's go back to the text student and student you circled the part about the microscope ","yeah okay you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24289,210.4,Farrah,,"great so what was that part of the text telling us ","that you can't see the water without a microscope "
24291,210.3,Farrah,,"yes you can't see the water out of microscope exactly right does it say that scientists did use that equipment to discover it on the moon ","i guess i thought that's what it meant but now that you mentioned it it doesn't exactly say that "
24294,310.1,Chris,,"i love that critical thinking student i love looking back at your answer like that awesome so let's as a class go back to the text and i'd like you to yes student ","well i just wanted to share i went to nasa so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
24296,120.3,Chris,,"But what was that second part of the question, can you read the second part of the question, Chris ","circle the evidence in the text we can use to answer this question "
24299,210.3,Chris,,"yeah so are looking to bring in our answer from outside information for when you went to visit nasa or are we looking somewhere else for our answer ","oh so it needs to be from the story "
24302,420.3,Farrah,,"so i'm going to go back and check in with student about what he's working on will the three of you look through this text and see if you can find one more piece of equipment that the text talks about ","okay "
24306,120.4,Luis,,"awesome thank you hey student how's your search going ","i'm i'm okay at work really well but um i just i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch right now I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space. "
24313,230.2,Farrah,,"where in the text they figured out how to answer this question about equipment ","okay so i figured it out from paragraph three "
24315,230.2,Farrah,,"okay and do you have a specific sentence ","yes so i circled the part where it says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24317,110.1,Chris,,"all right thank you so much for sharing that student did i see you raise your hand student ","yeah i found my answer in the first paragraph "
24319,230.2,Chris,,"okay and were you looking at a specific sentence ","mm hmm yeah so where it says on scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar readers "
24322,150.1,Jazmin,,"all right thank you so much so what i wanted i want us to do today is to take a step back from the text and take a really close look at the question that we're answering ","i can read it "
24324,150.1,Jazmin,,,"what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24327,210.2,Oliver,,"what is this question looking for is it looking for a person is it looking for a place what kind of answer do we need to give to answer this question dev ","it needs to be a thing "
24329,230.1,Oliver,,"it does need to be a thing and what made you say that ","the questions asks what equipment i'm i'm so um you know your need to find an equipment to answer that question "
24333,210.2,Farrah,,"now we're going to ask ourselves is there anything else in this question that helps us know what we should be looking for so dev has identified that we are looking for a piece of equipment does this question say anything else about what we should be looking for ","on it it also says the equipment to discover water "
24336,110.4,Jazmin,,"okay equipment to discover water and student ","and yes i was going to say the same thing is also that i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24339,210.2,Jazmin,,"But, as you and Farrah also pointed out, is that this question is asked me for a piece of equipment and then also a piece of equipment that discovered water on the moon, and so one thing that I am missing from your answer is. ","Ok so I have to say NASA sent a small machine to discover water on the moon. "
24345,210.2,Chris,,,"so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24348,210.2,Chris,,,"okay one to discover the water specifically "
24350,120.2,Farrah,,"yes all right i'm going to give you all 10 more seconds to read over and then let's come back and discuss if we think we've found a sentence that has a piece of equipment that talks about being used to discover water student ","on well i would still say the same sentence i said before you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look directly at it "
24355,210.2,Farrah,,"and i want to remind us that we are trying to find an answer that talks about discovering water ","oh i can see how they might be a little different "
24357,210.2,Oliver,,,"look it's time for us to go right now but thank you so much for teaching us today "
24360,230.3,Luis,,"alright class i think that we had just discovered a really valuable piece of information about savannas answer we had determined that microscopes help us look at things which is not quite the same as discovering or looking for something student can you help me oh ","yeah well i think i got this all figured out so i'm "
24363,230.2,Luis,,"great can you show me the sentence that you found in the text that we were looking for that made you feel so confident ","as well okay i gotta say it's not from the text but you'll have to discover and oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the loan they are using oxygen tanks when they discover the water "
24367,120.4,Jazmin,,"student ","okay nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24370,230.1,Jazmin,,"and what made you pick this particular sentence student ","well it's the same sentence i picked before but i picked it because it has the word machine which is equipment and investigate which kind of reminds me of discover a little bit "
24375,120.4,Oliver,,"Oliver. ","and i got this it has an equipment because it sounds small machine and that has a word like discover "
24378,230.3,Farrah,,"great yes so we have found a sentence that answers both parts of our question right it gives us a piece of equipment the scientists are using and it's telling us that this equipment is used to discover things it's used to investigate to look for something student ","okay i'm still kind of confused "
24381,230.1,Farrah,,"can you tell me why you're confused ","i understand the lunar orbiter on because it's a machine to investigate that makes sense but i still think there's evidence in the text on that it could also be the microscope because that sentence has any equipment and it has a word like look for which is like discover "
24385,210.2,Farrah,,"The one thing that I want to point out here is that our question is asking for something that helped discover water, which means that before they use the equipment they didn't have the water. ","Oh well, yeah in science class, we have to put the slide under the microscope and then we look at it. "
24388,210.3,Farrah,,"So do we think that the microscope has discovered the water? ","oh oh no you can't put it under the microscope if you haven't discovered it "
24395,310.1,Chris,,"but i think we all did a great job really breaking down with this question with asking us for and finding a great sentence that helps us answer this question ","mean it's it's a comment related to the story i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
24401,120.4,Luis,,"and i want us to move on to the second question and before we do that can somebody tell me a strategy that we can use well answering the second question ","okay i'm gonna go with actually reading the story "
24404,230.3,Jazmin,,"this is a great start we need to read the text right because we're looking for a sentence student ","and okay so a strategy for this new question i would say is to really look at the words in the question and find the words that tell you what the user needs to be "
24410,420.1,Oliver,,"of the strategy that we just did with question one and pick out the words in the question that tell us what we should be looking for ","and i'm so sorry and i just looked up a clock and we we have to go to lunch right now but i want to test say thank you for teaching us this new strategy because using the words in the question like really understanding what discover matt and i'm looking for a sentence with what like similar words i really do think that's going to help us answer question to why don't we get to it after lunch "
24414,150.1,Luis,,"i'm your teacher and i'm excited to talk to you today meet for a little bit to discuss what we all just read from water on the moon which is pretty exciting hi yes student you have a question ","yeah um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24421,210.4,Chris,,"what if you told me a story about how how they how the scientists at nasa figured out that there is water on the moon which is super exciting what would you tell me if you just were like explaining it to your friend or to a sibling or to your parents based on what you read what happened to lead them to that discovery ","okay oh it's it's so cool okay so we used to think nasa used to think that the moon was totally dry and like a desert but actually the scientists they found these craters full of water on the moon "
24426,230.3,Farrah,,"student you mentioned a microscope right ","oh yes yes that was my answer i said i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24434,120.4,Jazmin,,"did class get it does class know what they sent up in space to figure it out to analyze all this student ","yes and i said nasa sent a small machine "
24437,140.1,Jazmin,,"and hydrogen is part of h2o you heard people talk about h2o ","yes yes we have "
24444,140.1,Luis,,"so maybe in your site yes water is a big part of who you are okay ","yeah it's like it's like you know after an explosion and it goes oh there's that big that big that big lined up big thing of smoke that goes up into the air that's like a plume "
24448,210.4,Chris,,"right so they they hypothesized but if we send this we send a rocket and create a plume then we can send our we can send ","well so i went to nasa and i know that the scientists they they have to use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like student said and and masks and suits "
24455,120.2,Chris,,"When we are talking about what what equipment they specifically used right to to discover water on them on the moon, so, if you look at the text that you have. ","so cool "
24462,210.4,Oliver,,"and you can you can you see the text right now student do you look at the can class see the tax that i'm talking about ","yeah yeah we have it here on our tablets but i just wanted to say i looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say the way that you told us that story about how they use the equipment and space that really helped me understand the answer that it was the lunar orbiter and that they didn't just send a little microscope up to that great big moon and and the story really helped me understand that so thank you so much "
24469,120.2,Luis,,"each of you individually which was the the equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon and is student pointed out oh sorry about student yes ","okay yeah i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
24472,230.3,Jazmin,,"so um student was saying that she thought she had the right answer and you were saying yes she did not the right answer but she needs to be more specific so i just looked at her sentence ","so the name of it's the lunar orbiter then "
24481,110.1,Luis,,"that's great so that was good that as as a class ","to answer from something you read well this time i just started with jazmin's answer and then i used to find the right answer "
24485,120.3,Jazmin,,"right so can we can one of you read the question out loud for me i'll read the question that's great ","what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24489,420.1,Farrah,,"like a treasure hunt right so what if you could take a second and circle the words in the question that you'd be looking for ","oh yeah i'm still kind of confused "
24494,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah ","did that like i use that strategy of looking at the words in the question i looked at equipment and discover in water and in the paragraph where student said it i don't see discover or water "
24497,130.3,Farrah,,"to investigate right ","yeah i saw that one "
24507,120.4,Farrah,,"i'm trying to think what you said about make connections on right ","is it like on like inference our teacher does say talk about inferences "
24512,420.3,Chris,,"so let's see if you can look in that first paragraph to find this phrase that would help you make that connection between what the lunar orbiter is investigating from the previous paragraph ","and teacher i've heard that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024 "
24515,110.3,Chris,,"that's pretty soon from now exactly ","it's only a few years from now "
24518,210.1,Chris,,"so if we're going to have a moon base right that's why we're trying to figure out what they sent right so that they could discover this water student and you find something yeah okay ","so in the first paragraph you're talking about how there was there there was water on the moon and now they think that there is water "
24520,210.4,Chris,,"right so that it kind of establishes that what they're trying to investigate and find right is the water ","okay yeah yeah yeah i understand that "
24525,520.1,Chris,,"how what did you learn right what did you take away from this process of making inferences and making connections what did you learn about that you might be able to apply the next time you encounter a question like this ","yeah there were two things that you you told us to do one was to go back to the question and look for the words in the question "
24529,120.1,Chris,,"right and ","and find those words in the answer and then um um but then student was like but i didn't see the words so then you said we should go to the paragraph before and try to read that paragraph to try to understand the next one "
24534,150.1,Oliver,,"does that make sense student yeah yeah ","yeah i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch i wanted to say thank you for explaining what what we need to work on because you you when you're talking to student and student on tv i gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to so thank you "
24536,150.1,Oliver,,,"bye "
24539,150.1,Luis,,"good morning class i guess it's afternoon now so you've all just shared your answers with me and they were awesome answers i think we can do a little bit better so we're going to push our thinking today yeah student i see you raise your hand what can i help you with student ","um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24542,220.1,Luis,,"but this is not about background knowledge or even knowing about space what we're working on today is we're practicing using text to support our answers so our class is going to learn how to use text as evidence so that's why we're here today student ","oh okay that makes sense "
24544,510.1,Farrah,,"yeah so this is a really important skill for scientists we need to be able to look at a text and use quotes or information from the text to support our answers ","oh "
24546,150.1,Farrah,,"look everybody's ready ","i can go "
24548,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah student let's start with you thank you for volunteering ","yeah so i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24550,230.2,Farrah,,"what paragraph from the text did you get your answer from ","um i found it in part three "
24552,230.1,Farrah,,"that's awesome student can you tell me what the scientists were looking at with the microscope ","and yeah so they were looking at the ice deposits the really small pieces of ice "
24556,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah student why don't you go ahead and share your answer ","okay so i said my answer was nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24559,110.2,Jazmin,,"so your answer is not wrong student ","i found it in part two "
24561,210.4,Jazmin,,"awesome so student can you tell me what the small machine was called ","oh yeah okay it says this isn't a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
24563,210.4,Jazmin,,"awesome so this small machine was called the lunar orbiter student what did nasa do with that machine ","they used it to investigate "
24565,210.4,Chris,,"yeah does class know what investigate means ","oh yeah i do "
24567,120.4,Chris,,"yeah student go ahead and share with us ","so investigate is when you sort of look around for something in particular are sort of like a detective might investigate a certain place for like clues and stuff "
24570,130.2,Chris,,"all right does class else have any other ideas about tools that nasa might have used ","yeah i do "
24572,130.2,Chris,,,"okay so well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks like student said but also masks and suits "
24576,230.2,Chris,,"yeah that's awesome so is that information in our text anywhere student ","um no not really but i saw them all when i went to nasa so i know they use them We have to pick the equipment from the story. "
24579,120.4,Oliver,,"student i haven't heard from you yet do you think we've found all of the equipment that they used in this text ","yeah well i think we did but i'm still a little confused about why it's my not the microscope like why that isn't exactly the right answer because i was sort of thinking how can you discover something if you can't even see it yeah i mean i guess i guess they use that small machine but i still think that microscope is the right answer "
24583,110.2,Oliver,,"yeah so student you're exactly right there's more than one right answer here so savannas answer about the microscope was correct and jazmin's answer about the lunar orbiter was correct ","oh ok so we could say either one That's party cool. "
24586,120.3,Luis,,"does someone want to read paragraph one out loud for us ","yeah i do "
24588,120.3,Luis,,"yeah thanks student go ahead and read paragraph one for us ","okay it says scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moons polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines "
24590,210.4,Farrah,,"thank you student so student i haven't heard your voice in a while student does paragraph one talk about any tools or equipment that the scientists used ","oh no no "
24594,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah exactly right so only in paragraph two or three is any equipment mentioned ","yeah i'm really sorry but i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us make sure that our answers were based on evidence from the text and finding evidence from each different paragraph that i think is going to be really helpful next time we have to do a question like this so thank you so much "
24596,210.4,Bennett,,,"welcome back how did that feel "
24598,210.4,Farrah,,,"hi hello "
24601,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me i should have been and this class i already know all about space "
24603,110.3,Luis,,"well i'm glad you know a lot about space and it would be really nice if you could contribute some of that expertise to our class conversation ","yeah okay i can do that "
24606,150.1,Farrah,,"awesome sounds good okay so before we begin does class have any questions about why their answer may not have been exactly correct ","well i'm not sure why my answer is wrong because well i found the piece of equipment that they used to discover the water "
24612,120.4,Oliver,,"okay who wants to share what word they circled in the prompt ","so i picked equipment "
24615,110.1,Jazmin,,"student what did you pick ","i chose discover "
24622,110.1,Jazmin,,"discover that's also a good word ","why my answer is wrong because i said nasa sent a small machine and i think that's the machine to discover so why is my answer wrong i don't understand "
24625,150.1,Jazmin,,"does that make sense ","oh the small machine "
24630,430.2,Jazmin,,"so my suggestions are that you go back in the text and you identify that specific piece of a quick ","i can go look for the name "
24637,120.2,Luis,,"so yes let's all read and see if we can come up with that specific piece of equipment ","um okay so i said at first i said oxygen tanks on but now i also want to add on the lunar orbiter which is the thing that student was talking about so i think my answer is scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and the lunar orbiter "
24640,110.1,Farrah,,"okay does class else have a response thank you student ","well i know you said that we had to look for the name of the machine so i'm guessing that that's the lunar orbiter but i still don't understand why it's not the microscope "
24642,230.1,Farrah,,"okay um so could you explain a little bit more about why you're choosing the microscope over the lunar orbiter ","yeah so it says the water they found is microscopic and so you can't see something that's microscopic unless you have a microscope so you can't discover it if you can't see it "
24648,150.1,Farrah,,"does that make sense ","well i guess if that's what the lunar orbiter does but i didn't know that that's what it does "
24652,110.1,Chris,,"so let's hear from one other person and then we can talk more about your concern is that okay ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24654,120.4,Chris,,"yes well i'm glad you're able to connect that personal experience what did you end up revising your response to the initial prompt though ","oh oh okay well at first i didn't say any equipment what it sounds like that's really important because it's a it's a keyword like you said so now i said on my answer is the small machine called a lunar orbiter "
24663,210.3,Oliver,,"after you thought and you have a good solid thought let's share what does that mean ","oh well really like to share but it's actually time for us to go now "
24666,150.1,Luis,,"alright class so it seems like we all have sort of different answers to this question right now so i want us to take a step back and look back at the text and the question to see if we can all come to an understanding yes student ","i'm excuse me i shut me in this class i already know all about space "
24675,120.4,Farrah,,"okay savana what what where did you write down ","okay so i thought a word that meant the same thing as equipment with the tool "
24677,230.3,Farrah,,"tool that's a good one yeah so tool a tool can mean the same thing as equipment for sure nice job student and student i saw your hand went up what's a word that you thought might be the same thing as equipment ","okay well it's not one word but equipment is like a thing that you use to complete a job "
24681,120.4,Jazmin,,"class else let's have one more person share what's another word for equipment ","oh well this word is actually from the story and it's machine and that was part of my answer nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer was wrong "
24689,120.4,Oliver,,"why don't we get three words that you all wrote down that have to do with discover so to someone want to volunteer word that they wrote down that has the same thing as discover student why don't we hear from you first ","what did you discover for that i said find "
24691,230.3,Luis,,"find that's a really good one right if you're discovering something you're finding it nice thanks and then student i saw your hand go up what did you come up with student ","um yeah well i also thought find but i think what's really important is you're finding it for the first time no one else found it before "
24695,230.3,Chris,,"yeah that's a very good point it's for the first time so you're finding it for the first time good thanks student in depth those are really good words to point up ","oh well i don't know if this one is really good but when you discover something it's like you uncover it like it was hidden and then you uncover it "
24697,230.3,Chris,,"yeah that could be interesting it's hidden maybe you can't find it you're not able to see it or you don't know if it's there and you uncover it that's very good yes ","yeah can i share one more thing "
24699,230.3,Chris,,,"yeah so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24705,420.3,Oliver,,"Okay, so I want you all right now to go back to the text and just underline any tools or machines any equipment that you see in either of those three paragraphs okay Oliver do you have a question. ","um yeah well that's not a question on i just looked up a clock around we actually have to go to lunch right now i'm so sorry because i really want to do the next part of this activity and i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us understand the question so well i think i might do that same thing next time what writing down similar words that was really helpful thank you "
24708,150.1,Luis,,"alright class so it's so interesting to hear all of your responses because it sounds like i'm hearing a few different things you know the more class seems to have a different response yeah student have a question ","yeah well i'm i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24710,120.4,Luis,,"really what did what was your response to this question can you just remind me ","yeah um well i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
24712,230.1,Luis,,"and how do we oxygen take specifically help us find water on the moon ","yeah well so if there's astronauts there's no way they can find the water on the moon if they don't have oxygen tanks to breathe "
24716,110.2,Farrah,,"that's really great point ","okay well i said actually that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
24718,230.2,Farrah,,"oh awesome and then what paragraph did you find that piece of evidence and ","okay i found it in part three "
24721,230.2,Farrah,,"can you read that sentence do you have it circle in your app ","yeah ok so the part i circled is okay the water you they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it you need a scientific tool called a microscope "
24725,110.1,Chris,,"how about let's hear from somebody else class else want to share out there and to our class ","okay well so i said that scientists the phone creators full of water on the moon "
24727,230.3,Chris,,"like full of like water that we're drinking so like the water in my water bottle ","yeah well that's sort of how i pictured it yeah cuz creators they're so big and it's like i was picturing sort of like lakes and pools of water "
24730,230.2,Chris,,"oh that'd be really cool to find where did you find that in the text ","on okay so in part it's right at the beginning so it says scientists have found evidence that can be found deep within the moon's creator "
24733,110.1,Jazmin,,"oh yeah that's really interesting student do you want to quickly share what you have said ","yes so i said that nasa centers small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24735,210.4,Jazmin,,"um let's unpack that a bit so what is the small machine do ","investigate "
24737,210.4,Jazmin,,"what is it investigating for what are we looking for and ","the water well actually ice ice deposits in the craters "
24739,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah that's a really great detail you found so student based off of that evidence are we swimming and large bodies of water what are we looking for ","whoa whoa okay it sounds like it's not really how i pictured it may be "
24742,210.4,Jazmin,,"it might not be like full bodies of water but we have ice right and what does ice made out of ","water "
24744,210.4,Jazmin,,"exactly so that's the kind of water we're looking for ","that make sense "
24747,210.4,Jazmin,,"oh that's interesting so we have equipment both in part two and part three so what does that mean how many pieces of equipment are we looking at ","oh i think there's two pieces of equipment "
24751,130.1,Jazmin,,"let's think about how we could you know circle both the civic equipment and not only that but also think about what each piece of equipment is doing for us ","um yeah well i'm still not totally sure because i know me and student we were thinking about the microscope because if the ice is so small how are you going to find it if you can't even see ya so that's why we thought it would be just on my periscope because you need to see it and the first place "
24755,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah that's a really good point so we know that we're using the microscope once we know that there's water right but in order to find the location with the water what are we using ","oh so maybe the machine does "
24758,210.4,Chris,,"exactly so we start with the machine let's go ahead and look for that ice and then we're like oh look this looks like this weird substance kind of looks like something we find and then what ","oh well okay so it sounds like they use that machine and that finds where is the ice and then they look at it with a microscope and also i went to nasa actually so i know that scientists they they use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24763,210.4,Luis,,"space and all that what do we need for oxygen takes ","well the oxygen tanks that's why we use them "
24765,210.4,Luis,,"yet so we use the oxygen tanks and then what is water made out of made up of ","oh i know that's one s h two o "
24767,210.4,Luis,,"and what does the a stamp or what is the o stands for ","hydrogen and oxygen "
24770,210.4,Luis,,"great so we will eventually use the water deposits and hopefully make that into the oxygen tank so that we can go to the moon and stay there ","um i was sorry i i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i just wanted to say i really appreciated how you found a way that each of our answers could fit together but also helped us understand what each piece of equipment dead that was really helpful and learning from each other you made that so easy thank you so much "
24775,150.1,Luis,,"alright so i'm noticing a lot of different responses and i want us to make sure that we have just a general understanding of the text so class has really good specific details and different questions yeah even ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24778,140.1,Luis,,"know do you just like to read about this on your own ","well i watch youtube and i watched nova sometime so yeah you know about equipment that scientists use of space "
24781,150.1,Luis,,"but i want us to look back at this question and we're going to debrief as a whole class and then i want you to think about how the advice that i'm giving the whole class applies to your question does that sound good ","okay "
24792,120.4,Farrah,,"let's debrief do you think that your response has both of those parts ","okay mine has the equipment but not the second part the second part but not the first part i have both of the parts so i don't understand why my interest wrong "
24799,120.4,Luis,,"how about you student ","i'm okay i guess i have that first part two because i got equipment but i don't have anything about the water in the mon "
24801,210.4,Luis,,"alright so you have the word equipment but let's take it one step further what specific piece of equipment is being used ","the oxygen tanks "
24803,210.4,Luis,,"all right what is the oxygen tank being used for ","to breathe "
24805,210.3,Luis,,"right and is that what we're looking for is a ","lot of equipment that scientists used to just go over water um i guess not because now i guess "
24808,310.1,Luis,,"right so glad that you were able to pick that up and go back to the question and read it and notice that mismatch between your answer in the question ","okay "
24813,310.1,Farrah,,,"okay um so i think that the the my the microscope doesn't discover the water but i don't see discover in the in the story "
24828,310.1,Farrah,,"i like that you're looking for that keyword right ","oh oh teacher you're frozen can you see me and hear me teacher oh i'm class are we frozen or is a teacher frozen on i think the teachers frozen yeah i think the teachers frozen yeah i don't know if she can hear us maybe somebody should try to write in the chat box okay i'm gonna write in the chat box oh nevermind to vanish student she's gone okay yeah oh she's back okay um i don't remember what i was saying no oh "
24830,210.2,Farrah,,"so what is another word that means the same thing as discover ","oh um find "
24832,420.3,Chris,,"think about that general idea and see if you could go back into the text and find something that's similar so words that are like discover but not necessarily discover ","so i found the equipment because student told me what it was but i was thinking you know i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
24837,210.2,Jazmin,,"but once again thinking back to the question itself what do we want the specific equipment to do ","okay um so then so i just have to add the water on the moon part for mine case i have the equipment so i can say nasa send to small machine to discover water on the moon "
24842,210.3,Jazmin,,"beyond right so just by what do you think would make your response one bit higher so you tell me the equipment ","and i told you i said what was discovered and i said the were on the moon "
24844,230.1,Jazmin,,"what was your what ","and i said the who "
24846,210.4,Jazmin,,"the small machine what is this machine ","lunar orbiter "
24848,110.1,Jazmin,,"there you go ","ok "
24851,110.1,Oliver,,,"excuse me teacher yeah i was just looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so um thanks for taking time to work with us "
24855,230.1,Luis,,"alright class thanks for sharing your responses with the class i'm noticing some things right i'm noticing that we each sort of have different answers and i have a question to you why do you think we each have different answers ","class we are all different people with different ideas i mean i shouldn't even be in this class i already know all about space "
24859,110.3,Luis,,"you know all about space so cool ","wow i mean i i watch a youtube video was a lot about the space and i'm and i follow you on musk on twitter "
24867,120.4,Jazmin,,"All right, what do you think was the most important question or the most important word that the question was asking you. ","i said equipment i said equipment to "
24871,120.4,Chris,,"student what did you say ","i said discover water "
24877,150.1,Farrah,,"so now that we know exactly what we want to find yes ma'am ","yeah excuse me i have all those so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
24881,210.3,Farrah,,"what i want you to look for right so you pulled out the word of discover does your piece of equipment discover water or does it do something else is it just one equipment to find it are we using it to discover it think about that ","it looks really closely looks really closely "
24884,420.2,Chris,,"and then for the rest of us look back at your response and then see if you have those three things did you name a piece of equipment and does that piece of equipment discover the water on the moon so take 30 seconds back in your work and see if that does that ","okay so yeah i didn't have equipment in mind but i do know cuz i went to nasa that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in masks and suits "
24887,110.3,Chris,,"alright so they definitely use a lot of equipment and it's so cool that you've gone to nasa that's amazing ","and to discover the water "
24889,210.3,Chris,,"exactly so in your response did you name an equipment that discovers water ","no i forgot to put that part in "
24891,120.3,Chris,,"all right go ahead and look backward in the text what about the rest of us ","i forgot to put the discovering water part but i did put the equipment in my answer "
24894,420.2,Jazmin,,"hi student with your response it did say that you include a piece of equipment but i think it could be more specific right i think you could go back to the text and tell me the specific name of the piece of equipment that you're talking about ","okay oh it's the lunar orbiter "
24896,420.2,Jazmin,,"exactly so always more into adding those key details but make sure that you update that information and then add the part that you said you were missing ","so i can just add in call it a lunar orbiter to discover water on the moon and then this is a good answer is it right "
24901,420.2,Jazmin,,"yep and then of course because we're amazing students you want to make sure that the last thing we do is always explain our why and in this case i'm asking you to highlight where you find that in the text so just make sure that you're highlighting that ","like in paragraph two i just have to add that right I found it in paragraph two. "
24905,110.1,Oliver,,"awesome ok ok ","i'm teacher i looked at the clock out it's time for us to go to lunch um but i do want to say thank you for explaining what strategies we can use to try and and have more full answers because i was listening and now i kind of know that we can add more evidence from the text in our answer and thanks for taking the time that i'm explaining that strategy bye bye "
24907,110.1,Farrah,,,"hi teacher nice to see you "
24909,110.1,Chris,,,"morning "
24912,110.1,Jazmin,,,"hello good morning "
24914,110.1,Luis,,,"um so um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24917,110.3,Luis,,"that's great you must read a lot about space you must learn a lot about it ","that sounds great yeah let's do it "
24920,230.1,Luis,,"okay so it sounds like where did you learn that fact ","oh well anytime that there are scientists out in space they need to have oxygen tanks that's just like basic space stuff "
24922,230.1,Luis,,"oh and why do they need the oxygen tank ","oh well typically you can't breathe in space without an oxygen tank "
24925,120.3,Luis,,"i'm wondering could you read the question that we wanted to answer out loud for class ","um yeah okay so it asked what equipment did scients use to discover water on the moon "
24930,120.3,Luis,,"and the next part of the question ","um it says okay circle circle the evidence and the text that we can use to answer this question i'm. in that text "
24933,210.3,Luis,,"and the text right was the oxygen tank information in the text or was that from from all your knowledge you already have ","oh i guess it doesn't say oxygen tanks but it says scientists so if they're scientists there's oxygen tanks "
24936,150.1,Luis,,"so okay i'm wondering if we can maybe move to another student and let's try to see some of their answers and how we can get closer to the answer in the text sound good student ","um yeah yeah okay "
24939,120.4,Jazmin,,"alright so let's move on um let's see uh student can you read what your answer was please ","okay so i said yes i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
24941,230.2,Jazmin,,"so student was that answer directly from the text first ","yeah yeah it's it's in part two "
24946,420.2,Jazmin,,"right so can we get more specific to help us have a better knowledge base here do you think that maybe there's more information in the text around that section to help us get specific ","okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
24948,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay is there a name of the specific machine there that you found student ","lunar orbiter "
24951,420.2,Jazmin,,"okay great so can we all see how that gets more specific and now we know some specific science vocabulary right so that would be something you want to add to your response so just extend that circle student and i think that would be a much clearer response ","yeah that makes sense no washing machine "
24955,120.4,Chris,,"let's move on so um student could you please read your response out loud ","okay so i said scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24961,120.3,Chris,,"let's go back to the question can you maybe the first ","what equipment do scientists use Okay it's asking what equipment. "
24963,210.3,Chris,,"yeah what equipment okay and did your answer have anything about the equipment in it ","no but but i went to nasa actually i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks but also have masks and suits "
24967,210.4,Farrah,,"Does anybody have that in the in the question, what was this equipment, helping them to do. Farrah yeah. ","i'm to discover water on the moon "
24970,210.2,Farrah,,"okay to discover when i discover something did i know where it was before that ","no um i think when you discover something it's like for the first time "
24974,210.2,Oliver,,"discover means for the first time ","um well i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each answer on and helping each person all back to the question and understand what they needed to work on you were so specific and helpful thank you so much "
24976,210.2,Farrah,,,"hello hi how are you "
24978,210.2,Farrah,,,"we're great we're so excited to work with you today "
24981,150.1,Luis,,"so um did you all read the text about water on the moon ","um yeah we all read it but i i don't think i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
24983,140.1,Luis,,"so could you please tell us what do you know about space and why do you think it's interesting ","oh well space is so cool because it's so mysterious like how big is the universe we don't even know we just know we have our planet and we have the milky way but the world could be the universe could be enormous and there could even be life out there "
24985,120.3,Luis,,"yeah definitely definitely agree so the universe is so mysterious and there is very large space for us to explore so um do you know what is our question for today ","um yeah it is it's right here it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
24989,120.4,Chris,,"so could class tell me how do you think about this question so what's your answer to this ","oh yeah okay well i can go so my answer is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
24992,230.2,Chris,,"yeah so could you please tell me more like about how you figure dthat out so where did you find that information in this text ","yeah so i think that was what the first part part one it says in the very first sentence actually scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
24995,120.1,Chris,,"so did you have any other thoughts about it if we just look at this paragraph especially the second sentence ","i guess i was i was picturing the really big craters and um like pools or lakes of water because craters are really big right "
24998,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah yeah definitely okay so if we can look at the second if we can look at the fourth sentence this lunar orbiter looks for ice the deposits in a large polar crater so what do you think is this ice deposits refer to student ","okay well it says so the ice deposits are like the water actually it's frozen water because it's ice and that's that's the water they found and um actually student i think it says it's really small it's microscopic yeah that's why that's why we picked our answer me and student we said you'd need the microscope to find the water so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25003,210.4,Farrah,,"however if we take a look a sentence earlier like the water they found is microscopic so here the word microscopic could you please use another word to replace it so what which word would you use student ","i would say tiny "
25007,130.2,Jazmin,,"so if we take a step further to see what kind of equipment scientists use to find water which other answers can you get from this paragraph student ","oh well okay i said that nasa sent a small machine "
25009,130.2,Chris,,,"i wanted to add to that because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25013,110.3,Luis,,"wow that's so cool so they have a lot of equipments as you have mentioned yeah ","um in part one or part two "
25015,110.3,Luis,,,"okay um scientists have found evidence of water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters "
25017,120.3,Luis,,"yeah and um could you also please read for us the first sentence of part two ","okay okay nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
25019,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah thank you that's great so here we saw the name of a lunar orbiter so could class tell me what is a lunar orbiter here in this paragraph so what is this function ","oh i think i can i can do it "
25021,210.4,Jazmin,,,"it well it says investigate and that means to to search for something and to try and look for it so i think that the machine is finding where on the moon the water is "
25027,120.4,Oliver,,"and student could you please tell us ","yeah yeah well so um it sounds like the right answer is actually the lunar orbiter and i i'm so sorry to do this um but i looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say the way you helped us understand what we were um the way you helped us understand what we didn't understand was really helpful because you explained that microscopic didn't mean they had to use a microscope and you helped us find the right machine in the text so thank you for being so clear with how to use the text "
25030,120.4,Farrah,,,"hello "
25037,420.1,Luis,,"so what i want to do now is to circle one or two no more than three keywords and phrases that you think the most important in this question so remember it should be something that leads you to your response so let's take a few minutes to do that ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25039,420.1,Luis,,,"okay i'll take a look "
25041,420.1,Chris,,,"i think we're ready "
25044,120.4,Oliver,,"great okay so tell me about the word phrase that you just circled ","i picked up from the question the word equipment "
25047,120.4,Oliver,,"okay so on student could you please read for me your answer ","yeah okay well i forgot the same answer as student that is um microscope "
25052,130.2,Jazmin,,"so could anyone tell me what is the action in this question. ","oh i have my hand raised "
25056,130.2,Jazmin,,,"okay um yeah it's student i picked the action that's why i raised my hand and the action and the question is discover and so my answer was about the small machine and and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25060,430.2,Jazmin,,"and the paragraphs from where you extracted your answer so you should just like give the name of the machine and to be more specific okay ","yeah um it's called the moon let me find it on lunar orbiter "
25065,150.1,Chris,,"so could class like to have a dialogue about that ","yeah um i i have an idea "
25068,120.4,Chris,,"let's go ahead ","okay well um so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25073,430.2,Chris,,"you should like make your answer more aligned with what the text is exactly talking about right so could you please tell me the name of the machine that appeared in this text ","well i gues it's what student said maybe "
25075,130.3,Chris,,"the lunar orbiter right ","yeah that wasn't the story "
25077,230.1,Farrah,,"okay so you just me you come up with the answer lunar orbiter but i also noticed the other people who had different answers so for those who have different from lunar orbiter could you please tell me how you come up with that answer ","yeah i'm oh this is student so i found my answer in part three in paragraph three where they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25080,230.2,Farrah,,"so student could you please tell me that in the sentences were in the lines that you found a word microscope where did it specify the function of microscope ","Who, I really want to keep going but it's time for us to go. "
25083,120.3,Luis,,"all right you all gave such great responses to this question now i just want us to all take a look back at the question i'm going to read it and if you could just follow along yes student ","up yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25091,120.4,Chris,,"all right would class like to share what were they circled ","so that i circled is all water "
25093,110.1,Jazmin,,"water great okay that's a great idea student ","okay well i circled discover "
25097,130.2,Farrah,,"did class circle something different student ","yeah actually i circled of equipment "
25102,210.3,Farrah,,"but did they use a microscope to find the water on the moon ","oh well i guess i was thinking yes because how can you find something if you can't see it "
25105,110.1,Jazmin,,"well that's fair yeah that's definitely fair okay ","um yeah so my answer was that nasa center small machine head so i don't understand why my answers room "
25109,110.2,Jazmin,,"it's not wrong they definitely did use a small machine ","and i can i can tell you where i found it i found it in part to the beginning of part two "
25114,110.2,Jazmin,,"and that definitely is part of the equipment scientists used to discover water on the moon ","oh no i just circled small machine "
25118,230.2,Oliver,,"student what you circle you said you circle the same thing as student can you tell me exactly which part of the text you circled ","oh yeah well i just supposed to work on my scope i'm i'm still a little confused about why the small machine is there um because i thought it was just a microscope and i don't think i want to pick small machine "
25120,130.2,Luis,,"yeah that's fair does class have have some input for student as to why the small machine is also important student ","okay so student the machine is called a lunar orbiter and so the orbiter it i'm excited to where the water is because a microscope a microscope is really small like depth can you picture astronaut walking around the big giant mode like a tiny little less that would take "
25122,150.1,Oliver,,"that's a really good point anything i think that's a great explanation does that make sense ","yeah so what they did use a microscope at some point right "
25124,130.2,Chris,,"absolutely student do you want to clarify that ","well i was just going to add since we're talking about all the equipment that i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25130,150.1,Oliver,,"So Oliver are you still wondering about the microscope can we explain that a little better. ","are so um yeah i'm still wondering about when they use it "
25132,130.2,Oliver,,"yeah does class know when they use it based on the text we can look in part three ","so "
25135,210.4,Jazmin,,"does class know what the differences yeah go ahead student ","i'm so sorry for himself when he described it this when when the text makes you think of something but it's not on the page "
25140,210.4,Oliver,,"and then those water particles were so small that you would need a microscope to see them when would they use that microscope ","oh um maybe like after after the lunar orbiter "
25143,210.4,Oliver,,"absolutely i think you're exactly right to the end i'm no expert on space exploration but i think that from the text we can make an inference that says first they go with the lunar lunar orbiter and then they go in with the microscope yes ","um well i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i'm going to say thank you so much for helping us use the keywords to answer the question and also understanding how to make an inference about the best answer i feel like i learned a lot even in just a few minutes thank you "
25146,110.1,Luis,,"hello friends thank you so much for revising your responses to the question what equipment did scientists us to discover water on the moon so student student and student thank you for sharing your revised responses um does class want oh yes student ","um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already corrected my answer "
25149,150.1,Luis,,"well we are working towards the fullest most correct answers to this question possible together so we're going to try to help each other as a class come to responses that completely answered the question does that sound okay ","um yeah i guess okay "
25151,530.1,Luis,,"great so student now that you're participating already would you mind telling me what you're thinking was when you went back to try to revise your response ","yeah sure so my first answer once about oxygen tanks which i'm well i still kind of think that's true but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so then i found the equipment and the story which is the machine "
25156,310.1,Jazmin,,"I really appreciate how you went back to the text and found evidence to include in your answer. ","yes um i found more evidence in the text when i revise my answer because it wasn't it didn't have enough information from the text i needed more evidence to make it clearer "
25161,310.1,Farrah,,"that's a great point ","um well okay i would say i did that too but what i did more was i reread the question "
25164,230.1,Farrah,,"when you read that question did you circle keywords or underline things what was your strategy there ","yeah i looked more at the word discover "
25167,210.2,Farrah,,"great discover what's another important word in the question that we might want to focus on to make sure we're answering it completely ","equipment equipment and discover yeah that's how i changed my answer "
25170,110.1,Oliver,,"that's great ","um yeah i change my answer too "
25173,120.4,Oliver,,"that's awesome do you want to tell me your revised answer ","yeah um i cricled lunar orbiter same thing as student "
25182,120.4,Chris,,"alright would class like to share what they wrote for those questions student go ahead ","well first i was wondering is my new answer okay "
25185,230.2,Chris,,"absolutely so let's go over your new answer the water scientists found on the moon was microscopic so what did you do when you went back to the text to find this answer what was your strategy ","when i read the text again like a really carefully on and that's how i found out the water was microscopic which is kind of near the end of the story and i think when i read it the first time i really focused on the beginning of the story "
25189,230.3,Chris,,"we went back to the text and we looked for evidence right what else did we look back at to make sure that we were answering ","the question "
25192,210.2,Luis,,"does class want to talk about keywords again who's got a keyword for me ","student it's equipment and also discover "
25195,110.4,Chris,,"equipment and discover or two great words ","yeah i was thinking water "
25197,420.2,Chris,,"water great okay so equipment discover and water so keeping in mind those keywords and using that evidence from the text can you look at your revised answer and make sure that you answered the question completely ","equipment discover water my answer does not have equipment "
25200,420.2,Chris,,"so you can use that strategy we're already using to go back and look at that evidence in the text and then revise your answer to make it a little bit more complete and address every part of the question does that sound good ","yeah yeah "
25203,420.2,Oliver,,,"and i'm really sorry i wish we could keep going but we have to go now it's time for us to go "
25207,150.1,Luis,,"hi class i'm so excited to meet you my name is teacher and i'm excited to be here so we're talking about this article about water on the moon right ","um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25212,210.2,Jazmin,,"yeah student what do you know about the word equipment ","equipment is like a tool or like something you use to do something "
25215,210.2,Jazmin,,"and if you were an artist maybe some equipment you would use would be a marker so equipment is a tool that you use to do your job and if you were a scientist you would be using some equipment to help you discover water on the moon right ","yeah "
25217,120.4,Farrah,,"so we're thinking about what tools or what equipment it scientists use to discover water on the moon so student can you remind me what your answer was what did what equipment did they use to discover water on the moon ","okay so i said that you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely "
25219,120.4,Oliver,,"oh ok and then student can you tell me what you said as your as your answer ","yeah i circled the same as student "
25222,210.4,Farrah,,"but i'm wondering student could you read out loud the second paragraph that starts with nasa in the moon is a desert and student while while she's reading could you listen for what tool they talk about that helps them discover water ","okay "
25224,210.4,Farrah,,"well or we could all so we could all look for what tool nasa uses to help discover okay go ahead student ","part two okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposit in a large polar crater these ice deposits are very small "
25226,210.4,Oliver,,"excellent student thank you so much so student what what kind of tool were they using there they were they were looking for water what were they doing what were they using ","in that part they talked about the lunar orbiter i guess "
25229,210.4,Jazmin,,,"yeah well with with what student just said that was actually my answer i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25232,130.1,Jazmin,,"oh your answer is not wrong they did send a small machine so that's equipment that they would use ","Red. "
25235,210.3,Chris,,"are there any other words you would use to describe this marker ","i would say it's like a thin marker "
25240,210.3,Jazmin,,"what kind of small machine did they send ","well it says i don't know what it looks like or anything but it says it's a lunar orbiter right that's what student read "
25243,310.1,Chris,,"yeah a lunar orbiter yeah so that's the name of it that's getting more specific and more into the details that the the writer used ","yeah well it's more of a comment actually so i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25247,210.3,Chris,,"when they're do you think that they're wearing their oxygen masks and wearing the suits ","yeah well they would have to to stay alive on the moon "
25250,210.4,Chris,,"i wonder if you could i wonder if you could read the the second sentence in paragraph two ","yeah i can do that oh it says this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
25252,210.4,Chris,,"ooh so we're building our details of what this orbiter could look like and we're kind of even if we don't know what a lunar orbiter is we're kind of making some guesses right so what do you think it's a small we know it's a small machine and student what else do we know about it now ","um it can go deep into the crater to find the ice "
25256,210.4,Luis,,"yeah what do you think what kind of guesses do you have for what it's using to get into the into the crater ","um well i think it's kind of like a robot and so it can kind of like go around well it's called an orbiter and so that means it goes around the moon and so i think probably they're using like some kind of signal maybe and they scan the moon like a scanner for water maybe i don't know that's what i think "
25260,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah these are such good guesses right and that's a great way to use what you already know about the word orbiter to understand what a lunar orbiter is ","i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock. and it's time for us to go to lunch but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for really helping us look at and find and think about the details about the lunar orbiter that really helped and finding the most specific answer for the question "
25266,420.3,Luis,,"i want you to look for one piece of equipment in just that paragraph and circle it ","um i think i got this all figured out now so i'm good "
25268,120.4,Luis,,"oh could you student could you tell me what piece of equipment you circled in part two ","um well i mean you said that okay equipment as like a lots of things because they said equipment not piece of equipment so i figured you could say everything like lunar orbiter microscope oxygen tanks yep "
25273,120.4,Luis,,"student what did you circle ","well paragraph two that's where they talk about the lunar orbiter "
25275,230.1,Luis,,"oh exactly student so what made you think that the lunar orbiter was the piece of equipment they're talking about in paragraph two ","um well they say it's a machine a small machine and machine can be equipment "
25279,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah go ahead student ","i say it's like something you use to do a task "
25281,210.4,Luis,,"okay so student would you say that a lunar what is a lunar orbiter what kind of task is a lunar orbiter trying to do ","okay so what it says in part two investigates in the polar craters "
25284,230.3,Farrah,,"whoo okay so we're applying what we know about equipment that it's a tool that does something and it's investigating in the polar craters ","i'm i'm kind of confused "
25286,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah what what are you confused about can you tell me can you tell me ","yeah well you told us to look in paragraph two but what about paragraph three and the microscope "
25290,150.1,Farrah,,"oh okay well let's jump to that one and then we'll come back to number two ","okay microscope um because they say the water is microscopic and they can't see it without the microscope "
25292,210.4,Farrah,,"so a microscope is a tool that does what ","it lets them see the the tiny ice deposits "
25295,210.4,Farrah,,,"Well, I mean it's what Luis said that machine the lunar orbiter. "
25299,230.1,Chris,,"how do you know that the that the microscope is equipment and not like the water that they found ","they say it's a tool of microscope visit tool and we know on in science class miss bradley always says okay let's take out the equipment on and so it's like the microscope and the bunsen burner and stuff like that "
25304,230.1,Oliver,,"student what about for number two how do you know that a lunar orbiter is a piece of equipment ","i didn't really get at first that it was because i thought it was just a microscope if you look again they use the word machine to describe it um and i guess yeah a machine that's like equipment not because at you design a machine to to do something so it could be an equipment "
25306,530.1,Oliver,,"what made you change your thinking on that ","i heard i'm student talking about the lunar orbiter and you said to look at part two "
25308,530.1,Oliver,,,"so i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 "
25313,140.1,Oliver,,"wow ","they need so much equipment on the moon they need to build the base so they could breathe on the moon all sorts of things "
25318,140.1,Chris,,"do you think they would how do you think data or no sorry student how do you think that the nasa scientists could use the lunar orbiter and the discovery of water as a starting point for building a base on the moon ","well people need water they could drink the water "
25321,140.1,Chris,,"yeah and how do you think that would lead to us being able to build a base on the moon ","well or if there's water on the moon people can live there because i mean they could bring some water but eventually it be gone so they could drink more water from the moon "
25325,140.1,Chris,,"that's going to be possible and what year was it 2024 ","yeah yes three years away yeah i definitely want to go i'm ready all live on the moon any day "
25328,140.1,Jazmin,,"based on our reading ","and since there's water on the moon maybe because you use equipment like gardening equipment and they could make a moon garden so that we could grow food "
25330,230.1,Jazmin,,"what what makes you think that ","well that's a good use of water and if we're going to have a base on the moon we need some food and sustainable food "
25334,140.1,Jazmin,,"i'm student do you think that we'll be able to plant things on the mooon ","yeah we not be so cool we don't have like a moon greenhouse "
25337,210.3,Jazmin,,"i wonder if we're missing some pieces i think we might be missing some pieces for growing things on the moon student like what about soil ","oh yeah i guess the moon dirt it may not work i don't know we have to try it "
25340,140.1,Oliver,,"oh yeah we might want we might want to experiment with that student what were you gonna say ","well i just locked up o'clock now and we have to go to lunch now what i want to say thank you so much for really helping us understand the word equipment on and what it means and how to use it on and how to find the different equipment in the text i feel like i understand that so much better now thank you "
25342,140.1,Farrah,,,"hi hi hi "
25345,120.2,Luis,,"um so earlier today you read about water on the moon and then you answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and you need to just circle the evidence in the text ","um yeah so um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25356,210.4,Jazmin,,"on and i'm curious if you could identify what the small machine was called ","yeah well i'm i'm actually i'm i'm wondering i i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25363,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class remember ","yes yes and nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25366,130.3,Farrah,,"fully answer the question right so um what I was really looking for here was the name of the machine was the Lunar orbiter on to investigate the water yeah Farrah. ","well um i i guess the lunar orbiter is the right answer but i don't really understand why because if you if it's so small don't you need to see it before you could discover it "
25370,210.4,Oliver,,"um and then after they got they collected the materials with the orbiter then they were able to put them under a microscope and really analyze it and see that it was made up of water and dirt and other things like that yeah def ","oh well um well i thought it was the microscope to just like student i circled the same the same the same thing but what you just said it sounded to me like like a metal detector like the lunar orbiter as kind of like a metal detector and it says where it is and then then you dig out the metal and then you can look at what it is is it like that "
25372,210.4,Chris,,"yes i think that's a really great way of putting it it is kind of like a detector that discovers where the water might be and then we can use the of the microscope to analyze it yeah student ","well i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25374,110.3,Luis,,"yes that is so true and student you actually had a great response to where you brought some of that into it right ","i sure did "
25379,210.4,Luis,,"then yeah all those other cool machines come into play after the fact after they're able to find the water ","okay so you're saying that like it's not the right answer because i'm so oxygen tanks isn't the right answer because that's not how they find the water "
25382,140.1,Luis,,"i'm not sure if you class saw it from nasa where a woman was talking about how someday they hope to live for longer periods on the moon and if ","i definitely want to live on the moon "
25387,140.1,Oliver,,"i know wouldn't it be crazy and if they can discover water than they could turn that into things like oxygen for their oxygen tanks or ","oh that's okay happens all time i looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch but i just wanted to say before before we go you really helped us understand the different purposes of the different appointments and why the lunar orbiter was the right answer for this question and i just wanted to say it was so helpful to work with you today thank you so much "
25389,140.1,Oliver,,,"thank you "
25393,150.1,Luis,,"um but after after hearing them i think that some might be too specific and some may be too general i think that you're all just slightly off student ","um well i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25396,150.1,Luis,,"um and i think student although your response was very interesting i think that we can fine tune it a little to make it even better okay ","yeah okay "
25406,420.3,Jazmin,,"so go ahead and underline the specific detail where it says how the scientists discovered the water and what equipment they used okay so underline that right now ","excuse me "
25408,420.3,Jazmin,,,"oh well i already circled the equipment when we answered the question "
25411,110.1,Jazmin,,"yeah okay ","i said nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answers wrong "
25415,110.1,Jazmin,,,"okay "
25418,210.3,Luis,,"and i also want you to think about um if after looking at the text if you want to modify your response at all does class feel like they want to modify their or change their answer ","um yeah so when i read the story i found two pieces of equipment and they're a small machine which by the way student is called a lunar orbiter and and the microscope those are the two equipments "
25425,120.3,Chris,,"okay yeah in the text student ","i can read it okay it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i went to nasa actually on so i know that the scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25427,210.4,Chris,,"the sure do they sure do and all of that stuff helps them i'm sure um and i think that it's this part where it says they sent the lunar orbiter to investigate what do you think they're investigating what does it say they're investigating with that ","oh the craters that was part of my answer "
25429,210.4,Oliver,,"yes i love that and what what did they find in the craters when they used that machine student ","um they found really really tiny pieces of ice "
25432,210.4,Farrah,,"yes and student i think you might know the answer to this but what what did they use to look at the ice ","yeah you need a microscope because it's too small to see without the microscope um so is that the right answer "
25440,150.1,Oliver,,"so i think that um do you class want to modify your response now to make sure that it hat encompasses all that yeah def ","yeah well we definitely will but right now we have to go to lunch but yeah i wanted to say before we go thank you so much for allowing each of us to share our answers and helping us see how each of our answers were like a piece of the answer and how to work together with them "
25444,150.1,Farrah,,"i love that you class thank you so much and if when you come back next time try to reflect a little bit about how you learned from this experience deb thank you so much for that response you class did a wonderful job today thank you all so much ","hi hi how are you "
25446,150.1,Farrah,,,"we're good we're really excited to work with you "
25449,150.1,Luis,,"awesome i'm excited to hear about what you understand in these paragraphs ","um yeah okay um excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25451,110.3,Luis,,"well i'm excited for you to share all your knowledge with your other classmates ","oh yeah i can definitely do that "
25454,150.1,Farrah,,"um do you all have some responses that you've prepared about the text that you read about water on the moon ","on yes we do um do you wanna do you want to hear them "
25456,120.4,Farrah,,"yes would class like to volunteer to go first ","yeah yeah i want to go is that okay "
25459,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25461,120.4,Oliver,,"Would anyone else, like to share, you can raise your hand if you're ready. ","um yeah well i would just say i'm actually i circled the same as student "
25463,110.2,Luis,,"awesome thank you for sharing yeah they do say exactly in the text you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely gov would you want to share oh yeah student go for it ","yeah okay well my answer was actually that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
25467,230.2,Luis,,"would you mind did you have any evidence in the texts that you had for that or is that they stand outside knowledge ","Oh um yeah. i guess it's not really in there but i just know i know that if there's people on the moon they need oxygen tanks "
25472,210.4,Jazmin,,"i think when they're looking for water on the moon they're actually sending this machine called a lunar orbiter so they're not sending actual human beings are not sending astronauts ","Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong. "
25478,120.4,Farrah,,"class else have responses yeah student ","yeah so now i'm a little confused because i guess well i thought it was the microscope but it sounds like maybe student is correct so is she right or am i right "
25483,130.1,Luis,,"so you're both right they use a lunar orbiter to get to the moon and define the water but then in order to see the water they use a microscope ","yeah and i just wanted to add what i know to that clarification which is because you said there are no people there on the moon so then they had to bring i bet they had to bring like the little ice deposit back to earth and that's when they probably looked under the microscope right "
25485,210.4,Luis,,"yeah i think so i actually don't know i think it's possible that the lunar orbiter maybe had a microscope in it and then it was all done with robots but that's a great question ","robots are awesome "
25487,110.1,Chris,,"awesome i think so too yeah student ","yeah well actually i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25492,140.1,Chris,,"and i think they do use those special suits that's really cool did you see anything else there that you thought was interesting oh ","we got to see a lot of things like we got to see the whole space suit and i really wanted to try it on but and then we got to see parts of rockets and other things that the astronauts have inside the rockets like likes back like the packets of the of the space food and stuff "
25494,140.1,Chris,,"he did a space food look like it tasted good or does it look kind of disgusting what do you think ","it looks pretty disgusting really "
25496,110.3,Oliver,,"that's really cool that sounds like an awesome trip paris and thanks for sharing yeah student ","okay um i just want to make extra sure i understand the answer to the question so as there's the right answer both the right answer is like lunar orbiter plus microscope equals right answer "
25499,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class can class summarize what those two machines were student i think you just had it would class else like to build on that ","yes can i try and "
25501,130.2,Jazmin,,,"okay so i'm going to change my first answer and i'm going to say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter and then in parentheses not a toaster and then i would say and then they had to use a microscope "
25504,210.4,Oliver,,"yes perfect and do you remember what they were using the microscope for ","oh yeah i thought that i can add on that you'll start to look really closely at the little ice and i'm i just i just looked at the clock and actually we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for taking all of our answers and showing us how they fit together to make the most complete answer that was really helpful "
25509,210.4,Luis,,,"i'm excuse me teacher i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25513,120.2,Chris,,"alright we are gonna get started talking about your responses to the question what equipment it's scientists use to discover water on the moon ","first okay i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
25520,120.4,Farrah,,"who would like to go next ","i'll go "
25522,120.4,Farrah,,,"okay um so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
25529,120.4,Jazmin,,"what class else like to share ","i don't understand why my answers wrong "
25531,120.4,Jazmin,,"hmm yeah could you read your answer for me ","yeah i said nasa send a small machine "
25538,420.2,Jazmin,,"i would encourage you to go back and look in the article to just make your correct answer even stronger because a small machine could be a lot of different things but we want to make sure we're talking really specifically about the type of small machine but the scientists were using ","teacher oh oh okay yeah i see that that's it's just it's a lunar orbiter i just have to add that to my answer and then i'm done oh that's easy okay well scientists into small machine called her "
25540,110.1,Jazmin,,"her mm hmm okay ","okay i got it can i go "
25542,150.1,Oliver,,"on not yet i think we're gonna we're going to talk a little bit more about what student had for his answer ","oh yeah i circled the same thing that student did you "
25545,230.1,Oliver,,"can you tell me a little bit about your thinking thinking about the the microscope answer ","yeah i kinda the thought question was asking about equipment what equipment it to us until i was looking in but text for everywhere they said equipment and i was looking for where they're finding and water and the moon so but but paragraph paragraph three had all of the keywords in it yeah "
25553,420.3,Oliver,,"so i'd encourage you to go back into the text and and think more about discovery ","okay i feel like i didn't see the word discovery on that's what i saw found in paragraph three "
25557,210.4,Chris,,"but thank you for that clarification that's a good point, because I think you're right that they don't use the word discover in the article. ","yeah okay um i think i've found the one that student was talking about but then i was thinking about equipment because you said that's the part that was missing in my answer and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25563,210.4,Chris,,"to find water on the moon so thinking about the context of the question in what specific situation or scientists using this kind of equipment and we know that it's using water on the moon so going back into the text ","yeah thanks teacher okay. "
25566,210.4,Oliver,,,"teacher that's not a question or an observation i look up a time and i realized that it's time for us to go so on we will see you later okay "
25568,210.4,,,,"teacher "
25570,210.4,All,,,"hi "
25572,150.1,Luis,,"hi alright so today we're going to talk a little bit about your responses to the question about the article we read about nasa would class like yeah student ","excuse me teacher i don't think i should be in this class biology know all about space "
25574,140.1,Luis,,"who can you tell me one thing that you know about space ","yeah okay i'll tell you three things first accidents have to wear spacesuits because it's really cold and they'll like freeze to death second they have to wear oxygen tanks because you can't breathe them space and third there's no gravity there so they got to wear gravity boots "
25577,120.4,Luis,,"but i'm excited to hear how you connect all that knowledge to what we learned about in the article about the equipment for finding water do you want to tell me a little bit about your response to the question based on the article we read ","yeah sure okay i said what did i see i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
25582,420.3,Luis,,"astronauts might be wearing when they go to outer space so my suggestion to you is to go back into the article and to think a little bit about not what scientists may be wearing but what equipment they might be using ","okay okay "
25584,120.4,Chris,,"would class else like to share well student goes back to read the article ","i can share my oh answer was scientists phone craters full of water on the moon "
25588,210.4,Chris,,"what did you think was interesting about how they found the water did was there anything that stuck out to you ","how they found the water i don't think i remember that part of the story let me see "
25590,120.4,Jazmin,,"while student goes back to read what class else like to share their responses ","um yeah i don't understand why why my answers wrong "
25592,120.4,Jazmin,,"hmm could you read your answer for me ","yeah i said scientists sent a small machine out nasa sent a small machine "
25594,210.4,Jazmin,,"huh yeah definitely so do you have any ideas about what type of machine they might have sent to you remember that from the passage ","let me see i'll call the lunar orbiter "
25598,120.4,Jazmin,,"would class else like to share ","i just have to add that i just have that lunar orbiter to my answer and then it's fine "
25600,530.1,Jazmin,,"and then after you're finished i'm curious if you could share about how you're thinking has changed from your original answer to the second answer that you that you wrote ","well i added the name so i had to master some small machine and now it says nasa said it's a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25602,530.1,Jazmin,,,"i just i added the name "
25606,210.4,Jazmin,,"do you know what a lunar orbiter is ","it's a machine. that they use to find water "
25609,210.4,Oliver,,"mm hmm and let's maybe you can think a little bit we can break down that nate and so do you know what lunar means ","about the moon that means about the moon "
25611,210.4,Chris,,"yeah thank you you're right yeah and then or better does class know what the word orbiter means or the orbit ","yeah that's that's the path that you when you go like around something you know like how "
25615,210.4,Chris,,,"we we like the sun you know like we go around yeah yeah i have to think for a second like do we call this week around the sun "
25618,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah definitely so student now using what your classmates have shared about what it is so it's something about the moon and it's something that's going around something else what do you think a lunar orbiter would be doing on ","um i think it's a machine that goes around "
25624,210.4,Jazmin,,"how do you think scientists were using that particular piece of equipment to find water ","okay you're using this to you went around the moon maybe and looked for water like flew around the moon maybe or or or drove around the moon "
25627,120.4,Chris,,"alright what class else like okay okay good yeah would class else like to share ","before the issue the response i was just thinking about um the other kinds of equipment that we're talking about with even because i went to nasa into i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25634,150.1,Chris,,"does that help ","yeah yeah yeah to kind of think more more with the just what we're talking about in the story "
25636,150.1,Oliver,,,"oh oh teacher it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for how you were asking questions about our thinking i'm to help with the answers and kind of taking time to explain what we needed to work on because it gave me some ideas on how i can improve my answer to "
25638,150.1,Oliver,,,"bye teacher "
25641,120.4,Luis,,"does class with class like to go first student firsthand what's up ","wow excuse me i shouldn't be in this class because i already corrected my answer so i'm good "
25647,230.1,Luis,,"awesome so um what's what what makes you say that what makes you say that scientists found is using a small machine ","because that paragraph two yeah class that's what it says in paragraph two it says nasa's into small machine blah blah blah look for ice deposit blah blah blah and so they found the ice using a small machine "
25653,210.4,Luis,,"what is the actual name of the small machine ","oh yeah it's the lunar orbiter i forgot to put that in there "
25657,230.2,Luis,,"so you found that from the text right ","yeah yeah i did "
25662,520.1,Luis,,"so i suggest that the next time you have a question like this you read through the text and look for those key specific words that might help you have a more rounded out answer ","okay okay "
25665,150.1,Luis,,"does that make sense ","it does i mean i just like don't like to write you know i mean i feel like when i get the answer i got it and that's good "
25667,520.1,Luis,,"Now that we figured out the full answer what could you do next time so that you don't have to revise and revise and revise. ","okay next time i guess i could just like be specific when i'm writing my answer "
25676,510.1,Luis,,"i think that a little bit of specificity and putting a little bit of effort up top may have to save you the trouble of having to revise it several times ","okay i used to think that i just care right small machine or equipment but now i think i gotta always write the name of the thing in my answer because because the teacher says that i got to be more specific so next time i guess i will write more specific names of things when i am writing my answer so you don't have to revise and revise and revise "
25678,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay we'll leave that there student you have a question or a comment ","um yeah well i i changed my answer to "
25680,110.1,Jazmin,,,"yeah yeah i did it while i'm while you're talking to student "
25683,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay why don't you share with us ","okay um so he said nasa use the machine called the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of frozen water in craters on the moon "
25686,230.1,Jazmin,,"that's your revised answer ","yeah "
25690,530.1,Jazmin,,"what was different about your first answer and your second you said ","my first answer i just said nasa send a small machine "
25693,510.1,Jazmin,,"i sort of noticed that through talking with student i mean that you also added some specificity to your answer do you think that helped you get a more full response ","yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity "
25699,520.1,Jazmin,,"okay what could you do next time you get a question like this ","short um okay well next next time i could i guess well first off i know that i was supposed to write the name of it i guess that's the same as student to be more specific with the name um and then also um what else did i add oh oh the why i added why though the white part because the teachers that's what the teacher said that i was missing to "
25702,120.4,Jazmin,,"and student or student do either one of you want to share sure student ","yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay um the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK. "
25710,120.2,Jazmin,,"what i have a question for you what do you feel like if the question is what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","i forgot again oh man hold on i was supposed to be adding in the equipment part yeah okay okay i got it now oh yeah the water scientists found on the moon with the lunar orbiter was microscopic "
25713,110.4,Oliver,,"that's right so we have the name of the lunar orbiter ","i know teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but it looks like it's actually time for us to go i'm so off to see you later okay "
25717,230.3,All,,"you would revise your revisions so you revise revise that the water found the water scientists found water on the moon using a lunar orbiter and that the water was microscopic is that correct ","yeah yeah "
25720,230.3,Luis,,,"i i just i think i got it figured out now so i think i'm all good "
25726,230.1,Chris,,"yeah so you you clarified response which is which is great what helped you find the title of ","um okay well i'm student had had it before so i remembered that it was in the second paragraph and i'm that well i was looking for the ice part of it because at first i didn't realize that was the water too and so yeah that was it was pretty easy to find "
25728,210.2,Chris,,"so when you're faced with the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon what's the important word in that question do you think ","oh discover "
25733,520.1,Chris,,"what do you think you could do going forward to make sure that we are looking for what the question is asking ","i think but i got a mixture of it i'm looking at all of the words in the question cuz i missed equipment on my answer and "
25741,230.1,Chris,,"so how did you know that equipment was the most important word in that sentence or question ","oh okay well cuz when we were talking about our answers before the teacher kept telling us that that was one of the important because class else had equipment except for me i realized i forgot it and then when we're reading the question to me i heard it again and i realized i forgot it "
25747,230.3,Chris,,"that you had just forgot to to include that in your answer perhaps ","okay well for next time i guess i should check my answer with the question um then to make sure that i i answered all the parts of the question "
25752,120.4,Farrah,,"so finally miss student do you want to share your revised answer ","still kind of confused "
25756,120.4,Farrah,,"so what's your revised answered ","okay um so oh let me see where did i even write it down "
25759,120.4,Farrah,,"do you remember your first answer ","um yeah my first one was about that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely because i got that one right out of the story okay yeah i see where i wrote it down okay um and then for my revised answer i said that scientists use the lunar orbiter to discover tiny bits of water in craters on the moon "
25761,150.1,Farrah,,"that feels like a really thorough answer to me does it feel like a thorough answer to you ","yeah yeah i wrote a lot more um i mean i wrote a lot more like not words but you know like from my from my brain i'm in the second answer than because the first answer was from the story "
25765,150.1,Farrah,,"so we have the lunar orbiter in there which is specificity right student right student we were talking about specificity earlier great ","so specificity "
25777,530.1,Farrah,,"so how can i ask you a question how did you get from your first answer to your second answer how did your thinking change ","um okay so i knew that the microscope was the wrong answer because i realized that i was i had used it because it said it was looking at the water but she was asking about discovering the water um and then we already talked about you know like our supposed to put all of the parts of the question and our answer and i think i did that in my first answer but then i did it i did it more because like we keep talking about like adding more details and adding more details so i guess i'm what different is that i added more details oh i remember and i use more the words from the question in my answer to "
25780,230.3,Farrah,,"okay great so i'm hearing that you have heard class talk about being more specific and adding more details and so you're like i'm on it that's what i'm going to do and you tried that and it worked out yeah ","yeah yeah and and i added the words from the question to "
25785,230.3,Farrah,,,"okay yeah yeah no i think i can i'm okay how do i know what the questions asking um okay so what i would do is look at all of the words in the question right and then make sure that i i understand what each of the words means um and then when i find my answer try to like look in match it up between each of the words in my answer in each of the words in the question "
25795,230.3,Farrah,,"okay so that at the end you'll have some some answers that match and it makes sense for you and for others to understand that sounds pretty solid so let's do let's just do the fill in the blank like we've done before so let's do a little thinking routine about ","That. i started to think that i could just kind of find the words in the story and then that just be the answer to right but now i think that i have to make sure that i understand all the words in this question first and then find the answer and write it in my own words to feel match the question "
25798,230.3,Farrah,,,"was oh no because if i don't then i might actually have the wrong answer so next time i will "
25802,230.3,Farrah,,,"check my answer with the words in the question to make sure that they "
25804,210.3,Farrah,,"are you are you asking are you telling ","oh man okay i'm telling i'm "
25808,110.1,Oliver,,"good good final answer ","all to turn teacher it's time for us to go to lunch "
25810,110.1,Oliver,,,"well i wanted to say thank you so much for taking the time to kind of help us to think about our answers changing cause i was listening and now i have some ideas on on how to think about when i am going to change like my answer um next time i'm going to enter a question "
25812,110.1,Oliver,,,"okay bye "
25817,110.1,Luis,,"so if we could start with student he said nasa send a small machine could you tell someone ","yeah thanks for calling on me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
25820,150.1,Luis,,"all of it i think we can always learn more ","i can tell you anything you want to know "
25822,150.1,Luis,,"okay well we'll start with student and then we'll come to you how does that sound ","okay that's fine great "
25826,210.4,Jazmin,,"student you said masters kind of small machine could you look in take one minute and look in the text and tell me what that small machine was called ","ok ok nasa centers machine called a lunar orbiter "
25829,210.4,Luis,,"the lunar orbiter now does class have an idea what the lunar orbiter is ","okay so i figured this out because lunar means like moon and orbiter means like around like it goes around and an orbit and so i think the lunar orbiter as like this small machine that goes around the moon "
25833,210.4,Chris,,"student what did those scientists fine could you repeat what you said about what the scientists found with that lunar orbiter ","oh yeah suit the scientists they found these crators full of water "
25838,210.4,Chris,,"so how much water did they find could use to find in the text how much water they found ","okay yeah so in part one it says they found evidence that water can be found deep in the moon's craters okay there's the part about the lunar orbiter oh oh oh okay well i don't know if i got here yeah and part three oh it says that the water is microscopic "
25842,210.4,Farrah,,"microscopic the me thank you for finding that can class tell me what microscopic me ","yeah um well this is connected to my answer to microscopic means it's really really small and so my answer was you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and um i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
25847,120.4,Oliver,,"student could you repeat your answer as well ","um yeah well i suppose same thing as student "
25851,210.4,Oliver,,"where they're using the microscope again ","i'm okay yeah so um they use a microscope to look at a tiny on ice particles and polar craters "
25858,210.4,Chris,,"okay you can put your hands down thank you just tracking it's okay if you don't care we're looking at the little divots or shapes in the moon yes student oh ","well i know what craters are because i actually went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
25860,210.4,Luis,,"that connects to something student said earlier i think about the oxygen tanks could you tell could student could you tell me what type of scientists could use an oxygen tank ","oh yeah astronaut "
25864,210.4,Jazmin,,"but something tells me that oxygen that astronauts aren't actually on this mission could someone let's take a minute look in the text tell me why i don't think astronauts are on this mission ","well it doesn't actually say the word astronaut anywhere in the story "
25867,210.4,Oliver,,"that's a good notice you just said so even though we might be able to assume astronaut you're somewhere for this for this section we can only assume what they tell us but let's keep that in mind just in case they mention it later yes ","oh i just locked up a clock on it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for working with us today and reminding us to really look for small details and add them into one answer that is so helpful thank you so much i'm "
25874,150.1,Luis,,"we're seeing how we can use different parts of the text to talk about an earlier part ","i'm okay i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
25876,230.1,Luis,,"what do you mean all figured out ","i'm like the answer to the question i'm all set i got it "
25882,210.4,Oliver,,"did you find anything else about about the microscope passage that could help us talk about how much water there is ","okay um well student told us about part of it but also uses the word microscopic on which it has just like microscope "
25885,210.4,Oliver,,"and just to be just to be clear could someone tell me what microscopic means ","um yeah yeah that's like super super small "
25894,120.2,Farrah,,"so one more time will the water they find on the moon be valuable to them ","i'm i'm i'm a little confused still "
25898,230.1,Farrah,,"on the directions or something else ","no about the microscope because is the lunar orbiter the right answer or is it the microscope i don't get it "
25903,210.3,Farrah,,"which one do you think is correct microscopes or lunar orbiters ","me or class "
25906,210.3,Luis,,,"um well i think it's probably both i mean lunar orbiter i mean that sounds really fancy cool and it sounds like it can like find the location of the water and then microscopes are you can see it so um i think it's probably both "
25910,130.2,Jazmin,,"thank you for sharing back does class have a different answer than student ","and so i i kind of think that like the lunar orbiter is like the better answer not that microscopes is bad but i think lunar orbiter says the exact thing like the one thing they used to like discover the water like discover like find it like where it is i don't think i'm microscope could do that because only one microscope won't do a lot on a great big moon "
25912,130.2,Oliver,,,"um wow i was gonna say microscope but what student side as making me think a little bit but i still don't understand how you can find something that's too small to see how can you even discover it if you can't see it yeah "
25914,210.3,Oliver,,"um so let's try to combine some answers so what did they what did they use to get to the moon in the first place ","um well definitely not a microscope "
25916,210.3,Oliver,,"which piece of equipment did they use if it's not a microscope ","well gotta be the lunar orbiter "
25920,130.1,Oliver,,"is something you would use to find water on the moon ","um i also read that there could be a base on the moon by "
25922,230.2,Oliver,,"and where did you read that ","i'm online i'm on the site on a science website for class "
25924,210.3,Oliver,,"so if there is a base on the moon if we have two pieces of equipment lunar orbiter and microscopes which piece of equipment would they not need any more if they have a base on the moon ","lunar orbiter because like you're already there "
25929,210.4,Farrah,,"but if they're already on the moon they can have the microscopes already there there doesn't need anything to transport the microscope to the place so ","i'm so sorry because this class is so fun i'm learning so much but we have to go to lunch and i just wanted to say before we go thank you so much you really made me feel like you valued my answer and i think class probably agrees on that and you've really helped us use our thinking to find the best answer and that was really cool "
25933,230.3,Luis,,"hello i'm happy to be back with you all and i believe that we left off trying to add some more to jazmin's response trying to strengthen it and i know that we talked about we added the name of the machine the lunar orbiter and i think that we yes student ","yeah yeah i i did that so i think i got this all figured out i'm all good "
25937,120.4,Luis,,"well would you mind sharing with us how you would maybe answer this question like ","yeah so i think she should just add the name i think she should just say um i don't remember student what was your answer yeah so i think you can just say nasa's small machine called a lunar orbiter and that's a good answer "
25941,130.2,Farrah,,"does class have a different feeling about that answer do you think the student has included everything she needs to she talked about the who or anything else student ","um no she didn't have the who and i don't remember the other thing that you said we're supposed to have she has what i saw is it just who and what "
25943,130.2,Farrah,,,"will the question says or what equipment it scientists use so the scientists are the hoop "
25948,210.3,Farrah,,"so how can we add that into jazmin's response ","um i mean i guess we could still use what student said oh well she said nasa sent a small machine for me she could say um i guess nasa scientists into small machine called a lunar orbiter "
25953,210.3,Jazmin,,"where did they send it to did you include that student ","no "
25955,120.2,Jazmin,,"okay so where did they send this machine to ","get them on "
25959,210.3,Farrah,,"right so i think that that would give you a more complete or a stronger response ","i'm sorry teacher i'm still kind of confused "
25962,230.1,Farrah,,"which part are you confused about ","well because our teacher said that we're supposed to use the keywords in the question um and so the keyword in a question are some equipment scientists discover water moon those are the ones that i underlined so does that mean all of those words have to be in the answer too "
25967,150.1,Farrah,,"does that help ","yeah yeah that does "
25972,530.1,Jazmin,,"thank you okay so student do you feel like you've changed your your process for working through text and questions ","okay um so for my process at first i was just looking for the equipment and then you you said that it had to i had to i should say the name of it um and then you asked if we had the who and today anna said no but then she said yeah and you said that nasa could be the who and then we added something else but i don't remember what else we added other than the name "
25977,230.3,Chris,,"so the moon we said ","sorry i was just thinking when you set the where that are i read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024 so that could be another another thing i guess not for your answer but that's more information about the weird "
25985,120.4,Chris,,"thank you for sharing that with us that's a very interesting fact i didn't know that does class else want to try working through their response or strengthening it ","scientists phone crude is for water on the moon so i have the who and i have the weird and i guess the what is the craters okay scientists is the whole that's the same water on the moon is the same craters oh okay the equipment is wrong "
25990,210.3,Chris,,"do you see a spot maybe where you could just add that in there ","hey oh scientists sent the lunar orbiter to find craters for water on the moon "
25994,120.2,Oliver,,"i i like what you gave me there let me read the question one more time and then i can think about your answer a little bit what equipment and scientists use to discover what on and you said oh i'm sorry student yes ","i'm trying to and i love to teach i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted i wanted to say thank you for when you explain what we needed to work on and you you help me think about my strategy um i didn't even notice about like thinking about like who and what and the were in the question and trying to match it to my answer so i think that was really useful for me "
25996,120.2,Oliver,,,"okay bye teacher "
25999,120.2,Farrah,,,"hi we're great we're so excited to work with you "
26001,120.2,Luis,,,"um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26003,110.3,Luis,,"well maybe you can help us out today i think we're going to need some help as we just take a deeper look at the text does that sound good ","oh yeah of course "
26006,210.4,Chris,,"thank you wonderful so you class read about scientists and the moon and can class tell me what did they discover ","yeah it's so cool the scientists they discovered craters full of water on the moon "
26009,110.2,Oliver,,"very cool i didn't know that there was water on the moon before i read the text so that was a very interesting fact to me as well ","yeah well i thought i'm sorry um it was interesting how they said that the water is is really really small it's actually like a really really really small pieces "
26011,210.4,Farrah,,"i think that there's a word for that does class remember what word they use to describe how small the water i student ","yeah i do because it's it's kind of part of my answer they use the word microscopic and so that's why i said you'd need a microscope to discover the water so you can look at it really closely "
26018,210.2,Luis,,"so from the question who do we need to focus on ","the scientists "
26020,210.4,Chris,,"yes very good the scientists and what did they find i think we all know this one ","yeah that's the water "
26023,210.4,Jazmin,,"very good and how did they find it we know that the water was microscopic it was very small but what what type of tool did they use to find it student mentioned that they used a microscope to see the water but what what i'm what type of invention it was it had a really cool name ","yeah yeah so in my answer i said something different i said that nasa sent a small machine and so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26027,130.1,Jazmin,,"your answer is not wrong actually but it could be even better ","because that's where i found my answer it's in part two "
26029,210.4,Jazmin,,"Very good yeah so as i'm looking and i'm reading, part two, or paragraph two, I see that they called it a lunar orbiter ","i guess i wouldn't be that hard i mean i could say that the equipment is a small machine and it's called the lunar orbiter "
26033,130.2,Chris,,"i would agree what do you all think do you think that that strengthens jazmin's answer ","well yeah i think it does because now it kind of makes me imagine what what it looks like when because when you just said small machine i couldn't really picture it but also i wanted to say i kind of know what what these things might look like because i went to nasa actually i went there and i found out that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26037,230.2,Oliver,,"um i also would like to know what you class circled in the text i know that you class have formulated some answers but what what led you to your answers student ","yeah okay i'm still i'm a little confused because i circled the microscope um but it sounds like lunar orbit is supposed to be the answer and i don't totally understand why "
26039,210.2,Oliver,,"sure well let's let's think about it so the question asked us what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon so what does it mean to discover something ","like to find it for the first time "
26043,130.1,Oliver,,"so let's think about this do you think that maybe they used both of those things to find the water ","oh um that could be it because um you you find it and then you look at it "
26047,110.2,Oliver,,"i like that that's a really good way of thinking about it what does class else ","i'm so sorry i don't want to interrupt but i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us really listen to and build on each other's answers on and find the right names for the different pieces of equipment in the text just by listening to each other and talking about it that was really interesting and cool "
26050,110.2,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're really excited to work with you today "
26054,230.1,Luis,,"on what you meant by that ","um can i say something that is student over here "
26056,230.1,Luis,,,"um yeah before you start um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26059,150.1,Luis,,"and maybe they have something that they know that they can share with you how does that sound ","okay that sounds okay okay "
26061,120.4,Luis,,"great now let's give student the opportunity to answer my question ","okay go ahead student "
26064,120.4,Oliver,,,"student got me all confused "
26067,120.2,Oliver,,"i was wondering if you could expand or elaborate a little more on what you meant by you circled the same as student ","oh yeah okay i'm so sorry i know we both thought about the answer to the question about equipment was on the microscope and since she she started first so i just said i circled all the same thing instead of repeating "
26070,230.2,Farrah,,"you got your answer from did you did you circle a certain part of the text where their context clues ","yeah so i circled the sentence that said you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26072,120.4,Jazmin,,"excellent thanks student and student would you mind sharing can you share what you circled ","and so i circled small machine my answer is nasa center small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26077,210.3,Jazmin,,"so do you see student how a microscope microscope along with a small machine is used to find water on space ","oh yeah well i guess i just thought that the machine is what they use to do the discovering and i don't know the microscope maybe they don't use it to discover "
26081,120.4,Chris,,"now student can you tell us what you you wrote as your response ","yeah okay well i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon "
26084,230.2,Chris,,"that is exactly right and did you see anywhere in the text that told you what sort of equipment allowed them to find the craters ","oh well i don't know about in the text but i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26086,140.1,Luis,,"this is all true student knows this correct ","yep yep oxygen tanks are my answer to that one student "
26089,230.3,Chris,,"yep so oxygen tanks small machines microscopes these are all really important pieces of equipment that allow nasa scientists to look at water on the moon ","wow hmm maybe they need something to collect the water "
26094,120.4,Luis,,"student ","rocket ships rocket ships "
26098,130.2,Luis,,"anything else that we have ","wow the rocket ships landing gear if they're going to go on the moon they need landing gear um suits and masks student already said that food really gross food for them to eat on the trip um i think there's a lot of things really a lot of things "
26102,210.1,Luis,,"yet we're not taking a day trip to the moon they're they're there for a little while ","yeah if we could take a day trip to the moon i would have done that already "
26106,140.1,Jazmin,,"jas student you're not so interested in going to the moon ","i would rather stay here on earth and focus on protecting the earth "
26108,140.1,Jazmin,,"i like that answer what how would you plan to protect the earth do you have ideas on that ","yeah well we need to plant more trees to save the forests and we need to protect our oceans by not dumping trash and by making sure that we recycle "
26110,140.1,Farrah,,"those are really beautiful ideas thank you for sharing student student why are you interested in going to the moon ","oh well i'm actually i was gonna say i looked at the clock on and it's it's time for us to go to lunch "
26112,120.2,Luis,,"alright so hello class and as you all know we just finished reading the water on the moon text talking about the moon is a desert and we are all responding to the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this room i already know all about space "
26114,120.4,Luis,,"oh well then would you like to start do you have an answer to this question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","oh yeah well um i said that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks "
26116,210.4,Luis,,"that's a really cool insight and i really appreciate that you're bringing all this knowledge to our class but my question is is there a place in the text in the reading that we could find how the scientists use what like what oliverice they used to find the water on the moon ","um you mean like in the story "
26120,210.4,Farrah,,"was there a spot in the text talking about what oliverice things to find the water on the moon ","yeah well i said you'd need a scientific tool called microscope to look really closely "
26123,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah so that's a really good addition thank you yeah i see that in paragraph three it talks about the microscope and that's how they're looking at the water ","Is it not a microscope because how how could you discover something if if you can't see it. "
26128,210.4,Jazmin,,"so you're right we do need the microscope to see the water but i'm wondering maybe if we take a look at paragraph two is are there any other tools that the scientists were using ","yes i found my answer in paragraph two but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26130,120.4,Jazmin,,"so do you want to share answer with the class and we can work through it together ","yes well i said nasa send a small machine "
26132,230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so um so yes it definitely is a small machine but can you tell me where in the text you got the answer ","the very beginning of part two "
26135,210.4,Jazmin,,"can you read it to the to our class so we're we're on the same page ","yeah it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
26138,130.2,Farrah,,"maybe someone else can offer something ","so you're saying you're saying it's the lunar orbiter and not the microscope "
26141,130.2,Chris,,"well what do other people think does class else have a suggestion so right now we're thinking is it a microscope is it the lunar orbiter what do we think the scientists used to find the water yeah student ","oh well i went to nasa so i know that scientists he was a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26148,210.4,Oliver,,"but not class else has that but what class else does have is the reading that we just did so just to make sure that everyone's on the same page let's take a look back at the reading so again ","okay yeah well i suppose the same as something about the microscope but now student read that part about the lunar orbiter and how it investigates so now now i'm really confused i don't know which one it is because they both sound pretty good to me "
26151,210.4,Oliver,,"so nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate so what do we think the author meant by investigating what are they looking for ","um well it sounds like it was it was looking looking for is deposits right little teeny tiny ice "
26153,210.4,Oliver,,"yeah yes they're looking for the ice and so we're looking for ice and the question we're answering is about water so what do we think is the lunar orbiter looking for ice is lunar orbiter looking for water is that the same thing ","oh yeah yeah it's just water so i guess if they sent a lunar orbit are looking for ice then then it's really looking for the water "
26156,210.3,Chris,,"yeah yeah so so what what does class else thinking so now that we've had this discussion are we thinking that the lunar lunar orbiter from the water or that the microscope on the water or do you think that they're playing different roles yeah student ","well i i really like what you just said about playing different roles and i think it's i think it's that because it sounds like they sent the lunar orbiter to look for like to discover the the water in the little little ice deposit but then maybe they had to use the microscope to on over to examine it "
26160,130.2,Oliver,,"do people or agree or disagree with what student just said that the lunar orbiter with us to find or discover the water and the microscope was used to actually look at it specifically yeah ","that's that's really good answer i agree with student about that but i just i just looked at the clock and i'm so sorry but we we actually have to go to lunch right now but i really wanted to say we really appreciate how you really took your time and sent us back to look at that text and helped us understand the purpose of each of the tools and which one was the best answer for the question thank you so much "
26166,120.2,Luis,,"which was what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i alreadyknow all about space "
26169,120.4,Luis,,"um so do you want to go first so how did you answer this question ","ya sure ok i said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26175,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah all right okay perfect so um let's let's go around does someone want to tell me what words or phrases they circled when looking at this question yeah student ","i circled water equipment and moon "
26178,230.1,Farrah,,"all right thank you so i'm curious so why did you decide to circle equipment ","on because it's like one of the first words in the question what equipment did scientists use "
26180,130.2,Oliver,,"yeah so thank you did class else circle equipment also ","um i circled equipment too "
26182,110.1,Oliver,,"great ","um i circled equipment too "
26186,230.1,Chris,,"oh great so student do you want to tell me why you decided to circle equipment ","okay because it's like when it's asking like what equipment the teacher says right after the the question if it says why did blah blah blah what did blah blah blah then the blah blah blah whatever the unitelligle is is the important one Ya so I circled water on the moon oh and also discover. "
26189,230.1,Chris,,"yeah so thank you for sharing that student so let's take a look at discover so why did you circle discover ","because that was the action "
26193,130.2,Farrah,,"so did class else circle discover ","I circle just over two because the same thing same class in our English teacher told us about looking for the action word in the in the question. "
26197,210.2,Jazmin,,"and so based on this what could we guess what do we think what piece of information is this question asking us to find ","equipment that is on the moon that discovers water "
26202,230.3,Farrah,,"okay so now going back to what student was saying he mentioned that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks in general which is great ","we're looking for equipment that they used to discover water on the moon but i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26204,120.4,Farrah,,"do you want to share it with the class yeah okay ","ya so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26207,230.2,Farrah,,"um can you tell me why did you decide to say the word microscope like where did you find that ","okay yeah well first that's equipment and then i found it in the third paragraph "
26210,210.4,Oliver,,"But my question coming after this would be what did they use this microscope for and anyone can answer this question, using the tax and using our discussion, what did the scientists use the microscope to do. ","i have the same answer so in in the text they said that they use the microscope to look really closely at the water "
26212,130.2,Jazmin,,"yeah so what does class else think do we agree with what student and student said do we have a different answer what does class think ","i have a different answer but i think that they they did use it to look closely at the water "
26215,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah i agree i do think that they use the microscope to look closely at the water but student do you want to share your answer ","yeah okay um let me see i don't remember oh yeah that nasa sent a small machine "
26219,230.1,Jazmin,,"alright so nasa sent a small machine so can you tell me why did you say that ","okay i was looking for equipment and i know that a machine is equipment and that in that paragraph they were talking about why did i say that oh look for ice deposit so they were looking for i'm looking for ice which is like discovering and looking for i think are kind of the same thing "
26222,230.1,Oliver,,,"i was thinking about equipment and i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen manks oxygen tanks and masks and suits ya student "
26225,420.2,Oliver,,"but just to make sure that we're all on the same page let's focus on the information that's in the text but maybe in the future when we're going further you can use all your nasa experience that'd be great ","i'm sorry i was looking at the clock and it's time for the next class so we'll see you next time okay "
26231,230.3,Luis,,"And just very quickly so vana brought up the idea that she said that it was a microscope was used to find the water and then we're talking with Jazmin about the small machine that she identified in the text so we're going to start there but ","i got this all figured out so i'm good "
26233,120.4,Luis,,"oh yeah do you want to share with the class ","yeah yeah okay so we're talking about equipment and discover and water and so student was like well you know how come it's not mine because microscope is equipment and i think that farrah's right "
26235,230.1,Luis,,"all right well why do you think that's farrah's right ","okay class she said it's equipment i looked at paragraph six and it does talk about water on the moon so it's got all the key things "
26239,130.2,Jazmin,,"but student what else are you going to add ","well okay so i do think it's used to look at the water on the moon but i guess i had a different answer so i'm not sure either um "
26241,150.1,Jazmin,,"we're gonna figure it out together ","okay "
26244,120.4,Jazmin,,"so do you want to offer your answer what was your different answer ","yeah well i said nasa had a small machine because that was but that was a paragraph to paragraph three "
26249,210.4,Chris,,"so we already identified that in paragraph three there's a microscope as a tool can class find a tool in paragraph two ","um it said The lunar orbiter in paragraph two. "
26252,130.2,Oliver,,"did class else identify that as a tool in this paragraph ","Oh yeah I saw that one. "
26256,210.4,Luis,,"yeah so what do we think is the function of the lunar orbiter in this paragraph ","okay it says that the moon south pole and look for is deposited in a large polar crater so that's what it that's "
26258,130.2,Jazmin,,"can someone rephrase what student just said what does the lunar lunar orbiter do ","it looks for um i was gonna say the same thing it looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater um "
26260,130.2,Jazmin,,,"that's the same thing that student said it looks for ice in polar craters "
26265,210.2,Farrah,,"yeah and so let's take a look at the question again what is the question asking us to find ","okay oh what equipment is used to find water i'm still kind of confused "
26269,150.1,Farrah,,"yeah so let's let's keep talking about it so ","um Okay, we are it's asking us about equipment that used to discover water on the moon. "
26272,120.4,Oliver,,"so using these all of this information what are we thinking ","okay yeah i got it so what the teacher saying student it's a microscope was used to look at the water but the lunar orbiter it was used to look for the water "
26276,130.2,Chris,,"what does class else think do they agree with what student said ","i think so um let me see it it'll look for ice deposits oh yeah it's looking for that okay yeah it's looking for the ice deposits okay you know what i read that there could be a piece on the moon by 2024 "
26278,110.3,Chris,,"yeah that's definitely really cool and i'm excited to see that ","i agree with what student said "
26282,530.1,Oliver,,"before our conversation i thought that the answer was this or i didn't know the answer or i was still confused or just before our conversation this is what i thought and then after the conversation that we just had now i think ","okay i think i'm ready i'm before our conversation i thought a microscope was thought right answer um and after our conversation i see that it's the lunar orbiter "
26284,120.4,Jazmin,,"what did class else write ","i said before a conversation i said nasa send a small machine but now i see that "
26288,120.4,Jazmin,,"you said they found a small machine and now you think what was the second half of your sentence ","they sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26294,130.2,Farrah,,"okay so does class else have a different response for the second half of their sentencing saying now what do i think after the conversation ","i was gonna before conversation i thought it was a microscope oh cuz it was looking at water but now i know it's a lunar orbiter because it was looking for what "
26299,310.1,Oliver,,"yeah so thank you for offering the different functions of different tools so that was a great revision ","our teacher i was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i did want to say that i i appreciate how you kept asking us questions you know to like think about the words in the question and on the words in the story so so now i'm thinking about my strategy for thinking if that makes sense "
26303,150.1,Luis,,"hi class thanks for joining me here today so we just read a short passage about water on the moon and i got to read all of your responses and i just wanted to see if we could ","um yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26305,140.1,Luis,,"oh wow that's really interesting are you really passionate about space ","oh yeah i lot of space and i really want to be an astronaut when i grow up "
26309,140.1,Luis,,"that seems like it would be a very cool job well since you know so much about space and space exploration maybe you can after we have our small class discussion tell us some interesting facts ","that's right i would love to share some of my space "
26311,120.4,Farrah,,"okay cool i think we are all really excited to hear what you have to say so i'm going to go ahead and start with student i know you have your paper in front of you student would you mind reading aloud what answer you gave to that question we had ","yeah okay so um i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26313,210.4,Farrah,,"okay great so you talked about a scientific tool called a microscope can you tell me a little bit about what they use the microscope to look at ","okay so because when they found the water it was really small they have to see it on they have to use the microscope to look at it they can't see it without the microscope "
26315,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah great response they use a microscope to look at the small small specks of water exactly have you ever used a microscope before ","oh yeah we have them in the science lab we use them in science "
26318,120.4,Jazmin,,"oh wow okay perfect so you class are all familiar with that scientific tool thank you for your answer student let's see who would like to read the response next do we have any volunteers yeah perfect go ahead student ","ok so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26321,210.4,Jazmin,,"i just wanted to ask you if you could share a little bit about what this machine with this machine was used for ","um okay so it says they sent it to investigate in craters to find that water "
26323,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah exactly they sent these machines into or onto the moon to see if they could investigate and actually look for the water perfect answer student do you happen to remember what the small machine was called or do you want to look back into the text see if you can find some evidence ","can i look back "
26325,210.4,Jazmin,,,"okay it says nasa send a small machine oh oh it's right here and a lunar orbiter "
26330,110.1,Oliver,,"yep exactly student a lunar orbiter good job ","um okay so i circled the fame of student about the microscope and i'm a little unclear about why the microscope is that the wrong answer because you said that jazmin's answer was a right answer "
26335,230.3,Oliver,,"so student student pointed out one and then you also pointed out another one similar to student which was a microscope correct ","yeah yeah we pick that same one "
26337,120.4,Chris,,"okay perfect sounds good let's see we have student and student left would either of you like to go okay go for it student ","okay well so two things one for my answer i said well that scientists be found creators full of water on the moon and so actually i went to nasa and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26340,230.1,Chris,,"yeah you're right they use tons of equipment like the ones that you mentioned and you kind of talked about how um they found craters full of water on the moon can i ask you what makes you say that ","okay so when part one they say that the scientists found evidence that water can be found in the moon's polar creators so i know that craters are these big score so sort of like holes but above ground and so i'm picturing these critters full of water like lakes of water because craters are so big "
26343,210.4,Chris,,"that you got to see there which one of those has been mentioned in this passionate in this passage in which one of those do you believe help the scientists get to these craters and actually find the water ","oh like pick one of the ones in the story "
26345,210.4,Chris,,,"oh okay um well i think student sounds really good about the lunar orbiter i don't know if i saw that one but i definitely saw other small machines that they launched into space "
26347,140.1,Chris,,"oh wow did you get a chance to take any pictures maybe you could bring them to class and show us one day ","oh yeah my dad took so many pictures it was actually kind of embarrassing "
26350,120.4,Luis,,"but thank you so much for your answer student and i think it is now time to move on to student are you ready to share your answer student ","yeah i am so my answer i said well if kind of like kara since actually cuz i said that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26352,230.1,Luis,,"okay and what makes you say that they use oxygen tanks ","yeah well if there's astronauts up there on the moon i know 100 they have oxygen tanks "
26354,230.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah i said if there's astronauts on the moon i know for sure without a doubt that they have oxygen tanks "
26356,230.1,Luis,,"exactly and where have you seen that information before ","oh it's like and anything that space you say the astronauts with their oxygen tanks "
26359,210.3,Luis,,"student so can you tell me what other tools or equipment may have been used to discover water so oxygen tanks are used to help the scientists breathe it if they go out to space but what do you think they use to discover water ","and um well i'm i gotta admit i didn't really read this but i listened to the conversation and i heard myself and i heard lunar orbiter "
26361,150.1,Luis,,"okay sounds good was there a reason you were unable to read this passage or anything that i can assist you with ","i'm now i think i was probably just thinking about my own space and watching videos on youtube "
26363,150.1,Luis,,"okay sounds good well maybe next time we can try and read our passage first and then see if we can come back and spend some time on those extra tasks without sound okay so that we can make sure that we're fully in the conversation right ","uh huh okay "
26366,150.1,Oliver,,,"oh that's okay um i just actually needed to say that i looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of us i felt like you really gave each one of us attention and helped us understand our answers and the text even better so thank you so much "
26372,150.1,Luis,,,"i don't think i should be in this class i already know all about space "
26375,150.1,Luis,,"i'm going to go ahead and share the game plan with you for today and then maybe we can talk about why i felt like we should all be talking together in a small class to learn from each other does that sound okay ","yeah okay "
26382,150.1,Luis,,"can i get a thumbs up yeah yeah okay ","that's a good plan yeah "
26390,120.4,Chris,,"all right perfect so student can you go ahead and read your response to me ","yeah okay um so i wrote down that all scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
26392,230.1,Chris,,"great and what made you write that answer can you tell me a little bit little bit about that ","yeah our teacher told us to look for kind of the keyword so it's looking for scientists and finding and water on the moon and so that's how i found it in the first paragraph "
26398,120.2,Chris,,"So let's look at the question again, it says what equipment did scientists use discover water on the moon ","all okay oh wow oh what scientists used to find water "
26401,210.2,Chris,,"great so what is the question asking for are they asking for what was found on the moon or are they asking for what tools or equipment was used to find water on the moon what do you think ","what tools or equipment was us "
26404,410.2,Chris,,"and one thing that i'm concerned about is that maybe your response doesn't exactly answer the question ","well i mean i went to nasa so i know that um scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26411,120.4,Jazmin,,"let's hear what you class have been talking about ","i you don't understand why my answers wrong "
26415,120.4,Farrah,,"all right i'll be right here all right student and student how is it going what have you class been discussing ","well i was talking about that i i picked up a microscope because it had all the keywords and not section of all story and i was saying that um they had equipment and this was the only place where they were really talking about equipment and water "
26421,310.1,Oliver,,"okay well i think that it's great that you class have been looking for keywords when i was speaking with student he also he also mentioned the same thing and i think that that's a really great strategy ","oh well we both said equipment um well i said equipment to discover water on the moon umpretty much all of them "
26427,230.3,Oliver,,"which is a microscope correct ","yeah yeah yeah we talked about the microscope "
26432,210.2,Oliver,,"can either you class tell me what discover means ","i'm okay i know what discover means um i mean like when you're looking for something and on you will find it on but i also i just saw the clock and i just heard that it's time for us to go "
26434,210.2,Oliver,,,"bye "
26440,150.1,Luis,,"and after you have shared your answer with me i am going to have you listened to our other friends responses all right and i want you to think about their thinking as well as you're thinking yes student ","excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26443,150.1,Luis,,"well we are going to learn today after our conversation about ways in which all of us can improve our responses so even though we may know a lot about space there's still room for improvement for all of us and so that's why we've all been working together on the side all right student ","okay "
26449,230.1,Luis,,"all right student actually why don't we have you start off first so your response to our question was that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen things can you tell me what made you say that ","well they may say yes well i know they use a lot of equipment like in order to go to space they gotta breathe in breathe out oxygen tank so that's like good equipment "
26454,420.3,Luis,,"alright so while i go ahead and talk to my other friends i want you to look back into the passage and see if you can underline what equipment you read in the passage ","okay okay "
26457,230.1,Jazmin,,"okay perfect thank you alright student let's go on to you so you said that nasa sent a small machine so why did you choose to write about small machine can you tell me a little bit about that ","yeah i was looking for the answer and well in the second paragraph and when i saw machine i know that's like equipment and this one's talking about finding are looking for ice deposit so i figured that was it yeah i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26462,420.2,Jazmin,,"alright so think about adding some more details to your response based off what else is mentioned in passage to ","um so you're saying i just gotta find more details and then add them to my answer "
26466,120.4,Chris,,"thank you student alright student can you go ahead and read your response to me student ","yeah sure i said um scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
26470,230.2,Chris,,"great and what makes you say that where did you find that information ","in the first paragraph um yeah it's i took it right out of the text says all water can be found deep within the bones bone craters great and then i kind of put it in my own words "
26477,310.1,Chris,,"all right i appreciate you paraphrasing that and putting it into your own words ","for equipment the scientists use equipment that scientists use for water "
26483,150.1,Chris,,"does that make sense ","okay okay so you know as for for well for equipment i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26489,420.2,Oliver,,"response so i want you that can you tell me i know that in your answer you said you circle the same as student but can you put the answer to the question in your own words ","okay sure um so i say the answer is okay well i circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment you need as a microscope to look closely at the water "
26496,230.1,Oliver,,"can you tell me a little bit about what you were thinking when you really highlighted or underline the word microscope and included it in your response either one of you class can share yeah ","well i can share um okay so i was thinking you know um first off we have to find a piece of equipment and so i know when we're in science class the teacher is always like okay we're going to use some science department to base or remember what you have to do and what sometimes we have goggles and sometimes we use the microscope so when i saw that one i was like okay max definitely equipment and then um i was looking for a place on the story where they're talking about scientists using it and on them discovering water and ballpark right before it says the water they found is microscopic and finding is like discovering and so that's how i came up with i don't know if i sing for you student "
26498,120.4,Farrah,,"what do you think student do you want to share a little bit about your thoughts ","um well i guess yeah that's that's similar for me because i was looking for equipment and i saw the microscope and arm and i was looking for kind of the water on the moon part of it and i saw that in um in that paragraph three "
26502,310.1,Chris,,"great well i really appreciate how you class chose to look for a piece of equipment ","wasn't a question teacher i was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what i wanted to say thank you for asking me those questions about my answer and taking some time to kind of explain how my ideas were connected and how they were connected so now i have some ideas on how to make my answer better "
26505,310.1,Chris,,,"bye teacher "
26509,310.1,Luis,,,"oh yeah well actually i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26511,110.3,Luis,,"oh maybe you can help us a little bit as we think about the question i'm so glad that you already know a lot about space um do you want to share one thing with us ","what "
26513,110.3,Luis,,"do you want to share one thing with us that you know about space ","oh oh yes i do okay my favorite thing about space is how pluto it used to be a planet and then then they like kicked it out of being a planet because it was too small it's like poor pluto too small company "
26517,120.3,Oliver,,"so maybe um i wonder if student could you repeat the question back to us if you have it handy ","yeah okay right here on the question as what equipment that scientists use or discover water on the moon "
26521,210.4,Jazmin,,"so student maybe you can look at the text and tell us um what's the machine called that you were looking for i think it was in the maybe the second paragraph ","oh let me check okay so nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26523,110.4,Farrah,,"that's perfect thank you student so i think part of a great answer for us when we're thinking about what's the equipment that the scientists use is exactly what student just said she called it a lunar orbiter do you have a question student or maybe something you want to add ","yeah well um i said i said that the answer was that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26528,210.4,Luis,,"does class want to tell me what they think the word microscopic means like what comes to your mind when you hear the word microscopic ","i got this one i got this one "
26530,210.4,Luis,,,"yeah okay microscopic means so so so small "
26534,210.4,Oliver,,"and so has class here ever seen or used a microscope before ","oh yeah we all use them in science class "
26536,210.4,Chris,,"awesome student do you want to tell me like what can you do when you use a microscope ","well you can you can see things that you couldn't really see without it you can see bacteria and cells "
26539,210.4,Chris,,"yeah that's awesome thanks student i always think it's kind of fun to consider the fact that like we use our eyes to see everything around us but there's so much more in this universe that we can't see without a microscope it's pretty incredible to think about ","also oh can i add one thing "
26541,210.4,Chris,,,"well okay well it's just that i i went to nasa actually and i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like the oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26544,110.1,Luis,,"someone mentioned oxygen tanks in their answer ","that was me that was me i also had that same idea "
26546,230.1,Luis,,"yeah so why do you think that scientists at nasa might want to use something like an oxygen tank when they're going to do their work on the moon ","well without oxygen tanks they wouldn't be able to breathe out in space they couldn't do anything without the oxygen tanks they'd just die "
26549,130.1,Jazmin,,"so i think the three that we've identified so far all together will will lead us to a great answer and i think specifically when we look at the text two have those specific pieces of equipment are mentioned explicitly in the text student do you want to say something ","yeah well that was that was gonna be my question because i mean i picked the small machine and and i understand also microscope is in there but i don't think i would have thought to put oxygen tanks because it's not really in the story so am i wrong if i don't say that "
26554,420.2,Oliver,,"Because by looking at what you found in the text, you have answered the question correctly, so we can always update our answers, and we can add more information that we hear our classmates sharing. ","well i'm i'm i'm really sorry about this i just looked at the clock i'm actually we are we have to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for letting us know how important our our knowledge is and the things we know and how there's more than one right answer to this question it was really great to learn that with you today "
26560,420.2,Luis,,,"i'm good excuse me i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26567,120.2,Jazmin,,"the first question i saw was what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah i said nasa sent a small machine "
26571,120.4,Farrah,,"yeah and then i also noticed that student and student you class took a similar approach when you are looking at the text because i i think you class used a different word maybe student do you mind telling us what you mentioned for your answer ","yeah i said microscope was the equipment "
26573,120.4,Oliver,,"student you said the same thing ","yeah i think the microscope was the equipment they used "
26579,120.4,Luis,,"student i want to come back to you hun because you mentioned um some other things that you know that scientists might use on the moon do you want to tell us about what you think scientists may use on the moon ","yeah yeah so an important piece of equipment as an oxygen tank like they need those so they can breathe "
26582,120.4,Chris,,"student you mentioned what the scientists were doing on the moon do you want to tell us what the scientists were doing on the moon ","um so they're looking for water right and then they find water deep in these craters so like they found a whole bunch of craters with a whole lot of water "
26584,120.4,Jazmin,,"yeah student do you have something to add ","but i guess i don't understand why my answers wrong "
26588,120.3,Jazmin,,"student do you mind reading that first sentence out loud ","nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26595,230.3,Chris,,"so that's called our lunar orbiter so we can include that in our answer and then i also liked what student and student mentioned about the microscope as another piece of equipment another tool that the scientists use so go ahead student ","to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks "
26601,230.2,Oliver,,"student maybe you can tell us can you tell us where in the text you found that word microscope ","yeah that was in paragraph three "
26603,120.3,Luis,,"okay great um student do you want to read that paragraph three for us maybe just focusing on the last sentence there ","you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26610,210.4,Oliver,,"student that sounds like a little bit of your answer what do you class think that lunar orbiter was doing on the moon ","looks like it's looking for deposit yeah i'm sorry teacher but it's time for us to go. "
26612,210.4,Jazmin,,,"bye "
26618,150.1,Luis,,"so maybe if we kind of glue all of this together we can come up with a clear answer so can you raise your hand if you said no that the water on the moon is not valuable ","teacher okay i think i got this all figured out now so i'm all good "
26622,110.1,Luis,,"oh okay um so maybe could you hold off for one sec student ","okay "
26625,120.4,Luis,,"well first of all can you tell us what you said what can we do with that water ","i said that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen "
26628,230.3,Luis,,"yeah and so i think that if we consider that this this water might not be ready yet like student and student said what might happen in the future is what student just said ","yeah it's in paragraph five "
26631,210.4,Luis,,"yeah great and so i saw that as well what student do you think that according to the text astronauts might be able to do with the hydrogen and the oxygen ","okay well i know that we can breathe oxygen and so they could breathe it oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel yeah so rocket fuel "
26634,110.4,Farrah,,"i think that student just identified one of the reasons why water on the moon might be a valuable resource in the future ","yeah well i'm still kind of confused "
26637,230.1,Farrah,,"still kind of confused okay well let's keep thinking through this um is there anything in particular that's confusing you right now student ","well because if luis's right then that will mean that i'm wrong but i think that i think that i i came up with a good answer based on the text too "
26639,230.1,Farrah,,"yeah and so maybe you can clarify your thinking for us a little bit why do you think that maybe they're not ready to use the water yet ","okay because they talked about how like it costs a lot of money and it'll take a lot of time which means that it's going to be a long time before you can do anything with it "
26647,230.3,Chris,,"about how heavy water is and the need to carry water on the ships to to the moon and other locations in our universe ","own oh yeah okay in paragraph four it says for example was this it could be useful lots of ways for example future astronauts could drink this water water is heavy it takes up a lot of romana spacecraft having water available in the moment me more room on the spacecraft thing "
26653,120.2,Chris,,"yeah maybe we can glue all of these ideas together and come back to this question is there convincing evidence that water could be water on the moon could be valuable ","When you were talking about the future, I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024. "
26658,150.1,Oliver,,"and now thinking about like if we do make it back to the moon and we're looking for water might it be valuable for our future scientists student go ahead yeah ","i see that it's almost time for us to go but i am thinking now okay so like it's not ready yet but i'm like student said like maybe by 2024 if they build a base on the moon then they could not have to carry the water there by 2024 and then it would be valuable "
26662,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah that's exactly right that's what i'm thinking to face is pretty incredible so we'll have to wait and find out what these scientists come up with ","well i want to say teacher thank you for when you you asked us all so many questions to try and find out what what we're thinking and i tell you like you know when you were telling me that my idea was still a good idea so thank you for that "
26668,120.3,Luis,,"water on the moon i want us to take a look though back at the question that was being asked and i want us to think about oh yes student ","um yeah excuse me um i shouldn't be in this class already know all about space "
26672,120.3,Jazmin,,"now we're going to look at back at the question to think about what is this question asking so can class read for me the question that we need to answer ","okay so the question is what equipment that scientists to use to discover water on the moon "
26675,420.1,Farrah,,"what's a specific part of that question that we need to look at and think about ","i think an important part of the question is the part about equipment "
26679,230.2,Oliver,,"um so thinking about equipment that scientists use discover water on the moon um does class have an idea of maybe which paragraph we might look to ","um yeah um i found my answer in paragraph three "
26681,230.2,Oliver,,"okay can you explain that a little bit and why you looked at paragraph three ","um yeah so paragraph three they were talking about a scientific tool it says that mo story and that's on microscope "
26683,210.4,Oliver,,"okay what did they use what did they say you need a microscope for can you find that in the text ","um yeah that says you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
26685,210.4,Oliver,,"oh ok so to look really closely at what ","i thought tiny teeny tiny water "
26689,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay okay so we have a microscope that we can look at to see the teeny tiny water ","i found some way different def i found my answer from paragraph two and i said nasa send a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26693,130.2,Chris,,"want to build off of either what Jazmin or Oliver said about the equipment remember there when but that scientists use Chris. ","well so for my answer i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon but it doesn't new equipment and my answer but that's how i answered the question "
26696,110.1,Jazmin,,"okay thank you thank you for sharing ","it says nasa such a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate "
26698,120.3,Jazmin,,"oh okay so can you keep going and read the next sentence ","is lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater "
26702,210.4,Oliver,,"what do we think of of what student just read so she said nasa send a small machine and what was the machine can class tell me ","okay so she found a machine was called the lunar orbiter "
26705,120.4,Chris,,"student what do you think ","well so i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26709,110.3,Farrah,,"yeah that's actually i love that you brought that background knowledge with you and we can definitely add that into our answer ","but what about the microscope "
26714,120.3,Farrah,,"what does it say on paragraph three about the microscope um can class start reading with the sentence that says the second sentence and paragraph three student ","can i read it okay the second sentence mm hmm the water they found is microscopic meaning you wouldn't be able to see it if you were looking straight at it "
26717,210.4,Farrah,,"so i guess they were investigating right with the equipment and they help the microscope the microscope also help them look closely ","oh umso like they're both the answer "
26721,130.2,Oliver,,"um what do you what do you all think ","um well actually i was just gonna say that i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go and i'll watch but i just wanted to say thank you so much for helping us find that important part of the question because that helps our discussion really help us get to the answer so thank you so much "
26724,130.2,Chris,,,"hi teacher "
26727,150.1,Luis,,"now that all of you have shared your responses i'd like for you to sit face to face and have a class discussion of your responses to see whether or not you class can figure out like which yeah of course student ","excuse me teacher but i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space i guess so ok class i'll be the reporter "
26738,220.1,Farrah,,"and the timing starts now ","okay so student do you want to change your answer or student you want to change your answer now i think my answer is great because i i talked about some equipment so i don't even know why i'm in this class i think my answers okay oh let me see yeah i talked about the craters full of water oh so and that's in the story and we were supposed to pull stuff out of the text so oh i think it's fine well i mean i think the mine is right i got my mind was right and we can't all be right because your answer it's very different student and then even we had equipment but you were talking about oxygen tanks and and i'm just talking about the that small machine that they put on the moon okay so uh we have the same answer so i guess i'm not sure why our answer will be wrong cuz it is equipment ya ya it is equipment let me see cuz when i looked in the story yeah we're talking about equipment that's on the moon uh used to find the water and they used a microscope to look at the water so i mean that sounds like the same thing i mean i don't know let me ask the teacher um teacher student and i don't know why our answer is wrong because we think that we we are right "
26740,110.1,Jazmin,,"cool and you class are just on time ","good yeah i don't know why my answers wrong too "
26752,230.1,Farrah,,"To look really closely is connected to discovering water. ","oh well okay so when you're like looking for water you know and then you gotta look at it once you find it and what how is looking okay well i guess looking at the water is looking for the water oh uh huh oh yeah okay student i see what you're saying um okay oh so if you're looking at the water you're looking for okay yeah okay nevermind those are two different things i i i didn't think about that "
26754,420.1,Oliver,,"so you can follow that thread to the correct response. ","okay "
26758,150.1,Chris,,"you class have any more questions ","yeah i had that equipment i said on oxygen tanks in my answer um well okay my question because we were talking about equipment right because student and student had equipment but i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26761,150.1,Luis,,,"um okay it's asking us what equipment that scientists used to discover water on the moon well i mean like they need oxygen tanks to breathe on the moon so ah why is that wrong "
26769,150.1,Jazmin,,,"okay i guess i didn't really read it before because i felt like i already knew the answer Okay well so me and Luis have different types of equipment, and so I feel like when you were telling them to look it over I looked at over again, and I still feel like my answer is the right one. "
26774,150.1,Jazmin,,,"oh okay well let's see nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter okay um yeah i could say nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
26778,510.1,Oliver,,"yeah exactly you could specify the small machine and that's a strategy you can use in response questions ","oh okay well that's easy i can just add that um yeah teacher i'm sorry to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to lunch um so thanks for everything will see you later okay "
26781,520.1,Luis,,"hi welcome back from lunch so we'll just pick up from where we left it student as we talked about earlier in the day maybe in the future you can use specifying techniques in your responses ","um okay so i think i got this all figured out so i'm all good "
26783,110.3,Luis,,"um how about you just maybe stay with us as a mentor or a specialist ","specialist okay okay i guess i could do that "
26786,110.3,Jazmin,,,"okay so i added this specific word to my answer so now is it right the nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter yeah "
26788,110.4,Jazmin,,"yeah absolutely you're right um nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to discover water and that's your answer right there good job ","oh wait i have to add that part to this to discover water "
26792,150.1,Jazmin,,"well that makes the response more complete i guess in a way ","oh well cuz you told me that at the name of it so i just added the name of it i didn't add anymore after that "
26798,510.1,Jazmin,,"well in this case adding a name would be sufficient but i i'm talking more about a strategy of specifying your responses instead of just like adding a name into it ","So I guess cuz I was thinking when you say. to specify i'm doesn't that mean just saying what the name of the equipment is so how come you added okay i guess what i don't understand is how come you added more you added the discover discover water part to the answer "
26803,150.1,Jazmin,,"you you you could always just jot down the information in the text to support a full response so that's how you do that ","okay yeah cuz i'm still kind of confused so i guess i'll just ask you after okay "
26808,110.1,Chris,,"yeah thank you so much student ","so i know that jazmin's answer was the right one um that you um nasa sent a small machine called the lunar orbiter uh to discover water um so i guess i'm trying to think about why where i went wrong in mine um because i didn't put any of that stuff in my in my answer "
26813,310.1,Chris,,"um i really appreciate your active reflection and self regulation ","well because it says it in the story it says that um let me see where was that scientists have found evidence that water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so um so if something is found deep that means that it has to be like you know like in the pool when you go and you swim in the pool and you go in the deep end and there's like a lot more water on the deep side of the pool then on the shallow side "
26826,210.4,Chris,,"yeah then that's pretty cool it's a some solid individual independent thinking and then how do you think you could locate that the textual evidence that student found in the text ","oh okay yeah i was trying to figure out why student tools out when because i was using the words from the from the question in my answer you know like i was looking for discover and i didn't see discover in the text so then i was thinking okay what's like discover like finding something so then i was looking for to find in the text and i only saw it in two parts in the first part and in the third part on that's where class came from and i knew it wasn't the one that i'm no offense student and student but i knew it wasn't the third part cuz um it was supposed to be like a lot of water in order to find it and that they said you couldn't even see that water so i guess i don't see like discover or find a in the second part where student got her answer so i don't know i don't know how you got that answer student Oh. investigate oh yeah i guess so like like on um on the tv show sometimes they have like a like an investigator who goes to get some information "
26830,210.4,Chris,,,"Oh yeah yeah. okay yeah "
26833,420.2,Oliver,,"so i think you're on a good track but if you look at the passage too you can find the word investigate ","um you know what teacher i i had read that there will be a base on the moon by 2024 "
26835,420.2,Oliver,,,"so maybe we'd be able to drink water then by 2024 that's pretty close "
26838,140.1,Oliver,,"but you'd have to be a scientist to figure out how to do that student ","oh yeah and i'm not a scientist i'm i'm just a student "
26842,140.1,Chris,,"well you could be ","oh oh man yeah maybe i could be when i when i'm old i just looked at the clock and it's actually time for us to go to our next class but i wanted to say i'm all thank you for helping us to think about what strategy that we use to get to our answer because um i guess listening to how you were talking to student and and student yeah actually i appreciated that too because i i thought i use the a good strategy but you kind of explained on how i need to think about what some of the words mean and so i think that might give me some ideas on improving my answer "
26847,140.1,Farrah,,,"we'll we'll see you next time teacher bye hi hello can you can you see us or hear us "
26850,150.1,Luis,,"hi student high student hi student hi student hi student so do you class want to talk about the feedback um know your responses for the question ","um yeah this is student i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26852,110.3,Luis,,"well student if that's the case um you can stay and help the rest of us to understand better about this space is that all right ","yeah yeah i'd love to hear that "
26854,110.3,Farrah,,,"would you like us to to share our responses "
26859,120.4,Oliver,,"do you want to start ","yeah yeah okay i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely um yeah i circled the same the same as student "
26861,110.1,Chris,,"mm hmm ","my answer is that i'm okay it's "
26865,110.1,Jazmin,,"mm hmm ","that scientists found craters full of water on the moon i said that nasa sent a small machine "
26867,110.1,Luis,,"they did yeah ","okay my answer as that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
26874,130.3,Chris,,"you're absolutely right that there's water on the moon inside of the craters but if you look closely in the text you could see that um these are very small pieces of water instead of full of water ","well craters craters are really big "
26878,130.3,Chris,,"um it's true that create crater is a big but the water molecules they found is microscopic ","okay "
26882,130.3,Jazmin,,,"yeah "
26887,130.3,Farrah,,"so basicallyNASA sent this small piece of machine called lunar orbiter to find the water, so the part of finding the water is actually quite important to the to the text. ","um excuse me this is student i i don't understand why my answers are wrong "
26893,150.1,Farrah,,"does that answer questions the one ","um how can how can you find something that's too small to see don't need a microscope "
26898,120.2,Chris,,"we are but we are investigating what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon ","well hi this is student i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26902,230.2,Chris,,"so student do you see oxygen tanks in this text ","huh oh no no they don't talk about that in the story "
26907,150.1,Luis,,"and student that i believe that kind of answers your question right ","um yeah but if there are scientists like astronauts on the moon they are definitely 100 using oxygen tanks "
26911,150.1,Luis,,"is that all right. ","yeah yeah okay yeah so it's sounding like that aorbiter thing is the answer "
26916,130.1,Oliver,,"um yeah if you if you include both of them in your answer that would be better ","um this is student um i just i just looked at the clock and unfortunately it's it's time for us to go to lunch right now but thank you so much for really helping us use evidence from the text and our answers that's going to be really helpful next time "
26920,230.1,Luis,,"student i think your answer is quite interesting can you explain a little bit ","oh excuse me excuse me "
26925,230.2,Luis,,"why did you give us this answer where do you find it in the text ","yeah i think i think i think student has something to say though um and and i'll answer maybe after him um yeah okay um i i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26928,110.3,Luis,,"oh student you know a lot of our space ","yep that sounds great "
26930,110.3,Farrah,,,"okay okay student i guess that's my turn now okay so i found my answer um in part three that's where i found it and it says you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so that's where i found it in the text "
26933,120.3,Farrah,,"is actually showing the text but student i want you to read the question more closely so what does the question ask us ","okay it says what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon "
26937,120.1,Farrah,,"So and so I think you can get a better answer to something related to discover water. ","okay "
26939,120.1,Farrah,,,"what should i do next "
26942,120.3,Jazmin,,"i want you to read closely about the paragraphs the second paragraph ","yes i had a different answer "
26944,120.3,Jazmin,,,"yes and so i said that nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26949,230.2,Jazmin,,"so i'm wondering why you say why you locate your answer at the second paragraph what evidence do you use to your answer ","okay yeah so i think my evidence is the first sentence in paragraph two where it says nasa sent a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and i would say that that's my evidence "
26953,210.4,Jazmin,,"okay good so um can you tell me like what is lunar orbiter ","yes i can okay a lunar orbiter it sounds like so it sounds like it investigates so that means it kind of looks for and locates where is the water on the moon "
26956,230.2,Jazmin,,"so actually and where did you find this answer ","in part two "
26958,230.2,Jazmin,,"yeah yeah just in the following sentence right ","yeah exactly "
26962,420.2,Chris,,"The following sentence just explain what was the what is lunar orbiter and what is for. So yeah Jamines, I think your answer and if your answer can be more specific to the name of the machine and your answer qould be perfect. Yes, Chris. ","yeah so i wanted to say um i i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they actually use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
26969,520.1,Chris,,"So the next time when you answer this questions so be sure to look for your information, your answers in the text. ","ok "
26972,520.1,Chris,,,"oh i was just gonna say that makes a lot of sense i understand i need to find equipment in the story right "
26975,110.1,Oliver,,"yeah yeah right ","um excuse me i'm i'm really sorry i don't want to interrupt but actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you so much for helping us look really specifically in the text and making sure that we had evidence for our answers i know that that's going to be really helpful for questions like this next time "
26978,150.1,Luis,,"hi class so i'm mr z and you class are going to work with me today to work with the text about a moon is a desert and we're going to go through the reading together and all here to answer any questions yes ","um yeah mr see i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
26985,210.4,Farrah,,"what is a microscope and what does it do for us ","okay so a microscope it's something you look through and when you look through it it makes really tiny things on so you can see that "
26987,210.4,Farrah,,"and oliveron when adept when we were using the microscope what the scientists want to fight ","oh so they wanted to find the water which was really actually like really tiny pieces of ice "
26990,210.4,Chris,,"good good and harry can you tell me what was that machine that small machine that they used to find the water ","oh "
26992,210.4,Jazmin,,,"and so that was actually my answer to nasa send a small machine and i found it in paragraph two and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
26996,210.4,Jazmin,,"oh you're so well what does that small machine do can class look at paragraph two and tell me what is that small machine do ","well i'm paragraph to it says it looks for ice in the polar craters "
26999,210.4,Oliver,,"hmm very good and why can't the machine just see the ice because what what was what was a what was what do they need more so just to ask her jazmin's question yes there ","oh wait so you said why couldn't they see the ice i was gonna say because it was too small that's why they need a microscope "
27002,210.4,Chris,,"and unless add on a little bit more about this water that they found on the moon so where is this water that they what kind of place do you find this water is in in a very like right place yes hairs ","on the crators and i think it says the really dark like the sun never shines there "
27006,210.4,Jazmin,,"yes very good why is it important that is in a dark place what would happen if it was in a place where the sun is shining what could happen ","well if the sun was shining maybe the ice would not kind of like kind of like global warming "
27009,210.4,Jazmin,,"yes very good and in the ice kind of melted you think the scientists that see can find the water ","probably not because i think it would melt and then probably a very "
27011,110.2,Farrah,,"Very good, so again just I think your answer was right, but we just we were just trying to see if the if the scientists could see it so again it wasn't that your answer is wrong ","week so it's the right answer the lunar orbiter or it's the right answer microscope "
27014,130.3,Farrah,,"well it could be both because you need the lunar orbiter to investigate ","oh well the microscope "
27016,110.1,Farrah,,"yes very good so again it would be but ","oh oh i thought you could only have one answer "
27018,120.4,Chris,,"yeah yes student you want to add to that ","yeah so um well actually i know that scientists they actually use a lot of equipment on like oxygen tanks and masks and suits because i went to nasa so i know they use a lot of equipment "
27020,110.2,Chris,,"very good yes scientists do use a lot of equipment so again this is why it doesn't have to be one answer it says what kind of equipment that they use so if you feel that all of these kind of equipment is a part of discovering water and it's all are the answer ","oh whoo so we so my answer could be on that the scientists to use the masks and the oxygen tanks and this be suits and the lunar orbiter and the microscope "
27025,210.4,Chris,,"endless space suit in in the reading do we see that there are some slots on the moon and they're investigating it ","oh i guess it doesn't really talk about astronauts in the story "
27028,210.4,Luis,,"um yeah i don't think there's astronauts in the story so far ","oh yeah so i think it's a custom lunar orbiter it's actually like a type of a robot and it doesn't even need people to go on it and so there weren't even really people like a string that's on the moon they just like sent the lunar orbiter and it went around and and it found the water "
27030,110.4,Oliver,,"yes very good that's a good answer the lunar orbiter is a little robot they used to investigate but if there was people in and they needed to to drive the orbit or maybe they would be an astronaut yes ","well actually i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch now but before we go i wanted to say thank you so much for being so welcoming of all of our answers and helping us see that we didn't have to just pick one that there was room for more than one idea thank you so much "
27034,150.1,Luis,,"just from hearing just from hearing your responses i've i've been enlightened and i've been thinking about this question and what it's really asking okay um so i've heard so i'm going to review your responses out loud this is what i've heard ","excuse me "
27037,150.1,Luis,,,"hi yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27039,150.1,Luis,,"oh okay wait so sorry you said you shouldn't be in this class because you know all about space ","sure do "
27050,110.1,Luis,,"and student you said scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks ","yep definitely true "
27059,210.3,Farrah,,"i'm going to give you a few seconds to kind of think about that all right and then we're going to go around and talk about it ","so the reason that i picked the microscope is because it says it there in part three it says the water they found is microscopic so you'd need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and so it's right there in the story so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27064,210.2,Farrah,,"What equipment is used right? ","a microscope. "
27069,310.1,Jazmin,,"And you looked at the sentence that said microscopic and thought , oh microscope. Ok? Great job. ","yeah so my answer is nasa sent a small machine and that also it's right in the text at the beginning of part two "
27072,230.3,Jazmin,,"that is true right so it's similar to kind of farrah's thinking as well right ","A machine. "
27077,110.1,Chris,,"okay good job student ","ok well so actually i went to nasa so i know that astronauts and scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27079,230.2,Chris,,"oh that's all true right so you used your personal experience right to know and you saw with your own eyes what they're using right um can i ask did they did you see the ma any of what you saw mentioned in the text ","no they aren't in the story "
27082,210.2,Chris,,"okay they're not in the story okay so this is a good this is a really good point too um so whenever they ask a question right ","Oh, so the part the circle part because I guess I don't have anything to circle when I talk about the oxygen tanks. "
27089,110.3,Farrah,,"yeah yes that's yes that's right so you've got it student so that's now if the question had asked about your personal experience then you could mention what you had seen at nasa that would be very interesting for sure ok ","um yeah well actually it's not really a question but i just looked at the clock and we actually have to go to lunch now but i wanted to say thank you very much for helping us see oh yeah you really helped us see how our answers were part of the way there instead of all of the way there and that really got me thinking about how to use the story to make my answer even better so thank you so much "
27092,110.3,Farrah,,,"hi how are you "
27094,110.3,Farrah,,,"oh it's great we're really excited to work with you "
27097,150.1,Luis,,"have you class read the test i did you ","um yeah so we read it we read about the water on the moon and i'm thinking i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27100,140.1,Luis,,"fantastic how do you get that knowledge or how do you know about space ","oh i watch a lot of videos on youtube and sometimes i read articles like in magazines and i have this book with all these pictures of space oh i really like space "
27105,150.1,Luis,,"you were a lot about space right ","yeah so about the equipment i was thinking that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks "
27108,230.2,Luis,,"oxygen tank how do you get that from text ","on say well sorry yeah so i was thinking if there's scientists on the moon they are going to need oxygen tanks if they're gonna be looking around for a water "
27111,130.2,Farrah,,"does class has some different ideas to add them ","um yes i i thought something different so i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27113,230.1,Farrah,,"a microscope interesting can you talk more about why to send it to use microscope to look at what ","so it said that the water well actually it's ice it's really really small and you can't see it if you don't have a microscope "
27118,130.2,Jazmin,,"does class have more to add on to this question ","yeah "
27120,130.2,Jazmin,,,"so i said that nasa sent a small machine "
27126,210.4,Jazmin,,"a small machine washing machine with that machine called ","let me check okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter oh no i think you're frozen i can't see and hear you anymore oh you're back okay thank you so i just said it's called the lunar orbiter i found that in the second paragraph "
27128,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah you do really great job so the second paragraph is there's no standard small machine on lunar orbiter to investigate and what does the lunar orbiter fine ","well i guess it finds and that i in the craters "
27132,230.2,Chris,,"someone mentioned is that scientist need an oxygen tanks can you find the oxygen tank in zoos test can class tell me about please ","yeah well okay so i know student talked about the oxygen tanks before and i was thinking something similar of actually because i went to nasa so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and also masks and suits "
27136,230.3,Jazmin,,"so you think the side is the need also need oxygen tank mask and suit right ","i'm "
27138,230.3,Jazmin,,,"so harris and i know you like when nasa but it doesn't even say anything about oxygen tanks in the story so is that really a right answer "
27147,230.2,Chris,,"does this mention ","can i guess not so so you're saying that the answer it has to be in the story "
27156,120.3,Oliver,,"can we look at test again and ","excuse me on i'm so sorry i really don't want to interrupt but i just looked at the clock and we actually we have to go to lunch right now but i just wanted to say thank you so much because you really listened to everything we had to say but you also reminded us that we really needed to use that text and our answer and that is really really helpful so thank you so much "
27161,120.3,Farrah,,,"oh we're good we're so excited to work with you "
27163,120.2,Luis,,"awesome so i noticed that we answered the question what equipment did scientists use to discover water on the moon and all of you had great responses yes student ","um yeah i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27166,110.3,Luis,,"awesome i'm so excited that you know about space therefore you can share your knowledge with the class and help us grow ","awesome alright "
27170,210.2,Jazmin,,"when you hear the word equipment what comes to mind student ","i would say when you hear the word equipment it makes me think of a tool "
27173,110.1,Farrah,,"a tool ","i'm like something something you use to do something "
27182,120.2,Oliver,,"so what equipment is sciences us to discover water on the moon ","can you "
27184,310.1,Oliver,,"Of course I love that you advocated for yourself in that way ","oh okay that means that the astronauts they couldn't do it like just with themselves they needed something like a machine or a tool to help them do it "
27188,210.4,Chris,,"yeah so how did i get the water student ","on me i'm not sure how but i know that they found it in the craters "
27192,210.3,Chris,,"so this finding equator are saying that they found the quakers answer the contexts are connects back to the context of the question ","i guess because we have to talk about equipment right "
27194,230.1,Chris,,"why do you say that ","well because we've been talking about equipment "
27196,210.4,Jazmin,,"so we know that the scientists used equipment so now i want us to think about our responses yet but student ","and i was just gonna ask about my response actually so my response was nasa said just small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27199,210.3,Jazmin,,"okay what we're going to do we know that so thinking back to the context of the problem it says what equipment does a small machine connect back to the context of the problem does it tell us exactly what type of machine they use ","i got it right from the text in part two it says nasa send a small machine "
27205,120.4,Luis,,"awesome we're gonna come back together student what did you learn from jazmin's response ","um so student it does connect to the context of that question because while she talks about nasa and she found my machine and last door "
27207,120.4,Chris,,"awesome okay student what did you talk about ","okay well i was just telling student and of how i went to nasa and so i know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27213,130.2,Farrah,,"student do you agree that nasa use a small machine ","well yeah i mean student showed it to us and told us it was in the story but i still don't know why i should pick that and not the microscope "
27215,230.1,Farrah,,"okay what do you think about that why do you say the microscope share your knowledge with the class ","okay well in part three it says that the water they found was microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope "
27218,210.4,Farrah,,"it is it's all so you're onto something but what does microscopic mean ","i think it means really really small "
27223,210.3,Oliver,,"so with that being said they need the you say you need a scientific to call a microscope to look really closely but then does that help us yep does ","um i'm so sorry i just looked at the clock and we have to go to lunch i wish we could stay i'm really having a rough time um but i wanted to say before we go to lunch thank you so much for reminding us to think about the context of the question that is a really really helpful reminder for this question but also for other questions next time so thank you so much "
27226,210.3,Farrah,,,"hello hi "
27230,110.1,Farrah,,"that you thought that they need a scientific tool called microscopes look really closely ","yeah yeah that's what i said "
27232,210.3,Farrah,,"okay so for that how would they get the microscope to the moon ","oh oh i'm not sure i guess on the spaceship probably "
27234,210.3,Luis,,,"um yeah um i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27236,230.1,Luis,,"so can you tell me a little bit more about your response ","um yeah okay so i said scientists use a lot of equipment like i'm oxygen tanks because if there's astronauts on the moon and are looking for this water they definitely are using oxygen tanks "
27242,120.1,Luis,,"do you want to try to think about what else they could use ","um i saw something that's in the story "
27244,120.1,Luis,,,"oh i probably need to look at that again "
27246,120.1,Luis,,,"okay so they say small machine and they say microscope and those are both the equipment "
27249,210.3,Luis,,"so what is the small machine called ","lunar orbiter yep "
27251,210.3,Luis,,"do you think that's what they used to discover water on the moon ","um i mean it sounds like something that could be kind of useful because it says loner and i know that that means moon "
27253,210.3,Jazmin,,,"so that was my answer my answer was nasa sent a small machine so i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27257,210.4,Jazmin,,"so you had the right answer about a small machine but then after they find the they found the ice deposits they had to use something else to like look at it more closely ","oh is that what student was talking about "
27262,130.1,Farrah,,"so you both had part of the answer you said to put it together ","um so i'm wondering i the reason i picked a microscope instead of the machine is because how can you discover something if it's too small to see "
27265,210.4,Farrah,,"ice deposits in lunar craters but if it's too small to see with the eyes they have to go in with that microscope to try to find ","oh so i'm the machine it can do the finding even if it can't see it "
27267,210.4,Farrah,,"yeah that's what the microscopes for ","okay so um for the answer we just say both "
27271,130.1,Chris,,"yeah it would be both because you would need the two parts like the small machine when i began to investigate and i noticed ice deposits but since they were so small or to look at them they needed that needed a microscope look at it more closely ","yeah i have a comment so i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27273,110.3,Chris,,"yeah they do ","so could we put that in our answer too "
27276,130.3,Chris,,"not for this one only because it's about the equipment they used to discover the water they would use that equipment and other scenarios but this time it was just the mission and the microscope that we were looking for ","oh okay um why "
27282,410.2,Jazmin,,"but our answer has to use evidence from the text sure they might use that other equipment but in the text it didn't have anything about that ","okay okay that makes sense i have a question about the story so the story it doesn't say anything about astronauts going in the lunar orbiter so we're astronauts or do they just do the machine and it does all the work for them "
27284,210.4,Jazmin,,"yeah they actually send up the machine on its own to do the investigation so there's still on earth looking at what they're doing so the machine will go up there and discover the ice deposits and then they also have the microscope up there to help them look at it more closely ","so cool machine can do it all without any astronauts "
27286,210.4,Luis,,"so there's still people controlling it it's just from earth so they use computers and stuff to get it to do what it needs to do ","um yeah student it's like it's kind of like a robot right "
27288,110.1,Chris,,"yeah kind of ","my answer my answer is scientists found craters full of water on the moon is that ok "
27292,130.3,Oliver,,"so you just had what they found um so the equipment would be that small machine the lunar orbiter and then the microscope to look at it more closely student ","on i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you for helping us today i really appreciate how you helped us use evidence from the text in our answers and reminded us to really use the story and start off just what we knew thank you so much "
27296,150.1,Luis,,"so i put us to sit in this small class because i really liked you guys's answer but i wanted us to think more and think about what we read and try to reflect on our answers ","um yeah so i shouldn't be and that's class i already know all about space "
27300,110.3,Luis,,"and i would love to hear what you think about space ","okay yeah let me know when you want me to share "
27304,210.3,Jazmin,,"so student i know your answer was that they sent small machines but you know what those machines are called do you remember ","oh i think was in there okay it says nasa send a small machine called a lunar orbiter "
27306,210.3,Jazmin,,"exactly and do you remember what they do what do they look for ","they look for the water on the moon "
27309,120.4,Chris,,"thank you student what was your answer again ","okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27313,140.1,Chris,,"do you remember a cool fact that they mentioned ","i think they said the really dark "
27316,140.1,Chris,,"they they were yes that was mentioned it's where the sun never shines the ","ya there's no sun "
27318,140.1,Chris,,"yeah isn't that cool ","it's so cool "
27322,120.4,Oliver,,"so you said that you circle the same answer so vana what answer was that ","oh yeah we both said for the appointment we both said i'm microscope "
27324,210.3,Oliver,,"yeah do you remember what a microscope is used for ","yeah um a microscope it lets you look up things that are really really small like you can't see them um just in real life you have to look through the microscope to see them because they're so small "
27326,210.4,Oliver,,"exactly and do you remember in the article why they needed to use the microscope ","um yeah because well um because the water it's so small "
27328,110.1,Farrah,,"exactly yes student ","um i don't understand why our answer is wrong why is microscope wrong "
27334,210.1,Farrah,,"and that's how they discovered the war that's how they were able to see the water so your answer wasn't wrong you class had similar answers but i just wanted to know what you're thinking was when you came up with those answers ","oh oh okay yeah "
27336,230.1,Farrah,,"so why did you choose that ","i picked it because well i found it in part three in part three they say you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely "
27339,150.1,Farrah,,"exactly so that's how you know it was a good answer cuz you answered it ","okay so we're both right both me and student "
27342,130.1,Farrah,,"you and student ","oh yeah but i mean also student because she said something different "
27344,230.1,Jazmin,,"yeah student had the small machines student is that where you were referring to ","i was referring to the lunar orbiter yeah "
27347,230.3,Jazmin,,"yeah so student was her answer was a little different ","yeah you said they're both right "
27351,130.3,Jazmin,,"that was just something that was on the moon ","oh okay i don't know if i would have known that if you didn't tell me how "
27356,110.1,Jazmin,,"it was it no it was used to investigate ","thank you "
27358,130.1,Chris,,"one second student i will get right back to you and they use a microscope they use the lunar orbiter to investigate so there was a couple of different things yes student ","yeah well sort of about that i went to nasa so i know that scientists date to really use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27360,210.3,Chris,,"yeah they do so student student i know that you said that the scientists found craters full of water on the moon do you remember how they found them ","how they found them "
27363,210.3,Chris,,"yeah do you remember what they used to find them ","well i mean i'm student just said the machine and student set the microscope "
27366,120.4,Luis,,"student what was your answer ","oh um mine was kind of like what student just said i said scientists they use oxygen tanks "
27369,230.2,Luis,,"they did was that in the reading or was that just something you knew ","i i i don't yeah they didn't say oxygen tanks like in that story but i just know ever there are astronauts on the moon or anywhere in space they need oxygen tanks they definitely need that "
27376,120.1,Luis,,"remember something else ","ah i am i wasn't really paying attention "
27381,130.3,Oliver,,"so now you know two machines that they used in that they mentioned in the article ","that was easy um yeah i just looked up a clock and we have to go to lunch right now but i really appreciate that you took the time to listen to all of our answers on a really made it feel like you really care what each one of us has to say about the question thank you so much "
27384,130.3,Luis,,,"hi "
27386,130.3,Luis,,,"so i was just gonna say cuz i know that this class is to is to help people who are having some trouble with their answers but i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know about space "
27392,120.4,Farrah,,"student can you tell me what your answer was again ","yeah so basically what i said was that you need a scientific to have a microscope to look really close right "
27394,210.4,Farrah,,"so in the third paragraph it explains that you would need a microscope to look at the water that's um ","that's in the craters "
27398,210.4,Farrah,,"but is there another tool yeah find maybe in the second paragraph that um ","the last glass of water last measure "
27403,210.4,Farrah,,"is basically the amount of water that a person drinks a day ","so it's not a lot at all two ounces which "
27407,210.4,Farrah,,"at the bottom of the crater just that little bit whereas the lunar orbiter was sent to the moon to look at it all and investigate everything does that make sense ","so they're both the answers but "
27411,210.4,Jazmin,,"instead of just the water at the bottom ","i just had a quick question is i think my answer was pretty close to that and i know that again we're working together because our answers right i guess it was a little confused on what my answer was wrong "
27421,420.2,Jazmin,,"and you were right with that you weren't wrong but if you could go into more detail about it so in the reading it does explain what that machine was so just to make sure that you give more detail instead of just saying small machine ","explain what the small machine was called yeah so is this small machine is it yes it is good job i have to say the whole thing like i can't just say the small machine "
27423,410.2,Jazmin,,"right you need to be a little more specific so that they understand what you're talking about because i was looking at it and you said small machine and i might think you're talking about the microscope because the microscope isn't big it's small ","so you just want to really be specific about what you're what you're saying "
27428,410.2,Chris,,,"so i i went to nasa with my dad i mean we go a couple times a year to this dentist space center and i i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and shoot i was wondering like i didn't see that in the video and so i thought like isn't that may be an answer for the equipment that they use "
27432,410.2,Oliver,,,"then i wanted to thank you so much for working with us in with you can see thank you "
27436,410.2,Luis,,,"i'm yet so basically i think i finally got this all figured out so good now "
27442,120.4,Luis,,"okay do you want to go first ","yeah absolutely okay so my answer is that water can be split into two parts hydrogen and oxygen You remember, if you look Oh well, it's. yeah it's valuable well okay so it's valuable if you look back in the end they have all this stuff about how okay so you can use hydrogen and oxygen you can use let's see in paragraph five they say you can read the oxygen and oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket so that's really useful because you have rocket fuel that you can make like on the moon you don't have to take it with "
27451,210.4,Farrah,,"it's the same thing ","oh yeah so okay here's what i will see so i said no that would not be valuable time yeah i had basically i'm very similar answer but mine was mostly that it wasn't ready yet that you have to do stuff to the water to make it or first you have to find out how to get it like out of the craters and you got to figure out how to know and like all that you can't use it because it's not ready to use yet "
27456,130.2,Chris,,"and actually student had a good point and his answer student if you want to share ","my answer was water is heavyy so it's good they don't have to carry it in the ships which i think would be a really good like the if they didn't they don't need to have any more water they can just get it on the moon "
27460,210.4,Jazmin,,"right so once they can get the water they won't have to bring water bottles on to their spacecraft which will be nice because it takes up a lot of room and it's heavy so without that they can bring more things and they'll already have water provided student ","yeah i think you and i guess what i'm wondering is like student mustang like the water is heavy so they don't have they don't have to take it on the spaceship but if they don't have it on the spaceship what will they drink "
27464,210.4,Jazmin,,"well once they get to the moon they would drink the water on the moon so i mean ","how did they survive like when they're they're flying to the moon so "
27466,210.4,Jazmin,,"i'm sure that they bring maybe a water bottle each a little bit of water each but i think this is more saying they don't have to bring a whole thing of water because that's really happy but you do still need to drink water so i'm sure they bring ","a little bit each once they get to the moon there'll be enough provided for them to drink where they "
27468,210.4,Jazmin,,,"that makes a lot of sense "
27474,210.4,Oliver,,,"oh actually yeah i was just thinking to myself like well i read that they were going to make up my moon base by maybe on the moon and it made me think that maybe they can use the water to make the moon base possible like they could make oxygen and fuel for the moon "
27485,130.3,Jazmin,,"no so the final conclusion is that water is valuable right because it'll help with the fuel for the spacecraft and also help them make room in ","we just wanted to thank you for working with us and like one of the things that i really wanted to thank you for working with us is like how you helped us to verify what we were like saying like you helped us understand why did we come up with the answer and you also listen to ideas which really made me feel valued and i think that class had a really good time working with you class yeah i think class really enjoyed it so thank you so much it was really fun working with you thank you "
27487,130.3,Oliver,,,"oh hello "
27492,120.2,Luis,,"what equipment that scientists use to discover water on the moon ","yeah so i shouldn't be in this class i already know all about space "
27498,230.1,Luis,,"right okay so how did you find that out because i didn't see that in the text so how to use that ","okay well if there are astronauts on the moon looking for water i know that they would have to have oxygen tanks 100 "
27502,230.2,Farrah,,"right so what would we be looking at in the text what did it say that we would have to be looking at ","okay well we would be looking at the tiny oh what did they call them ice deposits "
27504,230.2,Oliver,,,"okay yeah "
27506,110.1,Oliver,,"okay so you said that you circled the same thing as student ","yeah we bought picked a microscope for the appointment "
27508,230.1,Oliver,,"okay and can you tell me a little bit more why you ","circle on yeah so while a microscope lots to see really tiny things on and if you see something you can discover it so that's why i picked a microscope because being able to see tiny particles but overall "
27510,210.4,Oliver,,"mm hmm right right and we would need a microscope to look at something we can't see with our own eyes right ","yeah yeah exactly "
27513,210.4,Jazmin,,,"um i have a different answer i said nasa sent a small machine and i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27516,210.4,Jazmin,,"well yours is correct but do you remember what the small machine was called in the text ","okay it says nasa centers for machine called a lunar orbiter "
27518,430.2,Jazmin,,"I mean it's not really specific so you don't really know exactly what machine, it is, but by saying what is the Lunar orbiter it just makes it more specific so, then you know what exactly it is. ","oh okay yeah "
27521,120.4,Chris,,"and then student do you remember what you said ","yeah i said that scientists found creators full of water on the moon "
27525,410.3,Chris,,"okay i'm gonna have to look further after but i'm in the paragraph it doesn't say was filled it just said that it was found in the craters so just to make sure you understand it wasn't like filled to the top it was just at the bottom they found some water and some of them so that's how they found out there that there was water on the moon ","oh okay i guess because we just kind of picture that wrong in my brain "
27528,150.1,Farrah,,"so not a problem um does class have any other questions about it ","i'm i'm still kind of confused "
27531,230.1,Farrah,,"on what ","oh well so you said that jazmin's answer was right but what about the microscope "
27538,210.4,Farrah,,"towards the end they were saying that they used a microscope to really look at the ","oh ok so we were both right "
27541,110.2,Chris,,"yes yep you are ","oh well i just wanted to share that i went to nasa and so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27544,110.3,Chris,,"yeah no exactly and that was really good that student brought up that they use on oxygen tanks because it didn't say it in the text but in order to be out in space you would need an oxygen tank ","so i could put that for my answer "
27546,110.3,Chris,,,"oh so i'm like equipment that was in the story "
27550,230.3,Chris,,"yeah so like how he said i'm phase microscopes they use the lunar orbiter and then student said that he knew using his background knowledge that you also need an oxygen tank out there so that's why yeah ","yeah okay okay so you just want to say one thing from the story and then you could say some stuff you know too "
27555,230.3,Oliver,,,"um so i just looked at the clock and actually um we have to go to lunch now what i just wanted to say thank you so much for really listening to each one of our answers and helping us understand how they have different machines worked in space that was a really really helpful thank you "
27559,230.3,Oliver,,,"we are excited to work with you "
27562,120.3,Luis,,"good cool all right so we just read this short excerpt about discovering water on the moon and so our first question can i was wondering if someone can remind me student you look really excited to answer so if you could please reread the question for us ","oh yeah i can but i just wanted to say before i read anything that i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know like everything there is to know about space "
27564,110.3,Luis,,"well that's actually really good that you say that student so since you actually know a lot about space hopefully you can help us in our peers get to the final answer how does that sound ","yeah i guess i can i can do that "
27566,120.3,Luis,,"alright cool that sounds good alright so let's jump back into that first part do you mind repeating the question for us ","um okay so the question was um what equipment it scientists used to discover water on the moon "
27573,420.1,Jazmin,,"So what i'm suggesting that we should do in order to get to the answer is that we look for some keywords keywords or some context clues that will help us find find it in the question. Jazmin, you have a question? ","i was just wondering why my answer was wrong "
27578,420.1,Chris,,"what are some keywords or some context clues that will help us get to the answer so what's the main part of the question what are we looking for in the question ","so we're looking for we're looking for equipment what did they use "
27583,130.2,Farrah,,"good good student you want to build off that ","reach every reader oh i just got the same thing to say that also it was easy to find water "
27585,130.2,Luis,,,"um is it like tools you know like it's kind of like a tool that you use "
27588,210.3,Jazmin,,"good yep so that's one word tool that's one that we could use student you have a different one ","i'm just thinking that anytime that you're like making something or or taking in something like i will look for words like making or building or taking like you have to use equipment if you are doing those things "
27592,210.2,Oliver,,"okay so how about i build off that again so what are we looking for with the equipment that we're using ","so what we're looking for is we're looking for the the water so that we know that there's water and we're trying to find it "
27596,130.2,Chris,,"right good good class have a different answer ","um i guess the only difference that i would add to the answer is i would add that you might be looking more for ice than actual water because it's ice on the "
27602,210.4,Chris,,"right yeah because it's cold so good good so these are all great clues that we all help on fighting together ","well i was just it was going through my head because we were talking about the different tools and what news define things and i i know cuz i've been to nasa like data few times that you know like astronauts have to wear spacesuits and like they have oxygen tanks and stuff so i was wondering if like well i guess i was wondering are those tools also "
27610,210.4,Farrah,,"and what i want you class to do is using what we just discovered from the question reread paragraph two and see if we can find an answer okay so let's take about one to two minutes to do that and so student have a question before we get started ","you have to go to our next class but thank you so much it was really interesting to meet you mr t and to talk to you thank you so much "
27631,120.3,Luis,,"alright class so let's jump back into where we left off and have you class in your groups you class can continue talking and just reread paragraph two okay ","all right okay so let's take a look at their craft and see if there's anything that are like clues that we can use okay so um alright so let's read it together okay nasa send a small machine called lunar orbiter just a very small so what do you think student is there anything in there that you think could be that cool um yeah i think there's a couple options actually up i think one of the options could be because i can see some questions because i can see that one machine is the lunar orbiter but like it's possible that that's the answer but you could also say that the cup that they used to measure the water that's the answer too oh i didn't think about that so it could be the lunar orbiter or it could be the cup or maybe both like maybe they use both of those kinds of equipment you know what i mean yeah that's possible okay class so let's talk about what we what we saw okay so when we were reading the character and looking at this stuff like i guess what i like to be with the stuff about like is what jumped out to me was the lunar orbiter like that's what i thought what you see what i'm still a bit confused about why my answer was wrong because i always thought that it was the lunar orbiter do you class agree he basically well i kind of agree i could see that it's an orbiter but i also think that there's other equipment that is be left out of the meeting i think that they use like you know i know that they have to use this other stuff even if it's not like satellites at radar and all that stuff to find like were even on the phone to look so i think that's confusing right way like i feel the same way cuz i'm thinking to myself like probably they use other stuff as well i'm not really sure "
27634,150.1,Luis,,"all right let's come back in 321 ","yes i got it all figured out good i think i'm ready to go back to my desk "
27641,120.4,Jazmin,,"okay so how about somebody else in your class tell me what you got to the final answer either student and student ","okay so the first time that we were getting answers i thought the answer was the lunar orbiter and i still think that's the answer because that's the small machine that that the scientists set and they're the ones that it says in the reading there the one it says they investigate with the lunar orbiter so that seems like the right answer because that tells me that they were finding finding something stuff so that tells me that they found all about the ice "
27647,130.2,Jazmin,,"Chris and you want to build on that? ","one nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that i was like why my answer wasn't wasn't right to begin with you know i said it was a small machine like i guess i just wanted like what was missing from my answer "
27650,130.1,Jazmin,,"right so in the same way like how i spoke to eastern before it's not necessarily that your answer was completely wrong you class just all had parts of the answer correct ","yeah that makes sense "
27654,120.4,Chris,,"okay cool and student go ahead ","so i thought when we were discussing up like i think student as a really good theory and i i could see how it could be the lunar orbiter i can i can see that now since she explained it but i still think that the question is saying like you know like what equipment could it be and it saying like it could be even more than one piece so student and i thought that the fact that they don't mention like satellite radar and even the oxygen tanks and stuff like i think we're still the class that that would be something that they have forgetting to say "
27659,130.3,Chris,,"I think, in this specific context and just finding the water at this time, they think the Lunar orbiter is what the main equipped piece of equipment that they use so that's a good that's a good point as well. ","okay gotcha "
27665,130.2,Farrah,,"cool and before we wrap up just to make sure that we're on the same page so then and then did you have a similar answers to student or something different ","so i'm student do you want to talk first so we kind of had a slightly different answer after focusing on the second paragraph we guess that probably you wanted us to see that the lunar orbiter was one of the things but even then we were still thinking that maybe it was the glass of water that they measured the 32 ounces with because that's equivalent to so we thought maybe we keep seeing lots of different like it seems like for other folks that they're able to see that there's other like they're able to guess like what kind of us we keep seeing like different pieces like the microscope and the glass and the lunar orbiter and we keep thinking they're using all right yeah i keep thinking that they're probably using all those states to do the measurements "
27671,210.3,Oliver,,"but they do they do what exactly ","a couple of men are at right "
27673,210.3,Oliver,,,"so you class "
27680,130.3,Farrah,,"yeah yeah definitely on the right track hoping to get it to measure it but helping us find it it's the lunar orbiter ","well i just wanted to say actually we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i really wanted to just say how much we enjoyed working with you and like in particular you really helped us to clarify our thinking about what we were trying to you know think about in our answers and try to like you know find the best answer that could and you also help this use evidence from the text so we knew that we needed to really prove our weight and i realized that most of us really except for except for student we didn't really prove our point because we weren't i guess we brought the microscope in but it wasn't the right answer so you helped us find both like what was the answer that we were looking for and also how to how to prove it so that was pretty cool thank you so much "
27683,130.3,Farrah,,,"hello hi how are you "
27685,130.3,Farrah,,,"oh we're great we're so excited to work with you that's great that's great "
27688,150.1,Luis,,"so i know that we had just recently read a short exit water on the moon right ","yeah yeah um so um i shouldn't be and that's already know a lot about that space "
27692,150.1,Luis,,"oh how's that sound ","sure yeah i'd love to do that "
27695,120.3,Farrah,,"alright so the main question i wanted to help you class answer today is the first question that we answered some remind me of that question ","okay the question is what equipment at scientists to us to discover water on the moon "
27698,120.4,Chris,,"great all right now let's get some more quiet hands what did we get what do we have an answer on that first question ","okay so i said that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27704,120.1,Jazmin,,"but um let's let's keep building on that right good student ","Okay. i said nasa sent a small machine "
27707,130.2,Jazmin,,"so let's build on that how can we build on that a little bit more ","well it's kind of wondering that because i don't understand why my answer is wrong "
27710,120.3,Oliver,,"well let's take a look back at the passage okay um can i get a volunteer to read a paragraph to just for some context ","okay how about you it's not so simple small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate and this lunar orbiter looks for ice deposits and a large polar quite a few years these ice are very small "
27713,120.1,Jazmin,,"good job so based on the context of that on that paragraph student do you think you want to try it again and tell us the answer ","well it sounds like the small machine "
27716,210.4,Jazmin,,"right so there's more there's more to that what else does it say about the small machine ","okay a small machine called a lunar orbiter and it looks for ice deposits "
27718,130.3,Jazmin,,"there we go yeah good job so the small machine on that you actually mentioned it's called a lunar orbit ","and so i just had to say lunar orbiter "
27722,130.3,Farrah,,"and um i also noticed you know student like how you said that they find the crater so understanding that the lunar orbiter is what we use to find ","um well i i had a different answer i said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely so um well you just said student is right but what about the microscope "
27726,130.3,Farrah,,"that is the tool that we use the lunar orbiter not a microscope ","But I guess I don't understand why. "
27729,130.3,Farrah,,,"why why it's not the microscope oh "
27736,130.3,Farrah,,,"oh no you're doing really well i just just i just wanted to know why it's the lunar orbiter it's okay it's okay if you want to talk to someone else that's okay i can work on "
27739,130.3,Chris,,,"yeah well actually it's a comment on yes i i went to nasa so i know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits "
27744,110.3,Luis,,"that's good that you actually went to nasa you actually get to see it in person and that's really cool ","yeah it was so cool they had so many things like machines and tools and space suits yeah it was amazing to watch student that was kind of like my answer to for the question and my answer was that scientists use oxygen tanks so i was just that connection i just wanted to make that connection that to discover the water on the moon they use oxygen tanks "
27747,110.3,Oliver,,"for sure yeah that's great that's great that's a great connection ","um well i just looked at the clock and it's time for us to go to lunch but i wanted to say thank you so much for for being so patient with us and giving all of us the chance to share it was really nice to work with you today thank you "
27756,150.1,Luis,,"are we good to start ","um yeah so i already know all about space i don't think i need to be in this class because i know all this stuff "
27759,230.1,Luis,,"and so maybe your answer has one of these two parts but let's see if we can make it even stronger so actually we can start with you student and i'm curious what made you say that scientists need oxygen tanks that was really smart edition ","yeah so i was thinking when i was reading when i was like you're not talking about all the materials that they need like when i watched like space shows on tv they always have oxygen tanks and like suits and stuff like that so it seems weird that they left that out "
27763,420.3,Luis,,"so my suggestion is that you look back at paragraph two to see if you can name and describe the tool that was used to find the water okay ","like just for the water "
27768,420.3,Farrah,,"so take a look at paragraph two and see if you can find that tool ","yeah i i was just wondering i was confused about like why my answer was wrong "
27776,420.3,Farrah,,"so my suggestion for both of you is that you reread paragraph two and maybe some of three and really understand what tool is being used to find the water before they use the microscope ","um i think it makes sense but i think that what's confusing to me is that like how could they find the water if they can't see the water like you know what i mean like they said that the water was like what did they say like microscopic so that means like really small right so like how did they find it if they couldn't see it "
27779,420.3,Farrah,,"so go ahead and take a look at paragraph two there and see if you can name that tool and describe a little bit of how it works ","okay i'll check it out "
27783,420.3,Chris,,,"um ya so my question is that like ok so like student said that which i think was good was that like the scientists use lots of equipment and i've been to nasa so i know that scientists use equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits and stuff like that so i guess i was like isn't that the answer for like how they found the water "
27792,120.4,Jazmin,,"is there class who thinks they might have found the tool mentioned in paragraph two ","yes my idea was that it was this small machine and i was wondering i wasn't sure like what my answer was wrong because it seems like this small machine was probably the thing that they used to find the water "
27794,210.4,Jazmin,,"to be honest i'm not a space astronauts so i'm truthfully not sure we'd have to look again at this article to see if there's a name for that small machine did you happen to notice if it was called something ","oh yeah like it's the lunar orbiter is that the answer "
27799,230.1,Oliver,,"student why did you say that this this does answer the question ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but this was really exciting thank you so much "
27801,230.1,Reach Every Reader,,,"hi "
27806,210.4,Luis,,"you might have even noticed in the article there's a title of a section called water is a valuable resource ","um yeah so i i was just gonna say i think i got this all figured out so i think i'm good "
27814,420.3,Farrah,,"my suggestion is that you go back to the paragraph for both of you and take a look to see if there's some reason maybe even two reasons why water could be helpful ","yeah we can do that "
27826,420.3,Chris,,"student and student reread paragraph four to find out why water would be better on the moon ","well cuz i was thinking you don't even need to take it anymore cuz if it's on the moon you don't even need to bring it with you "
27830,230.3,Jazmin,,"which ties into what you said before about it being really heavy so it sounds like you're saying it could be valuable to have it on the moon just so that you can save on the rocket fuel to bring it there ","yes i was just going to say i'm still kind of confused "
27834,420.2,Jazmin,,"so maybe you could add to your answer a bit about how it would be helpful to have it there on the moon ready to go since astronauts need to drink it ","oh that makes a lot of sense okay let me change my answer "
27839,420.3,Luis,,"right and we haven't mentioned the moon in our answer so my suggestion is that you take a look at either paragraph four or paragraph five to find at least two reasons why you would want water on the moon ","yeah so like you're saying like i should have some reason like like okay yeah like the water does this they can do that like why is it is that right "
27842,420.2,Luis,,"exactly similar to student you've told us why it's really helpful we just want to add a little bit about why it's helpful to have it on the moon ","i can do that "
27845,120.4,Oliver,,"Does anyone have an answer that they want to share with their group when they've improved. ","yeah so i read that there was going to be a base on the moon by 2024 "
27847,230.1,Oliver,,"is that something you read in the article is that some knowledge that you're bringing to the conversation ","oh that's a good question um i read it online "
27851,410.1,Oliver,,"i'm concerned, though, that the question is asking specifically about water ","okay "
27859,120.4,Farrah,,"does someone to have a response they might want to share with the class ","on okay so i thought about some of the ways that it could be valuable and at still like okay so i think i might still make the argument that it might not be valuable yet but maybe it will be valuable once we have the like i think the word is infrastructure infrastructure and you like once we have that like the equipment and stuff on the we could use it a lot i still think it's probably in the future but i did look at what you said in the paragraph and i could see that there was stuff that would be really valuable like you can use it to drink you can make rocket fuel from it like there's a lot of stuff where certainly eventually it would be really valuable "
27868,230.3,Oliver,,"for drinking and like student had mentioned it can be used to make rocket fuel that's those are great reasons to include in your answer ","so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just wanted to say that you really helped us and like i think what was really interesting and really cool was how you explain like what we needed to work on and then you gave us ideas for like not like what the answer was but like how we could make our answers better i'd like more complete like you agree class like i think that was really fun so thank you so much because that was really cool bye "
27872,230.3,Oliver,,,"um we're good just excited to work with you "
27875,150.1,Luis,,"great fantastic so you just read water on the moon ","um so i don't think i need to be in this class because i already know all about space "
27882,120.4,Oliver,,"so i'm just interested in hearing hearing from you what your answers were ","um yeah so i circled the same thing as student "
27884,230.1,Oliver,,"can you give me a little more detail about what that was what evidence was that ","yeah so okay so survey and i said that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and i think that that class because they talk about different sort of equipment which is a word that i circled and i saw that the equipment that i noticed was the microscope "
27890,230.3,Farrah,,"and student is that right that that's what you had as well ","yeah i had the same answer "
27895,150.1,Farrah,,"can you try to do a little rereading and find some more evidence ","yeah that sounds like an interesting like ranking all of the equipment i think just i'm still a little about why my answer is wrong "
27898,420.2,Farrah,,"i didn't say that your answer was wrong i think that you found a piece of evidence from from the article but i wonder if you could have a stronger answer if you did a little ranking and sorting of other pieces of evidence ","that makes sense okay i'm gonna try that "
27903,150.1,Chris,,"so student and student i'm going to ask you to try that suggestion first ","yeah yeah so basically what i said is that scientists found craters full of water on the moon "
27909,110.1,Chris,,"student i see you i'm going to come back to you once i'm done with student ","ya so it says that in the first paragraph up top scientists have evidence that water can be deep within the moon's polar craters and these craters are dark places where the sun never shines so that makes me think that they're probably full off water "
27918,410.2,Chris,,"so i'm concerned student that you took your answer only from the first paragraph but there's more information about how much water there is on the moon later in the article ","because i i went to so with like that so i know that scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits at that's not in the reading that i saw so i understand like maybe the reading doesn't have everything but also maybe i need to read a little more closely "
27922,210.4,Chris,,"and i also wonder if some equipment is used for some jobs in space and some different equipment is used for different jobs so i wonder if looking for water on the moon requires some different different equipment than some of the things that you're talking about ","that's a really good point "
27924,420.2,Chris,,"so why don't you try to do a little bit of rereading and maybe adding on maybe elaborating on your answer a little bit after you reread ","okay "
27929,110.1,Farrah,,"student and student i'm going to get to you in just a second i see that student and student have their hands up ","yeah thank you so unfortunately we have to go to lunch but before we go to lunch i just want to say that i know that our time was really short but i really appreciate it how you have to clarify what we were so that we could address like what to our answers because you really thought about like what you were concerned about and even a question about how we could work on what we were and that was really helpful and i know that student knew and student knew exactly what to do to try to improve our answers so thank you so much it was really fun bye "
