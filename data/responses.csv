500,Chris,agree,177,"right,chris,explain,evidence",Like Farrah said it's like something from the story that answers the question
500,Chris,agree,17332,"drawing,prior,knowledge,these,things,complex,reviewing,couple,times,important,chris,something","well I didn't go to space, but I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of the equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
400,Chris,agree,153,"remembers,oliver,asked,equipment,oliver,right,words,chris,question",yeah well actually it's a comment  so I went to NASA so I know that scientists they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
400,Chris,agree,182,"chris,question",Will I  I went to NASA so I know that scientists use all lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
400,Chris,agree,1841,"that's,great,things,since,class,learning,environment,skills,reread,articles,these,details,moment,chris","Now I'm trying to what I just looked at the clock and that's our time for us to go, so we'll have to talk to you again and see you later"
400,Chris,agree,7925,"chris,equipment,tools",I actually had kind of a question
400,Chris,agree,7926,"chris,equipment,tools","I'm like, I'm basically like a I was sort of wondering like, so my dad took me to NASA"
400,Chris,agree,7926,"chris,equipment,tools","So actually, I was kind of wondering because like that seems like like those, would those be tools?"
400,Chris,agree,7927,"chris,equipment,tools",We saw like all of these like space suits and equipment like that
400,Chris,agree,9412,"chris,answer","OK, so my answer was that water is heavy"
400,Chris,agree,9412,"chris,answer",So it's good that they don't have to carry it in the ships
400,Chris,agree,10817,"chris,talked,about,found,craters",I went to NASA
400,Chris,agree,11705,"chris,response,great,scientists,found,craters,water,that's,correct",I did the same ones that Jazmin did I highlighted the Lunar orbiter a small machine called a lunar orbiter and the scientific tool called a microscope
400,Chris,agree,13168,"information,texts,direct,quotes,names,machines,instead,generalizing,chris",I read that there could be a moon base on the moon by 2024
400,Chris,agree,13997,"chris,something","Well, I went to NASA"
400,Chris,agree,13998,"chris,something",So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
400,Chris,agree,16072,"friends,attention,keywords,question,think,critically,about,answer,question,words,keywords,stand,chris",So I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
400,Chris,agree,17362,"chris,share,would,water,exists,differently,earth,happen,answer",Oh okay oh it's in craters its in craters on the moon
400,Chris,agree,18535,"absolutely,something,caught,water,doesn't,quite,answer,question,about,being,piece,equipment,scientists,using,chris,follow,about",because that was my answer it first about the craters
400,Chris,agree,19143,"thank,sharing,chris,would,share,there,change,answer,anything,response,compelling",we've been talking about equipment on this whole time so I should probably put equipment in my answer
400,Chris,agree,19870,"looking,specifically,context,that's,really,great,question,chris,thank",yeah thanks teacher okay
400,Chris,agree,21082,"right,jazmin,chris,reread,paragraph,would,better","Well, cuz I was thinking"
300,Chris,agree,18393,"awesome,great,telling,small,machine,wasn't,necessarily,small,machine,really,great,showing,understood,excellent,chris,right,ahead","yeah I was thinking about equipment, since a circle that in the text and I went to NASA so I know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and suits"
300,Chris,agree,19108,"using,visualization,skills,chris,revise,thinking,there",yeah I also I can really picture it because I went to NASA and I found out that that scientists use all lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks and masks and suits
300,Chris,agree,19142,"thank,that's,stated,showed,thinking,chris",I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
300,Chris,agree,19185,"critical,thinking,farrah,looking,answer,awesome,let's,oliver,farrah,let's,chris","Well, I just wanted to share I went to NASA so I know that scientists they they use a lot of equipment like like oxygen tanks like Luis said but also masks and suits"
300,Chris,agree,19939,"chris,farrah,either,share,chris","yeah yeah I wanted to know if my new answer was okay  the water, the scientists found on the moon was microscopic is that OK"
300,Chris,agree,20405,"because,that's,question,asking,asking,piece,equipment,chris,question","wasn't a question teacher, I was just looking at the clock and it looks like it's time for us to go to lunch on what I wanted to say thank you for"
300,Chris,agree,20992,"chris,build",One nice thing to say just just as part of my answer was that I was
200,Chris,agree,100,"right,everyone,welcome,thank,those,answers,chris,start,answer,chris,about,answer","yeah I was looking for the keywords about like discovering water on the moon, and in the first paragraph there's a part where they say water can be found deep within the moon's polar craters so that kind of felt like it"
200,Chris,agree,1243,"chris,discover",We know that the moon is dry
200,Chris,agree,2199,"farrah,maybe,keyword,keyword,discover,maybe,keyword,discover,trying,something,helps,locate,where,water,found,chris","Well, I just, I, I kind of like, okay, I was thinking about out my dad took me to NASA"
200,Chris,agree,4085,"chris,investigate,there","So I think like they investigated the craters and they found them all full water, which was pretty cool"
200,Chris,agree,5004,"details,chris","So we know that, like, there's a few things that you could do"
200,Chris,agree,6452,"those,important,words,chris","So for me, I thought, well, I thought, water and value"
200,Chris,agree,6882,"chris,convincing","If, if your friend wants to do something and you don't want to do it and they like the try to get you to do with a big that's convincing"
200,Chris,agree,7681,"stuff,chris,actually,wrote,about,stuff,another,benefit","Yeah, so I said that water is heavy"
200,Chris,agree,8114,"let's,chris","I was looking at, like, , I guess, Lunar Orbiter"
200,Chris,agree,8114,"let's,chris",So I kind of went in
200,Chris,agree,8405,"where,answer,chris","So that's, that's where I got my part"
200,Chris,agree,8405,"where,answer,chris","My answer from the first part where it talks about the the craters because it says, scientists have evidence, the water can be found deep within the moon polar craters"
200,Chris,agree,8445,"chris,about,scientists,found,craters,water","Cuz question was asking, you know them, finding the water like like how Oliver said, so I was looking at the text"
200,Chris,agree,8452,"chris,equipment,comes","Like those oxygen tanks, so that they breathe and like, there's the suit so that they don't like freeze to death, you know,"
200,Chris,agree,8630,"guess,chris,soften,answer","Because you could do a scanner or like, something like that"
200,Chris,agree,8631,"guess,chris,soften,answer",So maybe you didn't need the microscope
200,Chris,agree,8631,"guess,chris,soften,answer","Well, I guess I'm not sure like which equipment"
200,Chris,agree,8632,"guess,chris,soften,answer","You know what I mean, like, I'm assing they're like Probes stuff like that"
200,Chris,agree,8648,"according,passage,chris,passage,saying,scientists,water","Oh well, I guess, like the passage is saying like, you have to use the microscope"
500,Farrah,agree,7915,"where,using,farrah","So like the arm so like the key, the key word would be like what, what, like equipment like equipment"
500,Farrah,agree,10755,"least,farrah,about,think,start,strategy,either,build,change,future","So I started by saying that it was the Microscope that they found the water with because I was so my thinking was if they couldn't see it, they couldn't find it, but when I read read it sounds like they had other sensors that could find the water"
500,Farrah,agree,17278,"farrah,oliver,chris,questions,second,farrah,wanted,change,answer,change","Well Okay, so the first time I thought Okay, the microscope is the equipment, you have to use"
400,Farrah,agree,92,"question,equipment,scientists,sentence,mentioned,scientists,actually,microscope,farrah",but we want to find a piece of equipment that the scientists actually used here
400,Farrah,agree,149,"saying,equipment,scientist,discover,water,maybe,keywords,equipment,because,lunar,orbiter,small,machine,lunar,orbiter,specific,example,farrah","Okay well microscope that's also equipment so , why is it the Lunar orbiter and not the microscope"
400,Farrah,agree,502,"oliver,instead,answer,being,circled,farrah,could,instead,saying,circled","me and Farrah both found the same thing right, Farrah?"
400,Farrah,agree,5015,"evidence,there,could,could,because,that's,think,that's,you're,struggling,farrah,right",It seems like it would take a lot of money and time
400,Farrah,agree,6549,"instead,agreeing,farrah,maybe,think,about,agree,farrah","Oh yeah, I could tell you"
400,Farrah,agree,11211,"wanted,personal,thinking,thought,answer,question,farrah","Yeah, cuz you asked her for her answer first and she circled the same thing that I did have I circled the last sentence which says arm YOU NEED A SCIENTIFIC POLL ON A microscope to look really closely"
400,Farrah,agree,12906,"think,that's,really,point,let's,think,farrah,thoughts,could,answer,little,stronger","Iguess Okay, so I could try"
400,Farrah,agree,12911,"think,that's,really,answer,think,could,little,further,maybe,quoting,getting,information,farrah","So, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch we go to lunch, I just wanted to thank you for for working with us and, like, in particular, I just really wanted to thank you for"
400,Farrah,agree,13134,"being,write,answer,beneficial,instead,farrah","I mean, I understood it was just that Farrah went first, so she said her answer and mine was the same"
400,Farrah,agree,13628,"example,farrah,answer,answer,words,describe,thought,about",My English teacher says that to say it in your own words
400,Farrah,agree,13629,"example,farrah,answer,answer,words,describe,thought,about",I could do that
400,Farrah,agree,14423,"little,concerned,farrah",I don't understand why that answers wrong
400,Farrah,agree,14424,"little,concerned,farrah",Yeah I said you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely
400,Farrah,agree,16280,"should,important,parts,someone,raise,their,farrah","Well, I think the most important words in the question they kind of tell you what to look for when you read the story"
400,Farrah,agree,18827,"farrah,think","Okay, well, I thought the most important word would be equipment"
400,Farrah,agree,19253,"farrah,mentioned,microscope,right","Oh yes, yes, that was my answer, I said I said, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely and, and so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
400,Farrah,agree,19291,"treasure,right,could,second,circle,words,question,you'd,looking,farrah",edu Oh yeah i'm still kind of confused
400,Farrah,agree,20399,"response,answer,circle,farrah,answer,question,words","Okay sure  so I say, the answer is okay well I circle this part of the text on the answer is on the equipment, you need as a microscope to look closely at the water"
300,Farrah,agree,6199,"answered,farrah","So I would say, I guess it was sort of similar, but basically what I would say like in my own words"
300,Farrah,agree,11945,"chris,farrah,found,specific,information,great",Well I don't understand why my answer's wrong
300,Farrah,agree,21148,"farrah,you've,waiting,patiently,first",", Nice work using the passage to…)"
300,Farrah,agree,21148,"farrah,you've,waiting,patiently,first",Affirms student by recognizing their perspective 
200,Farrah,agree,30,"where,where,found,their,answer,texts,farrah","OK, so my answer is that you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely on and about my my thinking so I found it in part three, and it talks about how the water is microscopic and you can't see it without a microscope"
200,Farrah,agree,91,"farrah,again,where,found,story","yeah i'm Okay, so it says, well, I mean that's the same it's this that's what it says it says, you need a scientific tool called a microscope to look really closely"
200,Farrah,agree,94,"oliver,answer,farrah,answer"," yeah yeah, I can tell you Oh, you know what while he's looking did you I went to NASA and I do know that scientists use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks and masks and"
200,Farrah,agree,112,"farrah,reasoning,similar,olivers,answer,different"," I mean, I guess, he was pretty similar yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong"
200,Farrah,agree,548,"you're,welcome,oliver,circled,thing,farrah","Yeah, I had a microscope and I kind of thought"
200,Farrah,agree,1029,"oliver,circled,answer,farrah,challenge,where,where,talks,about,microscope,because","Well, yeah, it's the last, the last sentence"
200,Farrah,agree,1029,"oliver,circled,answer,farrah,challenge,where,where,talks,about,microscope,because","I circled it in the last paragraph, but it was just hard Farrah said her answer before mine and she have the same answer as me"
200,Farrah,agree,1149,"think,farrah","I think the questions asking us, okay, so it says"
500,Jazmin,agree,10739,"we're,around,jazmin,think,first,you're,strategy,changed,build,assignment","So for me, what I noticed was that basically what you pointed out was that my answer was right but it was incomplete"
500,Jazmin,agree,20074,"thank,jazmin,you've,changed,process,working,through,questions","Okay  so for my process at first, I was just looking for"
500,Jazmin,agree,20546,"welcome,lunch,we'll,where,jazmin,talked,about,earlier,specify,specifying,techniques,responses,maybe,future,ehtan"," Okay, so I think I got this all figured out so I'm all good"
400,Jazmin,agree,56,"let's,think,about,specific,jazmin,because,you're,absolutely,right,small,machine,something,that's,specific,information,about,small,machine",Oh well in the part I just read it says they use it to investigate and look for iced deposits
400,Jazmin,agree,268,"second,write,answer,jazmin",I think I know the answer
400,Jazmin,agree,986,"jazmin,small,machine","Okay, because I don't understand why my answer is wrong"

400,Jazmin,agree,7935,"jazmin,think","What I think is, so it's like what I said was, like, the small machine"
400,Jazmin,agree,7936,"jazmin,think","It's like a lunar orbiter right so you would that that's one, two, that you would have to use right like to get there"
400,Jazmin,agree,7936,"jazmin,think",And then when I was thinking about like the tool and like how you would pick what this like how you would use this machine
400,Jazmin,agree,12065,"you're,saying,discover,water,you're,necessarily,saying,equipment,order,strengthen,response,might,something,about,equipment,farrah,jazmin,added","Okay, oh so like scientists"

400,Jazmin,agree,16246,"thank,sharing,jazmin","I was thinking, another really important one is convincing because your reasons like your evidence after be really glad, or else the people listening to your answer"
400,Jazmin,agree,17178,"don't,think,answers,jazmin,wondering,little,evidence,small,machine,you're,saying","out okay so well, I found it in the story, I found it in paragraph two"
400,Jazmin,agree,17746,"alright,jazmin,answer,almost,there,you've,little,specific,small,machine,which,absolutely,small,machine,called","Well, we said it already, it's the Lunar orbiter"

400,Jazmin,agree,19824,"maybe,because,expensive,they're,sending,these,machines,called,lunar,orbiter,think,situation,they're,actually,using,oxygen,tanks,that's,great,point,event,jazmin","Yes, okay well, so my answer was that NASA sent a small machine, so I don't understand why my answer is wrong"
400,Jazmin,agree,20954,"jazmin,question",I was just wondering why my answer was wrong
400,Jazmin,agree,21090,"exactly,similar,jazmin,you've,helpful,little,about,helpful",I can do that
300,Jazmin,agree,481,"that's,thinking,about,jazmin",I just want to thank you for working with this and like in particular
300,Jazmin,agree,481,"that's,thinking,about,jazmin","And yet, I just wanted to say"
300,Jazmin,agree,482,"that's,thinking,about,jazmin",And we have to match the lunch
300,Jazmin,agree,5011,"jazmin,water,valuable,really,discuss","I think I just, I'm still a little confused"
300,Jazmin,agree,11426,"thank,jazmin,explaining,answer,using",So I know that time does use a lot of equipment like oxygen tanks masks and suits
300,Jazmin,agree,11427,"thank,jazmin,explaining,answer,using",And I went to NASA
200,Jazmin,agree,77,"right,jazmin,about,answer,small,machine",yeah I don't understand why my answers wrong
200,Jazmin,agree,82,"awesome,jazmin,could,rewrite,answer,include,piece,information",i'm okay  NASA sent a small machine
200,Jazmin,agree,120,"jazmin,something,didn't",yeah I said NASA send a small machine
200,Jazmin,agree,122,"that's,awesome,found,question,small,machine,jazmin,machine,doing",It lands at the moon South Pole and looks for ice deposits in a large polar crater
200,Jazmin,agree,1164,"would,where,think,might,answer,equipment,discover,water,jazmin",And I would say that it's in paragraph two and that's where you would find that like where you will find the equipment used to discover the water
200,Jazmin,agree,1171,"jazmin,could,please,paragraph,sentence,where,think,answers,question,about,equipment,using,discover,water",In the first sentence in paragraph 2
200,Jazmin,agree,1171,"jazmin,could,please,paragraph,sentence,where,think,answers,question,about,equipment,using,discover,water","It says, NASA send a small machine called a lunar orbiter to investigate"
200,Jazmin,agree,1173,"farrah,jazmin,answer,change,would,would,answer,still,believe,paragraph,three","Well, I guess I can see how the small machine or I guess the lunar orbiter is the small machine like I could see how that was used to discover"
200,Jazmin,agree,1187,"farrah,relate,jazmin,saying,where,lunar,orbiter,actually,discover,water,microscope,study,water",That does mean a lot of sense
200,Jazmin,agree,1868,"jazmin,absolutely","I mean, I use"
200,Jazmin,agree,1869,"jazmin,absolutely","I said, I'm not too small machine, but I'm in this group"
200,Jazmin,agree,1870,"jazmin,absolutely",So why is my answer
200,Jazmin,agree,3951,"jazmin,discover","I'm discovering like when you find them, but like, it's when you find them for the first time"
200,Jazmin,agree,4871,jazmin,"Hmm, I guess, well, I was just thinking about what you could do with water, and seeing it's not really in there, I was just thinking that if you could use the water that's one thing"
200,Jazmin,agree,4872,jazmin,I was looking at
200,Jazmin,agree,5007,"drink,rocket,everything,jazmin","Oh, you can breathe it, they said that you can breathe it if you make oxygen"
200,Jazmin,agree,5007,"drink,rocket,everything,jazmin","Reach Every ReaderYou can drink it, you can make rocket fuel"
200,Jazmin,agree,6744,"small,machine,called,lunar,orbiter,investigate,jazmin,think,lunar,orbiter,would",It's like a spaceship that goes up to the moon and can study things
200,Jazmin,agree,8393,"let's,jazmin,equipment,scientists,discover,water","Well, I don't understand why my answer is wrong, cuz I did pull from that I said a small machine"
200,Jazmin,agree,8393,"let's,jazmin,equipment,scientists,discover,water","And that's a word to look for like equipment machine, you know?"
200,Jazmin,agree,8933,"jazmin,small,machine",Should you call on him first?
200,Jazmin,agree,8934,"jazmin,small,machine","I think, but I think Chris has his hand up"
200,Jazmin,agree,9586,jazmin,So I guess what I saw was like that the moon is really like a desert like it's really dry and there's just a little bit of water there
200,Jazmin,agree,9593,"we're,coming,jazmin,small,machine","So in paragraph two, it says that NASA sent a small machine called a Lunar Orbiter to investigate"
200,Jazmin,agree,9815,"jazmin,small,machine",I guess I don't understand why my answer is wrong
500,Luis,agree,1576,"how's,thinking,changed,since,beginning",I'm not totally sure
500,Luis,agree,17268,"lunar,orbiter,exactly,conclusion,answer","Well Okay, so you said that I needed to use details in the answer, and so, when I went and looked back in the in the reading"
500,Luis,agree,19119,"share,thinking,changed,thinking","Okay, well, I thought there were astronauts  but now I know there are the astronauts, and so it has to be a different equipment and the ones that they say and what story are the small machine i'm a microscope so now I think those are the answers"
500,Luis,agree,19650,"great,you're,participating,already,would,telling,you're,thinking,revise,response","yeah sure So my first answer once about oxygen tanks, which i'm well, I still kind of think that's true, but you have to use evidence from this story for this question so, then I found the equipment and the story, which is the machine"
500,Luis,agree,19935,"noticed,through,talking,added,specificity,answer,think,helped,response",yeah yeah cuz it's got a lot of specificity
400,Luis,agree,74,"wondering,information,specific,piece,equipment,mentioned","Oh okay, let me see, now they know water deep craters. Small machine that's equipment lunar orbiter, it's not your microscopic scientific tool that's equipment microscope that's clear but OK so there's four four times they mentioned equipment in the story"
400,Luis,agree,104,"awesome,chris,piece,equipment,scientists,awesome,ready",yeah okay  I don't think i'm a should be in this group I already know all about space
400,Luis,agree,8372,"talked,about,paragraphs,information,jazmin,found,found",But before we go to lunch
400,Luis,agree,8373,"talked,about,paragraphs,information,jazmin,found,found","So unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
400,Luis,agree,8373,"talked,about,paragraphs,information,jazmin,found,found",I really just wanted to thank you
400,Luis,agree,10942,"pause,second,don't,interpret,sentence",The lunar orbiter-- the lunar orbiter to investigate ice deposits
400,Luis,agree,12277,"anyone,include,evidence","Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group"
400,Luis,agree,12278,"anyone,include,evidence",I already know all about space
300,Luis,agree,19193,"hello,everyone,thank,sharing,answers,everything,understood,passage,great,looking,answers",I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space
200,Luis,agree,73,"don't,about,answer","That scientists use oxygen tanks, while cuz I know that's something that they have to do is if they're ever going to go to space"
200,Luis,agree,75,"awesome,which,piece,equipment,think,important","Oh, I don't know"
200,Luis,agree,106,"trying,mention,those,oxygen,tanks"," Okay, to be honest, I didn't really read that whole thing cuz I figured I already knew the answer"
200,Luis,agree,862,"anything,talking,about,oxygen","No, it wasn't about oxygen"
200,Luis,agree,862,"anything,talking,about,oxygen",It was just about ice and ice and water in this first part
200,Luis,agree,1096,"evidence,looking,answer,different,question",To two pieces of equipment
200,Luis,agree,1096,"evidence,looking,answer,different,question","The small machine that Jazmin was reading about, and then the microscope that Oliver and Farrah were talking about"
200,Luis,agree,1593,"scientists,equipment,oxygen,tanks,question,asking,about,using,something,savanah",I was going to say that in my answer I did talk about the equipment I talked about the microscope and they use a microscope to look for the water
200,Luis,agree,1593,"scientists,equipment,oxygen,tanks,question,asking,about,using,something,savanah",So I don't know why my answers wrong
200,Luis,agree,1594,"scientists,equipment,oxygen,tanks,question,asking,about,using,something,savanah",So I have both of those
200,Luis,agree,2182,quickly,", you know, I actually was thinking about all that I knew about space and I kind of knew that, you know, the scientists use lots of equipment like oxygen tanks and"
200,Luis,agree,2290,"chris,ready,deeper,another,answer","Like, I don't understand, like, did the astronauts who saw the water, did they use a microscope"
200,Luis,agree,2291,"chris,ready,deeper,another,answer",But I guess I'm confused
200,Luis,agree,2291,"chris,ready,deeper,another,answer","Well, I guess like it makes sense that like you would have to use those things"
200,Luis,agree,2292,"chris,ready,deeper,another,answer","Like, it sounds like the answer of Jazmin's is like kind of right but it sounds like Oliver and Farrah"
200,Luis,agree,2297,thinking,"I gotta look at the paragraph, so I gotta see"
200,Luis,agree,2297,thinking,So if I look at it after I looked at it and listen to Jazmin's answer like
200,Luis,agree,2298,thinking,"I'm like, I'm like, I'm kind of thinking that, like, I understand"
200,Luis,agree,4829,"machines,little,further",", they use oxygen masks and they use spacesuits and they use the like the space shuttle itself that's that's also a machine to you want you want me to say more, because I know like a lot more machines too"
200,Luis,agree,5094,mentioned,I guess it's not in the text that they used it
200,Luis,agree,6867,oxygen,And helps them breathe
200,Luis,agree,6885,convincing,I'm well I convince everybody that I'm like I'm the best at Minecraft ever
200,Luis,agree,7323,"think,about,space",so you wanted to talk to us
200,Luis,agree,7323,"think,about,space","Well, cuz you know when you're working with us because we we didn't have the right answer"
200,Luis,agree,7324,"think,about,space",So I feel like I kind of know everything
200,Luis,agree,8516,"words,could,underline,question,answer,answer",So I put in for my answer
200,Luis,agree,8850,"where,answer","I don't think I really need to be in this group, because I don't really need help with this stuff, you know,"
200,Luis,agree,8851,"where,answer",So I already kind of knew the answer to this question
200,Luis,agree,8852,"where,answer","Okay, so I got my answer from like I know about like space and stuff"
200,Luis,agree,8942,"however,paragraph,where,talks,about,machine","So I guess I just like I kind of know all this stuff, you know,"
200,Luis,agree,8943,"however,paragraph,where,talks,about,machine",", yeah, I guess"
200,Luis,agree,9711,"there's,paragraph",", yeah, I think, like, okay, you could use it or okay well you could breathe it"
200,Luis,agree,9712,"there's,paragraph",", and then it says oxygen and hydrogen could also be used as rocket fuel"
200,Luis,agree,9976,sounds,"Okay yeah Okay, I guess that's fine okay"
200,Luis,agree,10291,"answer,scientists,equipment,oxygen,tanks,think,oxygen,tanks,piece,equipment,scientists","Okay, so I know about space, and I know that they can't breathe up in space and like Chris said, you know they use a lot of different equipment and so on oxygen tank is one that they have to use"
200,Luis,agree,10350,"discussing,trying,expand,sentences,would,other,passages","edu Excuse me, I shouldn't be in this group I already know all about space"
500,Oliver,agree,17593,"important,focus,important,passage,determine,answer,question,always,helpful,circle,words,question,oliver,think",Agile Teacher Lab  well
500,Oliver,agree,18274,"let's,think,about,together,together,figure,called,oliver","Okay, so what we did is we, we reread, we reread the text and we found both both pieces of equipment, but then we found out what each one does that's different and which one was that best to answer for the question"
400,Oliver,agree,11118,"examples,discovered,reading,examples,jazmin,farrah,oliver,let's,let's,figure,together","I mean, I know Jazmin said something about a lunar orbiter"
400,Oliver,agree,16079,"sense,oliver","And I'm actually, it's, it's time for us to go right now, but I wanted to say thank you for really emphasizing the key word discover and how if we look for a word, kind of like it in the story will find the very best to answer"
400,Oliver,agree,16080,"sense,oliver","Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense"
400,Oliver,agree,19144,"oliver,about,ahead,maybe,what's,might,added,response",Agile Teacher Lab yeah okay  so originally I was thinking
300,Oliver,agree,17280,"oliver,raised,before","Well, I was just gonna say that I think that they're gonna try to build a base by 2024 which would be really cool"
200,Oliver,agree,17,"farrah,oliver,ready,answer,investigate,other,answers,first","Okay well  so we we saw where it said lunar orbiter and we also heard you tell Jazmin that lunar orbiter is the right answer, and so I guess, I guess, I know that now, but I don't know  how I how I would have picked lunar orbiter instead of microscope does that make sense"
200,Oliver,agree,110,"answer,question,oliver",i'm cause the questions asking arm what equipment data scientists used to discover water on the moon and i'm in this in this part of the story house
200,Oliver,agree,178,"oliver,asked,equipment,scientists,discover,water,would,answer,using,textual,evidence","Okay, well, I mean I guess it sounds like the right answer is, you know, lunar orbiter , and that's in the text, but I kind of think there's evidence that  the microscope's the right answer too"
200,Oliver,agree,3835,"study,oliver","So what I wanted to add was just that, unfortunately, we have to go to lunch, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for working with us"
200,Oliver,agree,4886,"right,oxygen,breathe,hydrogen,oliver","I really just wanted to thank you and I wanted to thank you, particularly for helping us to clarify our thinking"
200,Oliver,agree,4886,"right,oxygen,breathe,hydrogen,oliver",But before we go to lunch
200,Oliver,agree,4887,"right,oxygen,breathe,hydrogen,oliver","Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
200,Oliver,agree,5724,"water,don't,oliver","Unfortunately, we have to go on to the next group, but thank you"
200,Oliver,agree,6643,"savanahh,oliver,finish,that's",It's like finding something
200,Oliver,agree,8251,"think,valuable,resource,oliver",And then rocket fuel seems like pretty important you know you need rocket fuel in order to go to space
200,Oliver,agree,8252,"think,valuable,resource,oliver","I mean, like everybody needs to drink water"
200,Oliver,agree,8252,"think,valuable,resource,oliver",Okay cause on the thing that Jazmin said about drinking it
200,Oliver,agree,8326,oliver,I just really wanted to thank you for working with us was really fun to work with
200,Oliver,agree,8326,oliver,But before we go to our next class
200,Oliver,agree,8327,oliver,"Unfortunately, we have to go to our next class"
200,Oliver,agree,8327,oliver, I just wanted to say
200,Oliver,agree,8440,"oliver,answer,choice",So I was looking for a place where they talked about discovering the water
200,Oliver,agree,8440,"oliver,answer,choice",And I know that we have to find equipment
200,Oliver,agree,8441,"oliver,answer,choice","Well, I know that the question was asking for water"
200,Oliver,agree,8589,"passage,oliver",And you need a microscope to see the water
200,Oliver,agree,8839,"oliver,underline,paragraph"," yeah, basically, that was on the same because it was all the equipment that I could see"
200,Oliver,agree,8866,"oliver,think,there's,another,answer,other,small,microscope","Okay, so when when we talk about it together"
200,Oliver,agree,8867,"oliver,think,there's,another,answer,other,small,microscope","Like, I guess you need the Lunar Orbiter"
200,Oliver,agree,8867,"oliver,think,there's,another,answer,other,small,microscope"," yeah, I guess, actually"
200,Oliver,agree,8868,"oliver,think,there's,another,answer,other,small,microscope","But, , I guess it kind of still think it's like I kind of still think it's the"
200,Oliver,agree,9164,"let's,quick,before,oliver",And I think that was the thing right like
200,Oliver,agree,9164,"let's,quick,before,oliver",So I think it was a trick question because I did not find it
200,Oliver,agree,9431,"let's,let's,consider,hypothetical,situation,where,oliver","But, , I just wanted to thank you so much for working with us today"
200,Oliver,agree,9432,"let's,let's,consider,hypothetical,situation,where,oliver","Again, we have to watch this"
200,Oliver,agree,9432,"let's,let's,consider,hypothetical,situation,where,oliver","Unfortunately, we have to go to lunch"
200,Oliver,agree,10005,"usually,similarities,between,earth,anyone,earth,oliver",I was looking at the clock and it's time for us to go so we'll see you later bye
200,Oliver,agree,10507,"orbit,discover,water,already,would,semana,oliver,would,microscope,sample,water,found,makes,sense","was my answer is, it is"
200,Oliver,agree,10652,"awesome,alright,oliver,where,information,about,microscope","Okay, so when I was looking at it"
200,Oliver,agree,11012,"oliver,circle",I circled equipment and water
200,Oliver,agree,11012,"oliver,circle",I circled the same thing
200,Oliver,agree,11191,"farrah,water,heavy,there's,space,water,bring,people,that's,awesome,oliver",Agile Teacher Lab  well I read that there could be a base on the moon by 2024
200,Oliver,agree,14918,"oliver,would,share","Yeah, I had a different keyword from Chris and mine was on equipment"
200,Oliver,agree,16336,"oliver,remember,action,question"," yeah I think Jazmin said it, and it was discover"
200,Oliver,agree,17311,"chris's,point,utilize,oxygen,equipment,because,wasn't,actually,astronauts,surface,collecting,lunar,orbiter,equipment,oliver,what's",i'm so sorry I just looked at the clock and
200,Oliver,agree,17685,"oliver,wrote,response,about,microscope","Well, I, since you were telling Jazmin the thing that she said was was the right one, then I think i'm gonna change my answer from the microscope to  the lunar orbiter"
200,Oliver,agree,17757,"different,tools,different,tasks,right,oliver"," yeah i'm so sorry but I just looked at the clock out, we have to go to lunch right now"
200,Oliver,agree,17769,"learned,scientists,needed,equipment,think,needed,equipment,couldn't,scientists,their,touch,their,hands,ahead,oliver","So actually in the text it says the water, because we know that are looking for water is really, really, really, really, really small so they can't just look at it, they need equipment to help them find it"
